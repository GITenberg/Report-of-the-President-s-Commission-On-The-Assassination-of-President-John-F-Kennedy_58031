<p>Footnote notation: In the original book, the footnote numbering
sequence began at “1” in the Foreword and in each Chapter and Appendix.
To make these numbers unique in this eBook, they have been modified
to include a prefix that identifies the Chapter or Appendix to which
they belong, e.g., F-1, C5-46,
A12-115. Simple numbers in square brackets, e.g., [212], were shown
that way in the original text. Bottom-of-page footnotes
were shown as asterisks "*" in the original text, but were changed here to
sequential letters, e.g., "A". In the orignal text, a few missing letters were
added in square brackets, e.g., [W]e, and are shown that way here.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">President Lyndon B. Johnson</span>, by Executive Order No. 11130 dated
November 29, 1963,<a id="FNanchor_F-1" href="#Footnote_F-1" class="fnanchor">F-1</a> created this Commission to investigate the
assassination on November 22, 1963, of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the
35th President of the United States. The President directed the
Commission to evaluate all the facts and circumstances surrounding
the assassination and the subsequent killing of the alleged assassin
and to report its findings and conclusions to him.<a id="FNanchor_F-2" href="#Footnote_F-2" class="fnanchor">F-2</a></p>

<p>The subject of the Commission’s inquiry was a chain of events
which saddened and shocked the people of the United States and of
the world. The assassination of President Kennedy and the simultaneous
wounding of John B. Connally, Jr., Governor of Texas, had
been followed within an hour by the slaying of Patrolman J. D. Tippit
of the Dallas Police Department. In the United States and abroad,
these events evoked universal demands for an explanation.</p>

<p>Immediately after the assassination, State and local officials in
Dallas devoted their resources to the apprehension of the assassin.
The U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for the protection of the
President, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation began an investigation
at the direction of President Johnson. Within 35 minutes of the
killing of Patrolman Tippit, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested by
the Dallas police as a suspect in that crime. Based on evidence provided
by Federal, State, and local agencies, the State of Texas
arraigned Oswald within 12 hours of his arrest, charging him with
the assassination of President Kennedy and the murder of Patrolman
Tippit. On November 24, 1963, less than 48 hours after his arrest,
Oswald was fatally shot in the basement of the Dallas Police Department
by Jack Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner. This shooting took
place in full view of a national television audience.</p>

<p>The events of these 2 days were witnessed with shock and disbelief
by a Nation grieving the loss of its young leader. Throughout the
world, reports on these events were disseminated in massive detail.
Theories and speculations mounted regarding the assassination. In
many instances, the intense public demand for facts was met by partial
and frequently conflicting reports from Dallas and elsewhere. After
Oswald’s arrest and his denial of all guilt, public attention focused
both on the extent of the evidence against him and the possibility
of a conspiracy, domestic or foreign. His subsequent death
heightened public interest and stimulated additional suspicions and
rumors.</p>

<h3>THE COMMISSION AND ITS POWERS</h3>

<p>After Lee Harvey Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby, it was no
longer possible to arrive at the complete story of the assassination
through normal judicial procedures during a trial of the alleged
assassin. Alternative means for instituting a complete investigation
were widely discussed. Federal and State officials conferred
on the possibility of initiating a court of inquiry before a State
magistrate in Texas. An investigation by the grand jury of Dallas
County also was considered. As speculation about the existence of a
foreign or domestic conspiracy became widespread, committees in both
Houses of Congress weighed the desirability of congressional hearings
to discover all the facts relating to the assassination.</p>

<p>By his order of November 29 establishing the Commission, President
Johnson sought to avoid parallel investigations and to concentrate
factfinding in a body having the broadest national mandate.
As Chairman of the Commission, President Johnson selected Earl
Warren, Chief Justice of the United States, former Governor and attorney
general of the State of California. From the U.S. Senate, he
chose Richard B. Russell, Democratic Senator from Georgia and
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, former Governor
of, and county attorney in, the State of Georgia, and John Sherman
Cooper, Republican Senator from Kentucky, former county and circuit
judge, State of Kentucky, and U.S. Ambassador to India. Two
members of the Commission were drawn from the U.S. House of Representatives:
Hale Boggs, Democratic U.S. Representative from Louisiana
and majority whip, and Gerald R. Ford, Republican, U.S.
Representative from Michigan and chairman of the House Republican
Conference. From private life, President Johnson selected two
lawyers by profession, both of whom have served in the administrations
of Democratic and Republican Presidents: Allen W. Dulles,
former Director of Central Intelligence, and John J. McCloy, former
President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
former U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, and during
World War II, the Assistant Secretary of War.</p>

<p>From its first meeting on December 5, 1963, the Commission viewed
the Executive order as an unequivocal Presidential mandate to conduct
a thorough and independent investigation. Because of the numerous
rumors and theories, the Commission concluded that the public interest
in insuring that the truth was ascertained could not be met by merely
accepting the reports or the analyses of Federal or State agencies. Not
only were the premises and conclusions of those reports critically reassessed,
but all assertions or rumors relating to a possible conspiracy,
or the complicity of others than Oswald, which have come to the attention
of the Commission, were investigated.</p>

<p>On December 13, 1963, Congress enacted Senate Joint Resolution
137 (Public Law 88-202)<a id="FNanchor_F-3" href="#Footnote_F-3" class="fnanchor">F-3</a> empowering the Commission to issue subpoenas
requiring the testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence
relating to any matter under its investigation. In addition, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
resolution authorized the Commission to compel testimony from witnesses
claiming the privilege against self-incrimination under the fifth
amendment to the U.S. Constitution by providing for the grant of
immunity to persons testifying under such compulsion. Immunity
under these provisions was not granted to any witness during the
Commission’s investigation.</p>

<p>The Commission took steps immediately to obtain the necessary
staff to fulfill its assignment. J. Lee Rankin, former Solicitor General
of the United States, was sworn in as general counsel for the
Commission on December 16, 1963. Additional members of the legal
staff were selected during the next few weeks. The Commission has
been aided by 14 assistant counsel with high professional qualifications,
selected by it from widely separated parts of the United States. This
staff undertook the work of the Commission with a wealth of legal
and investigative experience and a total dedication to the determination
of the truth. The Commission has been assisted also by highly
qualified personnel from several Federal agencies, assigned to the
Commission at its request. This group included lawyers from
the Department of Justice, agents of the Internal Revenue Service,
a senior historian from the Department of Defense, an editor from
the Department of State, and secretarial and administrative staff
supplied by the General Services Administration and other agencies.</p>

<p>In addition to the assistance afforded by Federal agencies, the Commission
throughout its inquiry had the cooperation of representatives
of the city of Dallas and the State of Texas. The attorney general of
Texas, Waggoner Carr, aided by two distinguished lawyers of that
State, Robert G. Storey of Dallas, retired dean of the Southern
Methodist University Law School and former president of the American
Bar Association, and Leon Jaworski of Houston, former president
of the Texas State Bar Association, has been fully informed at
all times as to the progress of the investigation, and has advanced
such suggestions as he and his special assistants considered helpful to
the accomplishment of the Commission’s assignment. Attorney General
Carr has promptly supplied the Commission with pertinent information
possessed by Texas officials. Dallas officials, particularly those
from the police department, have fully complied with all requests
made by the Commission.</p>

<h3>THE INVESTIGATION</h3>

<p>During December and early January the Commission received an
increasing volume of reports from Federal and State investigative
agencies. Of principal importance was the five-volume report of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, submitted on December 9, 1963,
which summarized the results of the investigation conducted by the
Bureau immediately after the assassination. After reviewing this
report, the Commission requested the Federal Bureau of Investigation
to furnish the underlying investigative materials relied upon in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
summary report. The first investigative reports submitted in response
to this request were delivered to the Commission on December
20, 1963. On December 18, the Secret Service submitted a detailed
report on security precautions taken before President Kennedy’s trip
to Texas and a summary of the events of November 22, as witnessed
by Secret Service agents. A few days later the Department of State
submitted a report relating to Oswald’s defection to the Soviet Union
in 1959, and his return to the United States in 1962. On January 7
and 11, 1964, the attorney general of Texas submitted an extensive
set of investigative materials, largely Dallas police reports, on the
assassination of President Kennedy and the killing of Oswald.</p>

<p>As these investigative reports were received, the staff began analyzing
and summarizing them. The members of the legal staff, divided
into teams, proceeded to organize the facts revealed by these investigations,
determine the issues, sort out the unresolved problems, and
recommend additional investigation by the Commission. Simultaneously,
to insure that no relevant information would be overlooked,
the Commission directed requests to the 10 major departments of the
Federal Government, 14 of its independent agencies or commissions,
and 4 congressional committees for all information relating to the
assassination or the background and activities of Lee Harvey Oswald
and Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>After reviewing the accumulating materials, the Commission directed
numerous additional requests to Federal and State investigative
agencies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret
Service executed the detailed requests for statements of witnesses
and examinations of physical evidence with dispatch and thoroughness.
All these reports were reviewed and analyzed by the Commission.
Additional investigative requests, where appropriate, were
handled by Internal Revenue Service, Department of State, and the
military intelligence agencies with comparable skill. Investigative
analyses of particular significance and sensitivity in the foreign areas
were contributed by the Central Intelligence Agency. On occasion
the Commission used independent experts from State and city governments
to supplement or verify information. During the investigation
the Commission on several occasions visited the scene of the assassination
and other places in the Dallas area pertinent to the inquiry.</p>

<p>The scope and detail of the investigative effort by the Federal and
State agencies are suggested in part by statistics from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service. Immediately after
the assassination more than 80 additional FBI personnel were transferred
to the Dallas office on a temporary basis to assist in the investigation.
Beginning November 22, 1963, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation conducted approximately 25,000 interviews and reinterviews
of persons having information of possible relevance to the investigation
and by September 11, 1964, submitted over 2,300 reports
totaling approximately 25,400 pages to the Commission. During the
same period the Secret Service conducted approximately 1,550 interviews
and submitted 800 reports totaling some 4,600 pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
Because of the diligence, cooperation, and facilities of Federal investigative
agencies, it was unnecessary for the Commission to employ
investigators other than the members of the Commission’s legal staff.
The Commission recognized, however, that special measures were required
whenever the facts or rumors called for an appraisal of the acts
of the agencies themselves. The staff reviewed in detail the actions of
several Federal agencies, particularly the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
the Secret Service, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the
Department of State. Initially the Commission requested the agencies
to furnish all their reports relating to the assassination and their relationships
with Oswald or Ruby. On the basis of these reports, the
Commission submitted specific questions to the agency involved.
Members of the staff followed up the answers by reviewing the relevant
files of each agency for additional information. In some instances,
members of the Commission also reviewed the files in person. Finally,
the responsible officials of these agencies were called to testify under
oath. Dean Rusk, Secretary of State; C. Douglas Dillon, Secretary
of the Treasury; John A. McCone, Director of the Central Intelligence
Agency; J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation;
and James J. Rowley, Chief of the Secret Service, appeared
as witnesses and testified fully regarding their agencies’ participation
in the matters under scrutiny by the Commission.</p>

<h3>COMMISSION HEARINGS</h3>

<p>In addition to the information resulting from these investigations,
the Commission has relied primarily on the facts disclosed by the
sworn testimony of the principal witnesses to the assassination and
related events. Beginning on February 3, 1964, the Commission and
its staff has taken the testimony of 552 witnesses. Of this number,
94 appeared before members of the Commission; 395 were questioned
by members of the Commission’s legal staff; 61 supplied sworn affidavits;
and 2 gave statements.<a id="FNanchor_F-4" href="#Footnote_F-4" class="fnanchor">F-4</a> Under Commission procedures, all
witnesses were advised that they had the right to the presence and the
advice of their lawyer during the interrogation, with the corollary
rights to raise objections to any questions asked, to make any clarifying
statement on the record after the interrogation, and to purchase a copy
of their testimony.<a id="FNanchor_F-5" href="#Footnote_F-5" class="fnanchor">F-5</a></p>

<p>Commission hearings were closed to the public unless the witness
appearing before the Commission requested an open hearing. Under
these procedures, testimony of one witness was taken in a public hearing
on two occasions. No other witness requested a public hearing.
The Commission concluded that the premature publication by it of
testimony regarding the assassination or the subsequent killing of
Oswald might interfere with Ruby’s rights to a fair and impartial
trial on the charges filed against him by the State of Texas. The
Commission also recognized that testimony would be presented before
it which would be inadmissible in judicial proceedings and might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
prejudice innocent parties if made public out of context. In addition
to the witnesses who appeared before the Commission, numerous
others provided sworn depositions, affidavits, and statements upon
which the Commission has relied. Since this testimony, as well as
that taken before the Commission, could not always be taken in logical
sequence, the Commission concluded that partial publication of testimony
as the investigation progressed was impractical and could be
misleading.</p>

<h3>THE COMMISSION’S FUNCTION</h3>

<p>The Commission’s most difficult assignments have been to uncover
all the facts concerning the assassination of President Kennedy and
to determine if it was in any way directed or encouraged by unknown
persons at home or abroad. In this process, its objective has been to
identify the person or persons responsible for both the assassination
of President Kennedy and the killing of Oswald through an examination
of the evidence. The task has demanded unceasing appraisal of
the evidence by the individual members of the Commission in their
effort to discover the whole truth.</p>

<p>The procedures followed by the Commission in developing and
assessing evidence necessarily differed from those of a court conducting
a criminal trial of a defendant present before it, since under our
system there is no provision for a posthumous trial. If Oswald had
lived he could have had a trial by American standards of justice where
he would have been able to exercise his full rights under the law.
A judge and jury would have presumed him innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. He might have furnished information
which could have affected the course of his trial. He could
have participated in and guided his defense. There could have been
an examination to determine whether he was sane under prevailing
legal standards. All witnesses, including possibly the defendant,
could have been subjected to searching examination under the adversary
system of American trials.</p>

<p>The Commission has functioned neither as a court presiding over
an adversary proceeding nor as a prosecutor determined to prove a
case, but as a factfinding agency committed to the ascertainment of
the truth. In the course of the investigation of the facts and rumors
surrounding these matters, it was necessary to explore hearsay and
other sources of information not admissible in a court proceeding
obtained from persons who saw or heard and others in a position to
observe what occurred. In fairness to the alleged assassin and his
family, the Commission on February 25, 1964, requested Walter E.
Craig, president of the American Bar Association, to participate in
the investigation and to advise the Commission whether in his opinion
the proceedings conformed to the basic principles of American justice.
Mr. Craig accepted this assignment and participated fully and without
limitation. He attended Commission hearings in person or
through his appointed assistants. All working papers, reports, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
other data in Commission files were made available, and Mr. Craig
and his associates were given the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses,
to recall any witness heard prior to his appointment, and to
suggest witnesses whose testimony they would like to have the Commission
hear. This procedure was agreeable to counsel for Oswald’s
widow.</p>

<h3>THE COMMISSION’S REPORT</h3>

<p>In this report the Commission submits the results of its investigation.
Each member of the Commission has given careful consideration
to the entire report and concurs in its findings and conclusions.
The report consists of an initial chapter summarizing the Commission’s
basic findings and conclusions, followed by a detailed analysis
of the facts and the issues raised by the events of November 22, 1963,
and the 2 following days. Individual chapters consider the trip to
Dallas, the shots from the Texas School Book Depository, the identity
of the assassin, the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald, the possibility of a
conspiracy, Oswald’s background and possible motive, and arrangements
for the protection of the President. In these chapters, rather
than rely on cross references, the Commission on occasion has repeated
certain testimony in order that the reader might have the necessary
information before him while examining the conclusions of the Commission
on each important issue.</p>

<p>With this report the Commission is submitting the complete testimony
of all the witnesses who appeared before the Commission or
gave sworn depositions or affidavits, the accompanying documentary
exhibits, and other investigative materials which are relied upon
in this report. The Commission is committing all of its reports and
working papers to the National Archives, where they can be permanently
preserved under the rules and regulations of the National
Archives and applicable Federal law.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The assassination</span> of John Fitzgerald Kennedy on
November 22, 1963, was a cruel and shocking act of violence
directed against a man, a family, a nation, and against all
mankind. A young and vigorous leader whose years of public and
private life stretched before him was the victim of the fourth Presidential
assassination in the history of a country dedicated to the concepts
of reasoned argument and peaceful political change. This
Commission was created on November 29, 1963, in recognition of the
right of people everywhere to full and truthful knowledge concerning
these events. This report endeavors to fulfill that right and to
appraise this tragedy by the light of reason and the standard of fairness.
It has been prepared with a deep awareness of the Commission’s
responsibility to present to the American people an objective report
of the facts relating to the assassination.</p>

<h3 id="hdr4">NARRATIVE OF EVENTS</h3>

<p>At 11:40 a.m., c.s.t., on Friday, November 22, 1963, President John F.
Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy, and their party arrived at Love Field, Dallas,
Tex. Behind them was the first day of a Texas trip planned 5 months
before by the President, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, and
John B. Connally, Jr., Governor of Texas. After leaving the White
House on Thursday morning, the President had flown initially to San
Antonio where Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson joined the party
and the President dedicated new research facilities at the U.S. Air
Force School of Aerospace Medicine. Following a testimonial dinner
in Houston for U.S. Representative Albert Thomas, the President flew
to Fort Worth where he spent the night and spoke at a large breakfast
gathering on Friday.</p>

<p>Planned for later that day were a motorcade through downtown
Dallas, a luncheon speech at the Trade Mart, and a flight to Austin
where the President would attend a reception and speak at a Democratic
fundraising dinner. From Austin he would proceed to the
Texas ranch of the Vice President. Evident on this trip were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
varied roles which an American President performs—Head of State,
Chief Executive, party leader, and, in this instance, prospective candidate
for reelection.</p>

<p>The Dallas motorcade, it was hoped, would evoke a demonstration
of the President’s personal popularity in a city which he had lost in
the 1960 election. Once it had been decided that the trip to Texas
would span 2 days, those responsible for planning, primarily Governor
Connally and Kenneth O’Donnell, a special assistant to the President,
agreed that a motorcade through Dallas would be desirable.
The Secret Service was told on November 8 that 45 minutes had been
allotted to a motorcade procession from Love Field to the site of a
luncheon planned by Dallas business and civic leaders in honor of the
President. After considering the facilities and security problems of
several buildings, the Trade Mart was chosen as the luncheon site.
Given this selection, and in accordance with the customary practice
of affording the greatest number of people an opportunity to see the
President, the motorcade route selected was a natural one. The route
was approved by the local host committee and White House representatives
on November 18 and publicized in the local papers starting on
November 19. This advance publicity made it clear that the motorcade
would leave Main Street and pass the intersection of Elm and
Houston Streets as it proceeded to the Trade Mart by way of the
Stemmons Freeway.</p>

<p>By midmorning of November 22, clearing skies in Dallas dispelled
the threat of rain and the President greeted the crowds from his open
limousine without the “bubbletop,” which was at that time a plastic
shield furnishing protection only against inclement weather. To the
left of the President in the rear seat was Mrs. Kennedy. In the
jump seats were Governor Connally, who was in front of the President,
and Mrs. Connally at the Governor’s left. Agent William R. Greer
of the Secret Service was driving, and Agent Roy H. Kellerman was
sitting to his right.</p>

<p>Directly behind the Presidential limousine was an open “followup”
car with eight Secret Service agents, two in the front seat, two in the
rear, and two on each running board. These agents, in accordance with
normal Secret Service procedures, were instructed to scan the crowds,
the roofs, and windows of buildings, overpasses, and crossings for signs
of trouble. Behind the “followup” car was the Vice-Presidential car
carrying the Vice President and Mrs. Johnson and Senator Ralph W.
Yarborough. Next were a Vice-Presidential “followup” car and several
cars and buses for additional dignitaries, press representatives,
and others.</p>

<p>The motorcade left Love Field shortly after 11:50 a.m., and proceeded
through residential neighborhoods, stopping twice at the
President’s request to greet well-wishers among the friendly crowds.
Each time the President’s car halted, Secret Service agents from the
“followup” car moved forward to assume a protective stance near the
President and Mrs. Kennedy. As the motorcade reached Main Street,
a principal east-west artery in downtown Dallas, the welcome became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
tumultuous. At the extreme west end of Main Street the motorcade
turned right on Houston Street and proceeded north for one block in
order to make a left turn on Elm Street, the most direct and convenient
approach to the Stemmons Freeway and the Trade Mart. As the
President’s car approached the intersection of Houston and Elm
Streets, there loomed directly ahead on the intersection’s northwest corner
a seven-story, orange brick warehouse and office building, the Texas
School Book Depository. Riding in the Vice President’s car, Agent
Rufus W. Youngblood of the Secret Service noticed that the clock atop
the building indicated 12:30 p.m., the scheduled arrival time at the
Trade Mart.</p>

<p>The President’s car which had been going north made a sharp turn
toward the southwest onto Elm Street. At a speed of about 11 miles
per hour, it started down the gradual descent toward a railroad overpass
under which the motorcade would proceed before reaching the
Stemmons Freeway. The front of the Texas School Book Depository
was now on the President’s right, and he waved to the crowd assembled
there as he passed the building. Dealey Plaza—an open,
landscaped area marking the western end of downtown Dallas—stretched
out to the President’s left. A Secret Service agent riding
in the motorcade radioed the Trade Mart that the President would
arrive in 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Seconds later shots resounded in rapid succession. The President’s
hands moved to his neck. He appeared to stiffen momentarily and
lurch slightly forward in his seat. A bullet had entered the base
of the back of his neck slightly to the right of the spine. It traveled
downward and exited from the front of the neck, causing a
nick in the left lower portion of the knot in the President’s necktie.
Before the shooting started, Governor Connally had been facing
toward the crowd on the right. He started to turn toward the left
and suddenly felt a blow on his back. The Governor had been hit
by a bullet which entered at the extreme right side of his back at a
point below his right armpit. The bullet traveled through his chest
in a downward and forward direction, exited below his right nipple,
passed through his right wrist which had been in his lap, and then
caused a wound to his left thigh. The force of the bullet’s impact
appeared to spin the Governor to his right, and Mrs. Connally pulled
him down into her lap. Another bullet then struck President Kennedy
in the rear portion of his head, causing a massive and fatal wound.
The President fell to the left into Mrs. Kennedy’s lap.</p>

<p>Secret Service Agent Clinton J. Hill, riding on the left running
board of the “followup” car, heard a noise which sounded like a firecracker
and saw the President suddenly lean forward and to the left.
Hill jumped off the car and raced toward the President’s limousine.
In the front seat of the Vice-Presidential car, Agent Youngblood
heard an explosion and noticed unusual movements in the crowd.
He vaulted into the rear seat and sat on the Vice President in order
to protect him. At the same time Agent Kellerman in the front seat
of the Presidential limousine turned to observe the President. Seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
that the President was struck, Kellerman instructed the driver,
“Let’s get out of here; we are hit.” He radioed ahead to the lead car,
“Get us to the hospital immediately.” Agent Greer immediately accelerated
the Presidential car. As it gained speed, Agent Hill managed
to pull himself onto the back of the car where Mrs. Kennedy had
climbed. Hill pushed her back into the rear seat and shielded the
stricken President and Mrs. Kennedy as the President’s car proceeded
at high speed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, 4 miles away.</p>

<p>At Parkland, the President was immediately treated by a team of
physicians who had been alerted for the President’s arrival by the
Dallas Police Department as the result of a radio message from the
motorcade after the shooting. The doctors noted irregular breathing
movements and a possible heartbeat, although they could not detect a
pulsebeat. They observed the extensive wound in the President’s
head and a small wound approximately one-fourth inch in diameter in
the lower third of his neck. In an effort to facilitate breathing, the
physicians performed a tracheotomy by enlarging the throat wound
and inserting a tube. Totally absorbed in the immediate task of trying
to preserve the President’s life, the attending doctors never turned
the President over for an examination of his back. At 1 p.m., after all
heart activity ceased and the Last Rites were administered by a priest,
President Kennedy was pronounced dead. Governor Connally underwent
surgery and ultimately recovered from his serious wounds.</p>

<p>Upon learning of the President’s death, Vice President Johnson left
Parkland Hospital under close guard and proceeded to the Presidential
plane at Love Field. Mrs. Kennedy, accompanying her husband’s
body, boarded the plane shortly thereafter. At 2:38 p.m., in the
central compartment of the plane, Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as
the 36th President of the United States by Federal District Court
Judge Sarah T. Hughes. The plane left immediately for Washington,
D.C., arriving at Andrews AFB, Md., at 5:58 p.m., e.s.t. The President’s
body was taken to the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda,
Md., where it was given a complete pathological examination. The
autopsy disclosed the large head wound observed at Parkland and the
wound in the front of the neck which had been enlarged by the Parkland
doctors when they performed the tracheotomy. Both of these
wounds were described in the autopsy report as being “presumably of
exit.” In addition the autopsy revealed a small wound of entry in
the rear of the President’s skull and another wound of entry near the
base of the back of the neck. The autopsy report stated the cause of
death as “Gunshot wound, head,” and the bullets which struck the
President were described as having been fired “from a point behind
and somewhat above the level of the deceased.”</p>

<p>At the scene of the shooting, there was evident confusion at the outset
concerning the point of origin of the shots. Witnesses differed in
their accounts of the direction from which the sound of the shots emanated.
Within a few minutes, however, attention centered on the
Texas School Book Depository Building as the source of the shots.
The building was occupied by a private corporation, the Texas School<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
Book Depository Co., which distributed school textbooks of several
publishers and leased space to representatives of the publishers. Most
of the employees in the building worked for these publishers. The
balance, including a 15-man warehousing crew, were employees of the
Texas School Book Depository Co. itself.</p>

<p>Several eyewitnesses in front of the building reported that they saw
a rifle being fired from the southeast corner window on the sixth floor
of the Texas School Book Depository. One eyewitness, Howard L.
Brennan, had been watching the parade from a point on Elm Street
directly opposite and facing the building. He promptly told a
policeman that he had seen a slender man, about 5 feet 10 inches, in his
early thirties, take deliberate aim from the sixth-floor corner window
and fire a rifle in the direction of the President’s car. Brennan thought
he might be able to identify the man since he had noticed him in the
window a few minutes before the motorcade made the turn onto Elm
Street. At 12:34 p.m., the Dallas police radio mentioned the Depository
Building as a possible source of the shots, and at 12:45 p.m., the
police radio broadcast a description of the suspected assassin based
primarily on Brennan’s observations.</p>

<p>When the shots were fired, a Dallas motorcycle patrolman, Marrion
L. Baker, was riding in the motorcade at a point several cars behind
the President. He had turned right from Main Street onto Houston
Street and was about 200 feet south of Elm Street when he heard a
shot. Baker, having recently returned from a week of deer hunting,
was certain the shot came from a high-powered rifle. He looked up
and saw pigeons scattering in the air from their perches on the Texas
School Book Depository Building. He raced his motorcycle to the
building, dismounted, scanned the area to the west and pushed his way
through the spectators toward the entrance. There he encountered
Roy Truly, the building superintendent, who offered Baker his
help. They entered the building, and ran toward the two elevators in
the rear. Finding that both elevators were on an upper floor, they
dashed up the stairs. Not more than 2 minutes had elapsed since the
shooting.</p>

<p>When they reached the second-floor landing on their way up to
the top of the building, Patrolman Baker thought he caught a glimpse
of someone through the small glass window in the door separating the
hall area near the stairs from the small vestibule leading into the
lunchroom. Gun in hand, he rushed to the door and saw a man about
20 feet away walking toward the other end of the lunchroom. The
man was emptyhanded. At Baker’s command, the man turned and
approached him. Truly, who had started up the stairs to the third
floor ahead of Baker, returned to see what had delayed the patrolman.
Baker asked Truly whether he knew the man in the lunchroom.
Truly replied that the man worked in the building, whereupon Baker
turned from the man and proceeded, with Truly, up the stairs. The
man they encountered had started working in the Texas School Book
Depository Building on October 16, 1963. His fellow workers described<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
him as very quiet—a “loner.” His name was Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>Within about 1 minute after his encounter with Baker and Truly,
Oswald was seen passing through the second-floor offices. In his hand
was a full “Coke” bottle which he had purchased from a vending machine
in the lunchroom. He was walking toward the front of the
building where a passenger elevator and a short flight of stairs provided
access to the main entrance of the building on the first floor.
Approximately 7 minutes later, at about 12:40 p.m., Oswald boarded a
bus at a point on Elm Street seven short blocks east of the Depository
Building. The bus was traveling west toward the very building from
which Oswald had come. Its route lay through the Oak Cliff section
in southwest Dallas, where it would pass seven blocks east of the roominghouse
in which Oswald was living, at 1026 North Beckley Avenue.
On the bus was Mrs. Mary Bledsoe, one of Oswald’s former landladies
who immediately recognized him. Oswald stayed on the bus approximately
3 or 4 minutes, during which time it proceeded only two blocks
because of the traffic jam created by the motorcade and the assassination.
Oswald then left the bus.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he entered a vacant taxi four blocks away and
asked the driver to take him to a point on North Beckley Avenue
several blocks beyond his roominghouse. The trip required 5 or 6
minutes. At about 1 p.m. Oswald arrived at the roominghouse. The
housekeeper, Mrs. Earlene Roberts, was surprised to see Oswald at
midday and remarked to him that he seemed to be in quite a hurry. He
made no reply. A few minutes later Oswald emerged from his room
zipping up his jacket and rushed out of the house.</p>

<p>Approximately 14 minutes later, and just 45 minutes after the
assassination, another violent shooting occurred in Dallas. The victim
was Patrolman J. D. Tippit of the Dallas police, an officer with a
good record during his more than 11 years with the police force.
He was shot near the intersection of 10th Street and Patton Avenue,
about nine-tenths of a mile from Oswald’s roominghouse. At the time
of the assassination, Tippit was alone in his patrol car, the routine
practice for most police patrol cars at this time of day. He
had been ordered by radio at 12:45 p.m. to proceed to the central
Oak Cliff area as part of a concentration of patrol car activity around
the center of the city following the assassination. At 12:54 Tippit
radioed that he had moved as directed and would be available for
any emergency. By this time the police radio had broadcast several
messages alerting the police to the suspect described by Brennan at
the scene of the assassination—a slender white male, about 30 years
old, 5 feet 10 inches and weighing about 165 pounds.</p>

<p>At approximately 1:15 p.m., Tippit was driving slowly in an easterly
direction on East 10th Street in Oak Cliff. About 100 feet past the
intersection of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, Tippit pulled up alongside
a man walking in the same direction. The man met the general
description of the suspect wanted in connection with the assassination.
He walked over to Tippit’s car, rested his arms on the door on the right-hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
side of the car, and apparently exchanged words with Tippit
through the window. Tippit opened the door on the left side and
started to walk around the front of his car. As he reached the front
wheel on the driver’s side, the man on the sidewalk drew a revolver and
fired several shots in rapid succession, hitting Tippit four times and
killing him instantly. An automobile repairman, Domingo Benavides,
heard the shots and stopped his pickup truck on the opposite side of the
street about 25 feet in front of Tippit’s car. He observed the gunman
start back toward Patton Avenue, removing the empty cartridge cases
from the gun as he went. Benavides rushed to Tippit’s side. The patrolman,
apparently dead, was lying on his revolver, which was out of
its holster. Benavides promptly reported the shooting to police headquarters
over the radio in Tippit’s car. The message was received
shortly after 1:16 p.m.</p>

<p>As the gunman left the scene, he walked hurriedly back toward Patton
Avenue and turned left, heading south. Standing on the northwest
corner of 10th Street and Patton Avenue was Helen Markham,
who had been walking south on Patton Avenue and had seen both the
killer and Tippit cross the intersection in front of her as she waited on
the curb for traffic to pass. She witnessed the shooting and then saw
the man with a gun in his hand walk back toward the corner and cut
across the lawn of the corner house as he started south on Patton
Avenue.</p>

<p>In the corner house itself, Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis and her sister-in-law,
Mrs. Virginia Davis, heard the shots and rushed to the
door in time to see the man walk rapidly across the lawn shaking a
revolver as if he were emptying it of cartridge cases. Later that day
each woman found a cartridge case near the house. As the gunman
turned the corner he passed alongside a taxicab which was parked on
Patton Avenue, a few feet from 10th Street. The driver, William W.
Scoggins, had seen the slaying and was now crouched behind his cab
on the street side. As the gunman cut through the shrubbery on the
lawn, Scoggins looked up and saw the man approximately 12 feet
away. In his hand was a pistol and he muttered words which sounded
to Scoggins like “poor dumb cop” or “poor damn cop.”</p>

<p>After passing Scoggins, the gunman crossed to the west side of Patton
Avenue and ran south toward Jefferson Boulevard, a main Oak
Cliff thoroughfare. On the east side of Patton, between 10th Street
and Jefferson Boulevard, Ted Callaway, a used car salesman, heard
the shots and ran to the sidewalk. As the man with the gun rushed
past, Callaway shouted “What’s going on?” The man merely
shrugged, ran on to Jefferson Boulevard and turned right. On the next
corner was a gas station with a parking lot in the rear. The assailant
ran into the lot, discarded his jacket and then continued his flight west
on Jefferson.</p>

<p>In a shoe store a few blocks farther west on Jefferson, the manager,
Johnny Calvin Brewer, heard the siren of a police car moments after
the radio in his store announced the shooting of the police officer in Oak
Cliff. Brewer saw a man step quickly into the entranceway of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
store and stand there with his back toward the street. When the police
car made a <b class="sans">U</b>-turn and headed back in the direction of the Tippit
shooting, the man left and Brewer followed him. He saw the man
enter the Texas Theatre, a motion picture house about 60 feet away,
without buying a ticket. Brewer pointed this out to the cashier, Mrs.
Julia Postal, who called the police. The time was shortly after
1:40 p.m.</p>

<p>At 1:29 p.m., the police radio had noted the similarity in the descriptions
of the suspects in the Tippit shooting and the assassination. At
1:45 p.m., in response to Mrs. Postal’s call, the police radio sounded the
alarm: “Have information a suspect just went in the Texas Theatre
on West Jefferson.” Within minutes the theater was surrounded.
The house lights were then turned up. Patrolman M. N. McDonald
and several other policemen approached the man, who had been
pointed out to them by Brewer.</p>

<p>McDonald ordered the man to his feet and heard him say, “Well,
it’s all over now.” The man drew a gun from his waist with one
hand and struck the officer with the other. McDonald struck out
with his right hand and grabbed the gun with his left hand. After
a brief struggle McDonald and several other police officers disarmed
and handcuffed the suspect and drove him to police headquarters,
arriving at approximately 2 p.m.</p>

<p>Following the assassination, police cars had rushed to the Texas
School Book Depository in response to the many radio messages reporting
that the shots had been fired from the Depository Building.
Inspector J. Herbert Sawyer of the Dallas Police Department arrived
at the scene shortly after hearing the first of these police radio messages
at 12:34 p.m. Some of the officers who had been assigned to
the area of Elm and Houston Streets for the motorcade were talking
to witnesses and watching the building when Sawyer arrived. Sawyer
entered the building and rode a passenger elevator to the fourth floor,
which was the top floor for this elevator. He conducted a quick
search, returned to the main floor and, between approximately 12:37
and 12:40 p.m., ordered that no one be permitted to leave the building.</p>

<p>Shortly before 1 p.m. Capt. J. Will Fritz, chief of the homicide
and robbery bureau of the Dallas Police Department, arrived to take
charge of the investigation. Searching the sixth floor, Deputy Sheriff
Luke Mooney noticed a pile of cartons in the southeast corner. He
squeezed through the boxes and realized immediately that he had
discovered the point from which the shots had been fired. On the floor
were three empty cartridge cases. A carton had apparently been
placed on the floor at the side of the window so that a person sitting on
the carton could look down Elm Street toward the overpass and
scarcely be noticed from the outside. Between this carton and the
half-open window were three additional cartons arranged at such an
angle that a rifle resting on the top carton would be aimed directly at
the motorcade as it moved away from the building. The high stack
of boxes, which first attracted Mooney’s attention, effectively screened
a person at the window from the view of anyone else on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Mooney’s discovery intensified the search for additional evidence
on the sixth floor, and at 1:22 p.m., approximately 10 minutes after
the cartridge cases were found, Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone turned
his flashlight in the direction of two rows of boxes in the northwest
corner near the staircase. Stuffed between the two rows was a bolt-action
rifle with a telescopic sight. The rifle was not touched until
it could be photographed. When Lt. J. C. Day of the police identification
bureau decided that the wooden stock and the metal knob
at the end of the bolt contained no prints, he held the rifle by the
stock while Captain Fritz ejected a live shell by operating the bolt.
Lieutenant Day promptly noted that stamped on the rifle itself was
the serial number “C2766” as well as the markings “1940” “MADE
ITALY” and “CAL. 6.5.” The rifle was about 40 inches long and when
disassembled it could fit into a handmade paper sack which, after the
assassination, was found in the southeast corner of the building within
a few feet of the cartridge cases.</p>

<p>As Fritz and Day were completing their examination of this rifle
on the sixth floor, Roy Truly, the building superintendent, approached
with information which he felt should be brought to the attention of
the police. Earlier, while the police were questioning the employees,
Truly had observed that Lee Harvey Oswald, 1 of the 15 men who
worked in the warehouse, was missing. After Truly provided Oswald’s
name, address, and general description, Fritz left for police headquarters.
He arrived at headquarters shortly after 2 p.m. and asked two detectives
to pick up the employee who was missing from the Texas
School Book Depository. Standing nearby were the police officers who
had just arrived with the man arrested in the Texas Theatre. When
Fritz mentioned the name of the missing employee, he learned that the
man was already in the interrogation room. The missing School Book
Depository employee and the suspect who had been apprehended in
the Texas Theatre were one and the same—Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>The suspect Fritz was about to question in connection with the
assassination of the President and the murder of a policeman was
born in New Orleans on October 18, 1939, 2 months after the death
of his father. His mother, Marguerite Claverie Oswald, had two older
children. One, John Pic, was a half-brother to Lee from an earlier
marriage which had ended in divorce. The other was Robert Oswald,
a full brother to Lee and 5 years older. When Lee Oswald was 3,
Mrs. Oswald placed him in an orphanage where his brother and half-brother
were already living, primarily because she had to work.</p>

<p>In January 1944, when Lee was 4, he was taken out of the orphanage,
and shortly thereafter his mother moved with him to Dallas, Tex.,
where the older boys joined them at the end of the school year. In May
of 1945 Marguerite Oswald married her third husband, Edwin A. Ekdahl.
While the two older boys attended a military boarding school,
Lee lived at home and developed a warm attachment to Ekdahl, occasionally
accompanying his mother and stepfather on business trips
around the country. Lee started school in Benbrook, Tex., but in
the fall of 1946, after a separation from Ekdahl, Marguerite Oswald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
reentered Lee in the first grade in Covington, La. In January 1947,
while Lee was still in the first grade, the family moved to Fort
Worth, Tex., as the result of an attempted reconciliation between
Ekdahl and Lee’s mother. A year and a half later, before Lee was
9, his mother was divorced from her third husband as the result of
a divorce action instituted by Ekdahl. Lee’s school record during
the next 5½ years in Fort Worth was average, although generally
it grew poorer each year. The comments of teachers and others who
knew him at that time do not reveal any unusual personality
traits or characteristics.</p>

<p>Another change for Lee Oswald occurred in August 1952, a few
months after he completed the sixth grade. Marguerite Oswald and
her 12-year-old son moved to New York City where Marguerite’s oldest
son, John Pic, was stationed with the Coast Guard. The ensuing
year and one-half in New York was marked by Lee’s refusals to
attend school and by emotional and psychological problems of a
seemingly serious nature. Because he had become a chronic school
truant, Lee underwent psychiatric study at Youth House, an institution
in New York for juveniles who have had truancy problems or
difficulties with the law, and who appear to require psychiatric observation,
or other types of guidance. The social worker assigned to
his case described him as “seriously detached” and “withdrawn” and
noted “a rather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally
starved, affectionless youngster.” Lee expressed the feeling to the
social worker that his mother did not care for him and regarded him
as a burden. He experienced fantasies about being all powerful and
hurting people, but during his stay at Youth House he was apparently
not a behavior problem. He appeared withdrawn and evasive, a boy
who preferred to spend his time alone, reading and watching television.
His tests indicated that he was above average in intelligence
for his age group. The chief psychiatrist of Youth House diagnosed
Lee’s problem as a “personality pattern disturbance with schizoid
features and passive-aggressive tendencies.” He concluded that
the boy was “an emotionally, quite disturbed youngster” and recommended
psychiatric treatment.</p>

<p>In May 1953, after having been at Youth House for 3 weeks, Lee
Oswald returned to school where his attendance and grades temporarily
improved. By the following fall, however, the probation officer
reported that virtually every teacher complained about the boy’s behavior.
His mother insisted that he did not need psychiatric assistance.
Although there was apparently some improvement in Lee’s
behavior during the next few months, the court recommended further
treatment. In January 1954, while Lee’s case was still pending,
Marguerite and Lee left for New Orleans, the city of Lee’s birth.</p>

<p>Upon his return to New Orleans, Lee maintained mediocre grades
but had no obvious behavior problems. Neighbors and others who
knew him outside of school remembered him as a quiet, solitary and introverted
boy who read a great deal and whose vocabulary made him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
quite articulate. About 1 month after he started the 10th grade and 11
days before his 16th birthday in October 1955, he brought to school a
note purportedly written by his mother, stating that the family was
moving to California. The note was written by Lee. A few days later
he dropped out of school and almost immediately tried to join the
Marine Corps. Because he was only 16, he was rejected.</p>

<p>After leaving school Lee worked for the next 10 months at several
jobs in New Orleans as an office messenger or clerk. It was during
this period that he started to read communist literature. Occasionally,
in conversations with others, he praised communism and
expressed to his fellow employees a desire to join the Communist
Party. At about this time, when he was not yet 17, he wrote to the
Socialist Party of America, professing his belief in Marxism.</p>

<p>Another move followed in July 1956 when Lee and his mother returned
to Fort Worth. He reentered high school but again dropped
out after a few weeks and enlisted in the Marine Corps on October 24,
1956, 6 days after his 17th birthday. On December 21, 1956, during
boot camp in San Diego, Oswald fired a score of 212 for record with the
M-1 rifle—2 points over the minimum for a rating of “sharpshooter”
on a marksman/sharpshooter/expert scale. After his basic training,
Oswald received training in aviation fundamentals and then in radar
scanning.</p>

<p>Most people who knew Oswald in the Marines described him as a
“loner” who resented the exercise of authority by others. He spent
much of his free time reading. He was court-martialed once for possessing
an unregistered privately owned weapon and, on another occasion,
for using provocative language to a noncommissioned officer. He
was, however, generally able to comply with Marine discipline, even
though his experiences in the Marine Corps did not live up to his
expectations.</p>

<p>Oswald served 15 months overseas until November 1958, most of
it in Japan. During his final year in the Marine Corps he was stationed
for the most part in Santa Ana, Calif., where he showed a
marked interest in the Soviet Union and sometimes expressed politically
radical views with dogmatic conviction. Oswald again fired
the M-1 rifle for record on May 6, 1959, and this time he shot a score of
191 on a shorter course than before, only 1 point over the minimum
required to be a “marksman.” According to one of his fellow marines,
Oswald was not particularly interested in his rifle performance, and
his unit was not expected to exhibit the usual rifle proficiency. During
this period he expressed strong admiration for Fidel Castro and
an interest in joining the Cuban army. He tried to impress those
around him as an intellectual, but his thinking appeared to some as
shallow and rigid.</p>

<p>Oswald’s Marine service terminated on September 11, 1959, when
at his own request he was released from active service a few months
ahead of his scheduled release. He offered as the reason for his release
the ill health and economic plight of his mother. He returned to
Fort Worth, remained with his mother only 3 days and left for New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
Orleans, telling his mother he planned to get work there in the shipping
or import-export business. In New Orleans he booked passage on the
freighter SS <i>Marion Lykes</i>, which sailed from New Orleans to Le
Havre, France, on September 20, 1959.</p>

<p>Lee Harvey Oswald had presumably planned this step in his life
for quite some time. In March of 1959 he had applied to the Albert
Schweitzer College in Switzerland for admission to the spring 1960
term. His letter of application contained many blatant falsehoods
concerning his qualifications and background. A few weeks before
his discharge he had applied for and obtained a passport, listing the
Soviet Union as one of the countries which he planned to visit. During
his service in the Marines he had saved a comparatively large sum
of money, possibly as much as $1,500, which would appear to have
been accomplished by considerable frugality and apparently for a
specific purpose.</p>

<p>The purpose of the accumulated fund soon became known. On
October 16, 1959, Oswald arrived in Moscow by train after crossing
the border from Finland, where he had secured a visa for a 6-day
stay in the Soviet Union. He immediately applied for Soviet citizenship.
On the afternoon of October 21, 1959, Oswald was ordered
to leave the Soviet Union by 8 p.m. that evening. That same afternoon
in his hotel room Oswald, in an apparent suicide attempt,
slashed his left wrist. He was hospitalized immediately. On
October 31, 3 days after his release from the hospital, Oswald
appeared at the American Embassy, announced that he wished to
renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a Russian citizen, and
handed the Embassy officer a written statement he had prepared for
the occasion. When asked his reasons, Oswald replied, “I am a
Marxist.” Oswald never formally complied with the legal steps
necessary to renounce his American citizenship. The Soviet Government
did not grant his request for citizenship, but in January 1960 he
was given permission to remain in the Soviet Union on a year-to-year
basis. At the same time Oswald was sent to Minsk where he worked
in a radio factory as an unskilled laborer. In January 1961 his permission
to remain in the Soviet Union was extended for another year.
A few weeks later, in February 1961, he wrote to the American Embassy
in Moscow expressing a desire to return to the United States.</p>

<p>The following month Oswald met a 19-year-old Russian girl, Marina
Nikolaevna Prusakova, a pharmacist, who had been brought up in
Leningrad but was then living with an aunt and uncle in Minsk.
They were married on April 30, 1961. Throughout the following
year he carried on a correspondence with American and Soviet authorities
seeking approval for the departure of himself and his wife to
the United States. In the course of this effort, Oswald and his wife
visited the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in July of 1961. Primarily on
the basis of an interview and questionnaire completed there, the
Embassy concluded that Oswald had not lost his citizenship, a
decision subsequently ratified by the Department of State in Washington,
D.C. Upon their return to Minsk, Oswald and his wife filed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
with the Soviet authorities for permission to leave together. Their
formal application was made in July 1961, and on December 25, 1961,
Marina Oswald was advised it would be granted.</p>

<p>A daughter was born to the Oswalds in February 1962. In the
months that followed they prepared for their return to the United
States. On May 9, 1962, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service, at the request of the Department of State, agreed to waive a
restriction under the law which would have prevented the issuance of
a United States visa to Oswald’s Russian wife until she had left the
Soviet Union. They finally left Moscow on June 1, 1962, and were assisted
in meeting their travel expenses by a loan of $435.71 from the
U.S. Department of State. Two weeks later they arrived in Fort
Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>For a few weeks Oswald, his wife and child lived with Oswald’s
brother Robert. After a similar stay with Oswald’s mother, they
moved into their own apartment in early August. Oswald obtained
a job on July 16 as a sheet metal worker. During this period in
Fort Worth, Oswald was interviewed twice by agents of the FBI.
The report of the first interview, which occurred on June 26, described
him as arrogant and unwilling to discuss the reasons why he had
gone to the Soviet Union. Oswald denied that he was involved in
Soviet intelligence activities and promised to advise the FBI if Soviet
representatives ever communicated with him. He was interviewed
again on August 16, when he displayed a less belligerent attitude and
once again agreed to inform the FBI of any attempt to enlist him in
intelligence activities.</p>

<p>In early October 1962 Oswald quit his job at the sheet metal plant
and moved to Dallas. While living in Forth Worth the Oswalds
had been introduced to a group of Russian-speaking people in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area. Many of them assisted the Oswalds by providing
small amounts of food, clothing, and household items. Oswald
himself was disliked by almost all of this group whose help
to the family was prompted primarily by sympathy for Marina Oswald
and the child. Despite the fact that he had left the Soviet Union,
disillusioned with its Government, Oswald seemed more firmly
committed than ever to his concepts of Marxism. He showed disdain
for democracy, capitalism, and American society in general. He was
highly critical of the Russian-speaking group because they seemed devoted
to American concepts of democracy and capitalism and were
ambitious to improve themselves economically.</p>

<p>In February 1963 the Oswalds met Ruth Paine at a social gathering.
Ruth Paine was temporarily separated from her husband and
living with her two children in their home in Irving, Tex., a suburb
of Dallas. Because of an interest in the Russian language and
sympathy for Marina Oswald, who spoke no English and had little
funds, Ruth Paine befriended Marina and, during the next 2 months,
visited her on several occasions.</p>

<p>On April 6, 1963, Oswald lost his job with a photography firm.
A few days later, on April 10, he attempted to kill Maj. Gen. Edwin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
A. Walker (Resigned, U.S. Army), using a rifle which he had ordered
by mail 1 month previously under an assumed name. Marina Oswald
learned of her husband’s act when she confronted him with a note
which he had left, giving her instructions in the event he did not
return. That incident and their general economic difficulties impelled
Marina Oswald to suggest that her husband leave Dallas and
go to New Orleans to look for work.</p>

<p>Oswald left for New Orleans on April 24, 1963. Ruth Paine, who
knew nothing of the Walker shooting, invited Marina Oswald and
the baby to stay with her in the Paines’ modest home while Oswald
sought work in New Orleans. Early in May, upon receiving word
from Oswald that he had found a job, Ruth Paine drove Marina
Oswald and the baby to New Orleans to rejoin Oswald.</p>

<p>During the stay in New Orleans, Oswald formed a fictitious New
Orleans Chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He posed
as secretary of this organization and represented that the president
was A. J. Hidell. In reality, Hidell was a completely fictitious person
created by Oswald, the organization’s only member. Oswald was
arrested on August 9 in connection with a scuffle which occurred while
he was distributing pro-Castro leaflets. The next day, while at the
police station, he was interviewed by an FBI agent after Oswald
requested the police to arrange such an interview. Oswald gave the
agent false information about his own background and was evasive
in his replies concerning Fair Play for Cuba activities. During the
next 2 weeks Oswald appeared on radio programs twice, claiming
to be the spokesman for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New
Orleans.</p>

<p>On July 19, 1963, Oswald lost his job as a greaser of coffee processing
machinery. In September, after an exchange of correspondence with
Marina Oswald, Ruth Paine drove to New Orleans and on September
23, transported Marina, the child, and the family belongings to Irving,
Tex. Ruth Paine suggested that Marina Oswald, who was expecting
her second child in October, live at the Paine house until after the
baby was born. Oswald remained behind, ostensibly to find work
either in Houston or some other city. Instead, he departed by bus for
Mexico, arriving in Mexico City on September 27, where he promptly
visited the Cuban and Russian Embassies. His stated objective was
to obtain official permission to visit Cuba, on his way to the Soviet
Union. The Cuban Government would not grant his visa unless the
Soviet Government would also issue a visa permitting his entry into
Russia. Oswald’s efforts to secure these visas failed, and he left for
Dallas, where he arrived on October 3, 1963.</p>

<p>When he saw his wife the next day, it was decided that Oswald
would rent a room in Dallas and visit his family on weekends. For
1 week he rented a room from Mrs. Bledsoe, the woman who later saw
him on the bus shortly after the assassination. On October 14, 1963,
he rented the Beckley Avenue room and listed his name as O. H. Lee.
On the same day, at the suggestion of a neighbor, Mrs. Paine phoned
the Texas School Book Depository and was told that there was a job<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
opening. She informed Oswald who was interviewed the following
day at the Depository and started to work there on October 16, 1963.</p>

<p>On October 20 the Oswalds’ second daughter was born. During October
and November Oswald established a general pattern of weekend
visits to Irving, arriving on Friday afternoon and returning to Dallas
Monday morning with a fellow employee, Buell Wesley Frazier, who
lived near the Paines. On Friday, November 15, Oswald remained in
Dallas at the suggestion of his wife who told him that the house would
be crowded because of a birthday party for Ruth Paine’s daughter.
On Monday, November 18, Oswald and his wife quarreled bitterly
during a telephone conversation, because she learned for the first time
that he was living at the roominghouse under an assumed name. On
Thursday, November 21, Oswald told Frazier that he would like to
drive to Irving to pick up some curtain rods for an apartment in
Dallas. His wife and Mrs. Paine were quite surprised to see him since
it was a Thursday night. They thought he had returned to make up
after Monday’s quarrel. He was conciliatory, but Marina Oswald was
still angry.</p>

<p>Later that evening, when Mrs. Paine had finished cleaning the
kitchen, she went into the garage and noticed that the light was burning.
She was certain that she had not left it on, although the incident
appeared unimportant at the time. In the garage were most of the
Oswalds’ personal possessions. The following morning Oswald left
while his wife was still in bed feeding the baby. She did not see him
leave the house, nor did Ruth Paine. On the dresser in their room he
left his wedding ring which he had never done before. His wallet
containing $170 was left intact in a dresser-drawer.</p>

<p>Oswald walked to Frazier’s house about half a block away and placed
a long bulky package, made out of wrapping paper and tape, into the
rear seat of the car. He told Frazier that the package contained curtain
rods. When they reached the Depository parking lot, Oswald
walked quickly ahead. Frazier followed and saw Oswald enter the
Depository Building carrying the long bulky package with him.</p>

<p>During the morning of November 22, Marina Oswald followed
President Kennedy’s activities on television. She and Ruth Paine
cried when they heard that the President had been shot. Ruth Paine
translated the news of the shooting to Marina Oswald as it came over
television, including the report that the shots were probably fired from
the building where Oswald worked. When Marina Oswald heard
this, she recalled the Walker episode and the fact that her husband
still owned the rifle. She went quietly to the Paine’s garage
where the rifle had been concealed in a blanket among their other
belongings. It appeared to her that the rifle was still there, although
she did not actually open the blanket.</p>

<p>At about 3 p.m. the police arrived at the Paine house and asked
Marina Oswald whether her husband owned a rifle. She said that he
did and then led them into the garage and pointed to the rolled up
blanket. As a police officer lifted it, the blanket hung limply over
either side of his arm. The rifle was not there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
Meanwhile, at police headquarters, Captain Fritz had begun questioning
Oswald. Soon after the start of the first interrogation, agents
of the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service arrived and participated in
the questioning. Oswald denied having anything to do with the assassination
of President Kennedy or the murder of Patrolman Tippit.
He claimed that he was eating lunch at the time of the assassination,
and that he then spoke with his foreman for 5 to 10
minutes before going home. He denied that he owned a rifle and when
confronted, in a subsequent interview, with a picture showing him
holding a rifle and pistol, he claimed that his face had been superimposed
on someone else’s body. He refused to answer any questions
about the presence in his wallet of a selective service card with his
picture and the name “Alek J. Hidell.”</p>

<p>During the questioning of Oswald on the third floor of the police
department, more than 100 representatives of the press, radio, and television
were crowded into the hallway through which Oswald had to
pass when being taken from his cell to Captain Fritz’ office for interrogation.
Reporters tried to interview Oswald during these
trips. Between Friday afternoon and Sunday morning he appeared
in the hallway at least 16 times. The generally confused conditions
outside and inside Captain Fritz’ office increased the difficulty of police
questioning. Advised by the police that he could communicate
with an attorney, Oswald made several telephone calls on Saturday in
an effort to procure representation of his own choice and discussed the
matter with the president of the local bar association, who offered to
obtain counsel. Oswald declined the offer saying that he would first
try to obtain counsel by himself. By Sunday morning he had not yet
engaged an attorney.</p>

<p>At 7:10 p.m. on November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald was formally
advised that he had been charged with the murder of Patrolman J.D.
Tippit. Several witnesses to the Tippit slaying and to the subsequent
flight of the gunman had positively identified Oswald in police lineups.
While positive firearm identification evidence was not available at the
time, the revolver in Oswald’s possession at the time of his arrest was
of a type which could have fired the shots that killed Tippit.</p>

<p>The formal charge against Oswald for the assassination of President
Kennedy was lodged shortly after 1:30 a.m., on Saturday, November
23. By 10 p.m. of the day of the assassination, the FBI had
traced the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book
Depository to a mailorder house in Chicago which had purchased it
from a distributor in New York. Approximately 6 hours later the
Chicago firm advised that this rifle had been ordered in March 1963
by an A. Hidel for shipment to post office box 2915, in Dallas, Tex., a
box rented by Oswald. Payment for the rifle was remitted by a
money order signed by A. Hidell. By 6:45 p.m. on November 23, the
FBI was able to advise the Dallas police that, as a result of handwriting
analysis of the documents used to purchase the rifle, it had
concluded that the rifle had been ordered by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Throughout Friday and Saturday, the Dallas police released to the
public many of the details concerning the alleged evidence against
Oswald. Police officials discussed important aspects of the case,
usually in the course of impromptu and confused press conferences in
the third-floor corridor. Some of the information divulged was erroneous.
Efforts by the news media representatives to reconstruct the
crime and promptly report details frequently led to erroneous and
often conflicting reports. At the urgings of the newsmen, Chief of
Police Jesse E. Curry, brought Oswald to a press conference in the
police assembly room shortly after midnight of the day Oswald was
arrested. The assembly room was crowded with newsmen who had
come to Dallas from all over the country. They shouted questions at
Oswald and flashed cameras at him. Among this group was a 52-year-old
Dallas nightclub operator—Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, November 24, arrangements were made for
Oswald’s transfer from the city jail to the Dallas County jail, about
1 mile away. The news media had been informed on Saturday night
that the transfer of Oswald would not take place until after 10 a.m.
on Sunday. Earlier on Sunday, between 2:30 and 3 a.m., anonymous
telephone calls threatening Oswald’s life had been received by the
Dallas office of the FBI and by the office of the county sheriff. Nevertheless,
on Sunday morning, television, radio, and newspaper representatives
crowded into the basement to record the transfer. As
viewed through television cameras, Oswald would emerge from a door
in front of the cameras and proceed to the transfer vehicle. To the
right of the cameras was a “down” ramp from Main Street on the
north. To the left was an “up” ramp leading to Commerce Street on
the south.</p>

<p>The armored truck in which Oswald was to be transferred arrived
shortly after 11 a.m. Police officials then decided, however, that an
unmarked police car would be preferable for the trip because of
its greater speed and maneuverability. At approximately 11:20 a.m.
Oswald emerged from the basement jail office flanked by detectives on
either side and at his rear. He took a few steps toward the car and was
in the glaring light of the television cameras when a man suddenly
darted out from an area on the right of the cameras where newsmen
had been assembled. The man was carrying a Colt .38 revolver in his
right hand and, while millions watched on television, he moved quickly
to within a few feet of Oswald and fired one shot into Oswald’s
abdomen. Oswald groaned with pain as he fell to the ground and
quickly lost consciousness. Within 7 minutes Oswald was at Parkland
Hospital where, without having regained consciousness, he was pronounced
dead at 1:07 p.m.</p>

<p>The man who killed Oswald was Jack Ruby. He was instantly
arrested and, minutes later, confined in a cell on the fifth floor of the
Dallas police jail. Under interrogation, he denied that the killing
of Oswald was in any way connected with a conspiracy involving the
assassination of President Kennedy. He maintained that he had
killed Oswald in a temporary fit of depression and rage over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
President’s death. Ruby was transferred the following day to the
county jail without notice to the press or to police officers not directly
involved in the transfer. Indicted for the murder of Oswald by the
State of Texas on November 26, 1963, Ruby was found guilty on
March 14, 1964, and sentenced to death. As of September 1964, his
case was pending on appeal.</p>

<h3 id="hdr5">CONCLUSIONS</h3>

<p>This Commission was created to ascertain the facts relating to the
preceding summary of events and to consider the important questions
which they raised. The Commission has addressed itself to this task
and has reached certain conclusions based on all the available evidence.
No limitations have been placed on the Commission’s inquiry;
it has conducted its own investigation, and all Government agencies
have fully discharged their responsibility to cooperate with the Commission
in its investigation. These conclusions represent the reasoned
judgment of all members of the Commission and are presented after
an investigation which has satisfied the Commission that it has ascertained
the truth concerning the assassination of President Kennedy
to the extent that a prolonged and thorough search makes this
possible.</p>

<p>1. The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor
Connally were fired from the sixth floor window at the southeast
corner of the Texas School Book Depository. This determination
is based upon the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Witnesses at the scene of the assassination saw a rifle being
fired from the sixth floor window of the Depository Building,
and some witnesses saw a rifle in the window immediately after
the shots were fired.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The nearly whole bullet found on Governor Connally’s
stretcher at Parkland Memorial Hospital and the two bullet fragments
found in the front seat of the Presidential limousine were
fired from the 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found on
the sixth floor of the Depository Building to the exclusion of all
other weapons.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The three used cartridge cases found near the window on
the sixth floor at the southeast corner of the building were fired
from the same rifle which fired the above-described bullet and
fragments, to the exclusion of all other weapons.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The windshield in the Presidential limousine was struck
by a bullet fragment on the inside surface of the glass, but was not
penetrated.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The nature of the bullet wounds suffered by President
Kennedy and Governor Connally and the location of the car at
the time of the shots establish that the bullets were fired from
above and behind the Presidential limousine, striking the President
and the Governor as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
(1) President Kennedy was first struck by a bullet which
entered at the back of his neck and exited through the lower
front portion of his neck, causing a wound which would not
necessarily have been lethal. The President was struck a second
time by a bullet which entered the right-rear portion
of his head, causing a massive and fatal wound.</p>

<p>(2) Governor Connally was struck by a bullet which
entered on the right side of his back and traveled downward
through the right side of his chest, exiting below his right
nipple. This bullet then passed through his right wrist and
entered his left thigh where it caused a superficial wound.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) There is no credible evidence that the shots were fired from
the Triple Underpass, ahead of the motorcade, or from any other
location.</p></blockquote>

<p>2. The weight of the evidence indicates that there were three shots
fired.</p>

<p>3. Although it is not necessary to any essential findings of the Commission
to determine just which shot hit Governor Connally, there is
very persuasive evidence from the experts to indicate that the same
bullet which pierced the President’s throat also caused Governor Connally’s
wounds. However, Governor Connally’s testimony and certain
other factors have given rise to some difference of opinion as to this
probability but there is no question in the mind of any member of the
Commission that all the shots which caused the President’s and Governor
Connally’s wounds were fired from the sixth floor window of
the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>4. The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded
Governor Connally were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald. This conclusion
is based upon the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle from
which the shots were fired was owned by and in the possession of
Oswald.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Oswald carried this rifle into the Depository Building
on the morning of November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Oswald, at the time of the assassination, was present at
the window from which the shots were fired.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Shortly after the assassination, the Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle belonging to Oswald was found partially hidden between
some cartons on the sixth floor and the improvised paper bag in
which Oswald brought the rifle to the Depository was found close
by the window from which the shots were fired.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Based on testimony of the experts and their analysis of
films of the assassination, the Commission has concluded that a
rifleman of Lee Harvey Oswald’s capabilities could have fired
the shots from the rifle used in the assassination within the
elapsed time of the shooting. The Commission has concluded
further that Oswald possessed the capability with a rifle which
enabled him to commit the assassination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
(<i>f</i>) Oswald lied to the police after his arrest concerning important
substantive matters.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Oswald had attempted to kill Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker
(Resigned, U. S. Army) on April 10, 1963, thereby demonstrating
his disposition to take human life.</p></blockquote>

<p>5. Oswald killed Dallas Police Patrolman J. D. Tippit approximately
45 minutes after the assassination. This conclusion upholds
the finding that Oswald fired the shots which killed President Kennedy
and wounded Governor Connally and is supported by the
following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Two eyewitnesses saw the Tippit shooting and seven
eyewitnesses heard the shots and saw the gunman leave the scene
with revolver in hand. These nine eyewitnesses positively identified
Lee Harvey Oswald as the man they saw.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The cartridge cases found at the scene of the shooting were
fired from the revolver in the possession of Oswald at the time
of his arrest to the exclusion of all other weapons.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The revolver in Oswald’s possession at the time of his arrest
was purchased by and belonged to Oswald.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Oswald’s jacket was found along the path of flight taken
by the gunman as he fled from the scene of the killing.</p></blockquote>

<p>6. Within 80 minutes of the assassination and 35 minutes of the
Tippit killing Oswald resisted arrest at the theatre by attempting to
shoot another Dallas police officer.</p>

<p>7. The Commission has reached the following conclusions concerning
Oswald’s interrogation and detention by the Dallas police:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Except for the force required to effect his arrest, Oswald
was not subjected to any physical coercion by any law enforcement
officials. He was advised that he could not be compelled
to give any information and that any statements made by him
might be used against him in court. He was advised of his right
to counsel. He was given the opportunity to obtain counsel of
his own choice and was offered legal assistance by the Dallas Bar
Association, which he rejected at that time.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Newspaper, radio, and television reporters were allowed
uninhibited access to the area through which Oswald had to pass
when he was moved from his cell to the interrogation room and
other sections of the building, thereby subjecting Oswald to harassment
and creating chaotic conditions which were not conducive to
orderly interrogation or the protection of the rights of the
prisoner.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The numerous statements, sometimes erroneous, made to
the press by various local law enforcement officials, during this
period of confusion and disorder in the police station, would have
presented serious obstacles to the obtaining of a fair trial for
Oswald. To the extent that the information was erroneous or
misleading, it helped to create doubts, speculations, and fears in
the mind of the public which might otherwise not have arisen.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
8. The Commission has reached the following conclusions concerning
the killing of Oswald by Jack Ruby on November 24, 1963:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Ruby entered the basement of the Dallas Police Department
shortly after 11:17 a.m. and killed Lee Harvey Oswald at
11:21 a.m.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Although the evidence on Ruby’s means of entry is not
conclusive, the weight of the evidence indicates that he walked
down the ramp leading from Main Street to the basement of the
police department.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) There is no evidence to support the rumor that Ruby may
have been assisted by any members of the Dallas Police Department
in the killing of Oswald.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The Dallas Police Department’s decision to transfer
Oswald to the county jail in full public view was unsound. The
arrangements made by the police department on Sunday morning,
only a few hours before the attempted transfer, were inadequate.
Of critical importance was the fact that news media representatives
and others were not excluded from the basement even after
the police were notified of threats to Oswald’s life. These deficiencies
contributed to the death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p></blockquote>

<p>9. The Commission has found no evidence that either Lee Harvey
Oswald or Jack Ruby was part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign,
to assassinate President Kennedy. The reasons for this conclusion
are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The Commission has found no evidence that anyone assisted
Oswald in planning or carrying out the assassination. In this
connection it has thoroughly investigated, among other factors,
the circumstances surrounding the planning of the motorcade
route through Dallas, the hiring of Oswald by the Texas School
Book Depository Co. on October 15, 1963, the method by which
the rifle was brought into the building, the placing of cartons of
books at the window, Oswald’s escape from the building, and the
testimony of eyewitnesses to the shooting.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The Commission has found no evidence that Oswald was
involved with any person or group in a conspiracy to assassinate
the President, although it has thoroughly investigated, in addition
to other possible leads, all facets of Oswald’s associations, finances,
and personal habits, particularly during the period following his
return from the Soviet Union in June 1962.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The Commission has found no evidence to show that Oswald
was employed, persuaded, or encouraged by any foreign
government to assassinate President Kennedy or that he was an
agent of any foreign government, although the Commission has
reviewed the circumstances surrounding Oswald’s defection to
the Soviet Union, his life there from October of 1959 to June of
1962 so far as it can be reconstructed, his known contacts with the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and his visits to the Cuban and
Soviet Embassies in Mexico City during his trip to Mexico from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
September 26 to October 3, 1963, and his known contacts with
the Soviet Embassy in the United States.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The Commission has explored all attempts of Oswald to
identify himself with various political groups, including the Communist
Party, U. S. A., the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and
the Socialist Workers Party, and has been unable to find any evidence
that the contacts which he initiated were related to Oswald’s
subsequent assassination of the President.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) All of the evidence before the Commission established that
there was nothing to support the speculation that Oswald was
an agent, employee, or informant of the FBI, the CIA, or any
other governmental agency. It has thoroughly investigated
Oswald’s relationships prior to the assassination with all agencies
of the U. S. Government. All contacts with Oswald by any of
these agencies were made in the regular exercise of their different
responsibilities.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) No direct or indirect relationship between Lee Harvey
Oswald and Jack Ruby has been discovered by the Commission,
nor has it been able to find any credible evidence that either knew
the other, although a thorough investigation was made of the
many rumors and speculations of such a relationship.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) The Commission has found no evidence that Jack Ruby
acted with any other person in the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) After careful investigation the Commission has found no
credible evidence either that Ruby and Officer Tippit, who was
killed by Oswald, knew each other or that Oswald and Tippit
knew each other.</p>

<p>Because of the difficulty of proving negatives to a certainty the
possibility of others being involved with either Oswald or Ruby
cannot be established categorically, but if there is any such evidence
it has been beyond the reach of all the investigative agencies
and resources of the United States and has not come to the attention
of this Commission.</p></blockquote>

<p>10. In its entire investigation the Commission has found no evidence
of conspiracy, subversion, or disloyalty to the U. S. Government by
any Federal, State, or local official.</p>

<p>11. On the basis of the evidence before the Commission it concludes
that Oswald acted alone. Therefore, to determine the motives for the
assassination of President Kennedy, one must look to the assassin himself.
Clues to Oswald’s motives can be found in his family history, his
education or lack of it, his acts, his writings, and the recollections of
those who had close contacts with him throughout his life. The Commission
has presented with this report all of the background information
bearing on motivation which it could discover. Thus, others
may study Lee Oswald’s life and arrive at their own conclusions as
to his possible motives.</p>

<p>The Commission could not make any definitive determination of
Oswald’s motives. It has endeavored to isolate factors which contributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
to his character and which might have influenced his decision
to assassinate President Kennedy. These factors were:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) His deep-rooted resentment of all authority which was
expressed in a hostility toward every society in which he lived;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) His inability to enter into meaningful relationships with
people, and a continuous pattern of rejecting his environment in
favor of new surroundings;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) His urge to try to find a place in history and despair at
times over failures in his various undertakings;</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) His capacity for violence as evidenced by his attempt to
kill General Walker;</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) His avowed commitment to Marxism and communism, as
he understood the terms and developed his own interpretation of
them; this was expressed by his antagonism toward the United
States, by his defection to the Soviet Union, by his failure to be
reconciled with life in the United States even after his disenchantment
with the Soviet Union, and by his efforts, though frustrated,
to go to Cuba.</p></blockquote>

<p>Each of these contributed to his capacity to risk all in cruel and
irresponsible actions.</p>

<p>12. The Commission recognizes that the varied responsibilities of
the President require that he make frequent trips to all parts of the
United States and abroad. Consistent with their high responsibilities
Presidents can never be protected from every potential threat. The
Secret Service’s difficulty in meeting its protective responsibility varies
with the activities and the nature of the occupant of the Office of President
and his willingness to conform to plans for his safety. In appraising
the performance of the Secret Service it should be understood
that it has to do its work within such limitations. Nevertheless, the
Commission believes that recommendations for improvements in
Presidential protection are compelled by the facts disclosed in this
investigation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The complexities of the Presidency have increased so
rapidly in recent years that the Secret Service has not been able to
develop or to secure adequate resources of personnel and facilities
to fulfill its important assignment. This situation should be
promptly remedied.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The Commission has concluded that the criteria and procedures
of the Secret Service designed to identify and protect
against persons considered threats to the president, were not
adequate prior to the assassination.</p>

<p>(1) The Protective Research Section of the Secret Service,
which is responsible for its preventive work, lacked sufficient
trained personnel and the mechanical and technical
assistance needed to fulfill its responsibility.</p>

<p>(2) Prior to the assassination the Secret Service’s criteria
dealt with direct threats against the President. Although the
Secret Service treated the direct threats against the President
adequately, it failed to recognize the necessity of identifying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
other potential sources of danger to his security. The Secret
Service did not develop adequate and specific criteria defining
those persons or groups who might present a danger to the
President. In effect, the Secret Service largely relied upon
other Federal or State agencies to supply the information
necessary for it to fulfill its preventive responsibilities, although
it did ask for information about direct threats to the
President.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The Commission has concluded that there was insufficient
liaison and coordination of information between the Secret Service
and other Federal agencies necessarily concerned with Presidential
protection. Although the FBI, in the normal exercise of
its responsibility, had secured considerable information about Lee
Harvey Oswald, it had no official responsibility, under the Secret
Service criteria existing at the time of the President’s trip to
Dallas, to refer to the Secret Service the information it had about
Oswald. The Commission has concluded, however, that the FBI
took an unduly restrictive view of its role in preventive intelligence
work prior to the assassination. A more carefully coordinated
treatment of the Oswald case by the FBI might well have
resulted in bringing Oswald’s activities to the attention of the
Secret Service.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The Commission has concluded that some of the advance
preparations in Dallas made by the Secret Service, such as the
detailed security measures taken at Love Field and the Trade
Mart, were thorough and well executed. In other respects, however,
the Commission has concluded that the advance preparations
for the President’s trip were deficient.</p>

<p>(1) Although the Secret Service is compelled to rely to a
great extent on local law enforcement officials, its procedures
at the time of the Dallas trip did not call for well-defined
instructions as to the respective responsibilities of the police
officials and others assisting in the protection of the President.</p>

<p>(2) The procedures relied upon by the Secret Service for
detecting the presence of an assassin located in a building
along a motorcade route were inadequate. At the time of
the trip to Dallas, the Secret Service as a matter of practice
did not investigate, or cause to be checked, any building
located along the motorcade route to be taken by the President.
The responsibility for observing windows in these
buildings during the motorcade was divided between local
police personnel stationed on the streets to regulate crowds
and Secret Service agents riding in the motorcade. Based
on its investigation the Commission has concluded that these
arrangements during the trip to Dallas were clearly not
sufficient.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The configuration of the Presidential car and the seating
arrangements of the Secret Service agents in the car did not afford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
the Secret Service agents the opportunity they should have had to
be of immediate assistance to the President at the first sign of
danger.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Within these limitations, however, the Commission finds
that the agents most immediately responsible for the President’s
safety reacted promptly at the time the shots were fired from
the Texas School Book Depository Building.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="hdr6">RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>

<p>Prompted by the assassination of President Kennedy, the Secret
Service has initiated a comprehensive and critical review of its total
operations. As a result of studies conducted during the past several
months, and in cooperation with this Commission, the Secret Service
has prepared a planning document dated August 27, 1964, which
recommends various programs considered necessary by the Service
to improve its techniques and enlarge its resources. The Commission
is encouraged by the efforts taken by the Secret Service since the
assassination and suggests the following recommendations.</p>

<p>1. A committee of Cabinet members including the Secretary of the
Treasury and the Attorney General, or the National Security Council,
should be assigned the responsibility of reviewing and overseeing
the protective activities of the Secret Service and the other Federal
agencies that assist in safeguarding the President. Once given this
responsibility, such a committee would insure that the maximum resources
of the Federal Government are fully engaged in the task of
protecting the President, and would provide guidance in defining the
general nature of domestic and foreign dangers to Presidential
security.</p>

<p>2. Suggestions have been advanced to the Commission for the transfer
of all or parts of the Presidential protective responsibilities of
the Secret Service to some other department or agency. The Commission
believes that if there is to be any determination of whether
or not to relocate these responsibilities and functions, it ought to be
made by the Executive and the Congress, perhaps upon recommendations
based on studies by the previously suggested committee.</p>

<p>3. Meanwhile, in order to improve daily supervision of the Secret
Service within the Department of the Treasury, the Commission recommends
that the Secretary of the Treasury appoint a special assistant
with the responsibility of supervising the Secret Service. This
special assistant should have sufficient stature and experience in law
enforcement, intelligence, and allied fields to provide effective continuing
supervision, and to keep the Secretary fully informed regarding
the performance of the Secret Service. One of the initial
assignments of this special assistant should be the supervision of the
current effort by the Secret Service to revise and modernize its basic
operating procedures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
4. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service completely
overhaul its facilities devoted to the advance detection of potential
threats against the President. The Commission suggests the following
measures.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The Secret Service should develop as quickly as possible
more useful and precise criteria defining those potential threats
to the President which should be brought to its attention by other
agencies. The criteria should, among other additions, provide
for prompt notice to the Secret Service of all returned defectors.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The Secret Service should expedite its current plans to
utilize the most efficient data-processing techniques.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Once the Secret Service has formulated new criteria delineating
the information it desires, it should enter into agreements
with each Federal agency to insure its receipt of such
information.</p></blockquote>

<p>5. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service improve
the protective measures followed in the planning, and conducting of
Presidential motorcades. In particular, the Secret Service should
continue its current efforts to increase the precautionary attention
given to buildings along the motorcade route.</p>

<p>6. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service continue
its recent efforts to improve and formalize its relationships with local
police departments in areas to be visited by the President.</p>

<p>7. The Commission believes that when the new criteria and procedures
are established, the Secret Service will not have sufficient personnel
or adequate facilities. The Commission recommends that the
Secret Service be provided with the personnel and resources which
the Service and the Department of the Treasury may be able to demonstrate
are needed to fulfill its important mission.</p>

<p>8. Even with an increase in Secret Service personnel, the protection
of the President will continue to require the resources and cooperation
of many Federal agencies. The Commission recommends that these
agencies, specifically the FBI, continue the practice as it has developed,
particularly since the assassination, of assisting the Secret Service upon
request by providing personnel or other aid, and that there be a closer
association and liaison between the Secret Service and all Federal
agencies.</p>

<p>9. The Commission recommends that the President’s physician always
accompany him during his travels and occupy a position near the
President where he can be immediately available in case of any
emergency.</p>

<p>10. The Commission recommends to Congress that it adopt legislation
which would make the assassination of the President and Vice
President a Federal crime. A state of affairs where U.S. authorities
have no clearly defined jurisdiction to investigate the assassination of
a President is anomalous.</p>

<p>11. The Commission has examined the Department of State’s handling
of the Oswald matters and finds that it followed the law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
throughout. However, the Commission believes that the Department
in accordance with its own regulations should in all cases exercise
great care in the return to this country of defectors who have evidenced
disloyalty or hostility to this country or who have expressed a desire
to renounce their American citizenship and that when such persons
are so returned, procedures should be adopted for the better dissemination
of information concerning them to the intelligence agencies of
the Government.</p>

<p>12. The Commission recommends that the representatives of the bar,
law enforcement associations, and the news media work together to
establish ethical standards concerning the collection and presentation
of information to the public so that there will be no interference with
pending criminal investigations, court proceedings, or the right of
individuals to a fair trial.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Assassination</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">This chapter</span> describes President Kennedy’s trip to Dallas,
from its origin through its tragic conclusion. The narrative
of these events is based largely on the recollections of the
participants, although in many instances documentary or other evidence
has also been used by the Commission. Beginning with the
advance plans and Secret Service preparations for the trip, this chapter
reviews the motorcade through Dallas, the fleeting moments of
the assassination, the activities at Parkland Memorial Hospital, and
the return of the Presidential party to Washington. An evaluation
of the procedures employed to safeguard the President, with recommendations
for improving these procedures, appears in chapter VIII
of the report.</p>

<h3 id="hdr8">PLANNING THE TEXAS TRIP</h3>

<p>President Kennedy’s visit to Texas in November 1963 had been
under consideration for almost a year before it occurred. He had
made only a few brief visits to the State since the 1960 Presidential
campaign and in 1962 he began to consider a formal visit.<a id="FNanchor_C2-1" href="#Footnote_C2-1" class="fnanchor">C2-1</a> During
1963, the reasons for making the trip became more persuasive. As a
political leader, the President wished to resolve the factional controversy
within the Democratic Party in Texas before the election of 1964.<a id="FNanchor_C2-2" href="#Footnote_C2-2" class="fnanchor">C2-2</a>
The party itself saw an opportunity to raise funds by having the
President speak at a political dinner eventually planned for Austin.<a id="FNanchor_C2-3" href="#Footnote_C2-3" class="fnanchor">C2-3</a>
As Chief of State, the President always welcomed the opportunity
to learn, firsthand, about the problems which concerned the American
people.<a id="FNanchor_C2-4" href="#Footnote_C2-4" class="fnanchor">C2-4</a> Moreover, he looked forward to the public appearances
which he personally enjoyed.<a id="FNanchor_C2-5" href="#Footnote_C2-5" class="fnanchor">C2-5</a></p>

<p>The basic decision on the November trip to Texas was made at a
meeting of President Kennedy, Vice President Johnson, and Governor
Connally on June 5, 1963, at the Cortez Hotel in El Paso, Tex.<a id="FNanchor_C2-6" href="#Footnote_C2-6" class="fnanchor">C2-6</a> The
President had spoken earlier that day at the Air Force Academy in
Colorado Springs, Colo., and had stopped in El Paso to discuss the
proposed visit and other matters with the Vice President and the
Governor.<a id="FNanchor_C2-7" href="#Footnote_C2-7" class="fnanchor">C2-7</a> The three agreed that the President would come to Texas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
in late November 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C2-8" href="#Footnote_C2-8" class="fnanchor">C2-8</a> The original plan called for the President to
spend only 1 day in the State, making whirlwind visits to Dallas, Fort
Worth, San Antonio, and Houston.<a id="FNanchor_C2-9" href="#Footnote_C2-9" class="fnanchor">C2-9</a> In September, the White House
decided to permit further visits by the President and extended the
trip to run from the afternoon of November 21 through the evening
of Friday, November 22.<a id="FNanchor_C2-10" href="#Footnote_C2-10" class="fnanchor">C2-10</a> When Governor Connally called at the
White House on October 4 to discuss the details of the visit, it was
agreed that the planning of events in Texas would be left largely to
the Governor.<a id="FNanchor_C2-11" href="#Footnote_C2-11" class="fnanchor">C2-11</a> At the White House, Kenneth O’Donnell, special
assistant to the President, acted as coordinator for the trip.<a id="FNanchor_C2-12" href="#Footnote_C2-12" class="fnanchor">C2-12</a></p>

<p>Everyone agreed that, if there was sufficient time, a motorcade
through downtown Dallas would be the best way for the people to
see their President. When the trip was planned for only 1 day,
Governor Connally had opposed the motorcade because there was
not enough time.<a id="FNanchor_C2-13" href="#Footnote_C2-13" class="fnanchor">C2-13</a> The Governor stated, however, that “once we
got San Antonio moved from Friday to Thursday afternoon, where
that was his initial stop in Texas, then we had the time, and I withdrew
my objections to a motorcade.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-14" href="#Footnote_C2-14" class="fnanchor">C2-14</a> According to O’Donnell, “we
had a motorcade wherever we went,” particularly in large cities where
the purpose was to let the President be seen by as many people as
possible.<a id="FNanchor_C2-15" href="#Footnote_C2-15" class="fnanchor">C2-15</a> In his experience, “it would be automatic” for the Secret
Service to arrange a route which would, within the time allotted,
bring the President “through an area which exposes him to the greatest
number of people.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-16" href="#Footnote_C2-16" class="fnanchor">C2-16</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr9">ADVANCE PREPARATIONS FOR THE DALLAS TRIP</h3>

<p>Advance preparations for President Kennedy’s visit to Dallas were
primarily the responsibility of two Secret Service agents: Special
Agent Winston G. Lawson, a member of the White House detail who
acted as the advance agent, and Forrest V. Sorrels, special agent in
charge of the Dallas office.<a id="FNanchor_C2-17" href="#Footnote_C2-17" class="fnanchor">C2-17</a> Both agents were advised of the trip on
November 4.<a id="FNanchor_C2-18" href="#Footnote_C2-18" class="fnanchor">C2-18</a> Lawson received a tentative schedule of the Texas
trip on November 8 from Roy H. Kellerman, assistant special agent
in charge of the White House detail, who was the Secret Service official
responsible for the entire Texas journey.<a id="FNanchor_C2-19" href="#Footnote_C2-19" class="fnanchor">C2-19</a> As advance agent
working closely with Sorrels, Lawson had responsibility for arranging
the timetable for the President’s visit to Dallas and coordinating
local activities with the White House staff, the organizations directly
concerned with the visit, and local law enforcement officials.<a id="FNanchor_C2-20" href="#Footnote_C2-20" class="fnanchor">C2-20</a> Lawson’s
most important responsibilities were to take preventive action
against anyone in Dallas considered a threat to the President, to select
the luncheon site and motorcade route, and to plan security measures
for the luncheon and the motorcade.</p>

<h4 id="hdr10">Preventive Intelligence Activities</h4>

<p>The Protective Research Section (PRS) of the Secret Service maintains
records of people who have threatened the President or so conducted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
themselves as to be deemed a potential danger to him. On
November 8, 1963, after undertaking the responsibility for advance
preparations for the visit to Dallas, Agent Lawson went to the PRS
offices in Washington. A check of the geographic indexes there revealed
no listing for any individual deemed to be a potential danger
to the President in the territory of the Secret Service regional office
which includes Dallas and Fort Worth.<a id="FNanchor_C2-21" href="#Footnote_C2-21" class="fnanchor">C2-21</a></p>

<p>To supplement the PRS files, the Secret Service depends largely
on local police departments and local offices of other Federal agencies
which advise it of potential threats immediately before the visit of
the President to their community. Upon his arrival in Dallas on
November 12 Lawson conferred with the local police and the local
office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation about potential dangers
to the President. Although there was no mention in PRS files of
the demonstration in Dallas against Ambassador Adlai Stevenson on
October 24, 1963, Lawson inquired about the incident and obtained
through the local police photographs of some of the persons involved.<a id="FNanchor_C2-22" href="#Footnote_C2-22" class="fnanchor">C2-22</a>
On November 22 a Secret Service agent stood at the entrance to the
Trade Mart, where the President was scheduled to speak, with copies
of these photographs. Dallas detectives in the lobby of the Trade
Mart and in the luncheon area also had copies of these photographs.
A number of people who resembled some of those in the photographs
were placed under surveillance at the Trade Mart.<a id="FNanchor_C2-23" href="#Footnote_C2-23" class="fnanchor">C2-23</a></p>

<p>The FBI office in Dallas gave the local Secret Service representatives
the name of a possibly dangerous individual in the Dallas area
who was investigated. It also advised the Secret Service of the circulation
on November 21 of a handbill sharply critical of President
Kennedy,<a id="FNanchor_C2-24" href="#Footnote_C2-24" class="fnanchor">C2-24</a> discussed in chapter VI of this report. Shortly before,
the Dallas police had reported to the Secret Service that the handbill
had appeared on the streets of Dallas. Neither the Dallas police nor
the FBI had yet learned the source of the handbill.<a id="FNanchor_C2-25" href="#Footnote_C2-25" class="fnanchor">C2-25</a> No one else was
identified to the Secret Service through local inquiry as potentially
dangerous, nor did PRS develop any additional information between
November 12, when Lawson left Washington, and November 22. The
adequacy of the intelligence system maintained by the Secret Service
at the time of the assassination, including a detailed description of
the available data on Lee Harvey Oswald and the reasons why his
name had not been furnished to the Secret Service, is discussed in
chapter VIII.</p>

<h4 id="hdr11">The Luncheon Site</h4>

<p>An important purpose of the President’s visit to Dallas was to speak
at a luncheon given by business and civic leaders. The White House
staff informed the Secret Service that the President would arrive
and depart from Dallas’ Love Field; that a motorcade through the
downtown area of Dallas to the luncheon site should be arranged;
and that following the luncheon the President would return to the
airport by the most direct route. Accordingly, it was important to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
determine the luncheon site as quickly as possible, so that security
could be established at the site and the motorcade route selected.</p>

<p>On November 4, Gerald A. Behn, agent in charge of the White House
detail, asked Sorrels to examine three potential sites for the luncheon.<a id="FNanchor_C2-26" href="#Footnote_C2-26" class="fnanchor">C2-26</a>
One building, Market Hall, was unavailable for November 22. The
second, the Women’s Building at the State Fair Grounds, was a one-story
building with few entrances and easy to make secure, but it
lacked necessary food-handling facilities and had certain unattractive
features, including a low ceiling with exposed conduits and beams.
The third possibility, the Trade Mart, a handsome new building with
all the necessary facilities, presented security problems. It had
numerous entrances, several tiers of balconies surrounding the central
court where the luncheon would be held, and several catwalks crossing
the court at each level. On November 4, Sorrels told Behn he believed
security difficulties at the Trade Mart could be overcome by special
precautions.<a id="FNanchor_C2-27" href="#Footnote_C2-27" class="fnanchor">C2-27</a> Lawson also evaluated the security hazards at the
Trade Mart on November 13.<a id="FNanchor_C2-28" href="#Footnote_C2-28" class="fnanchor">C2-28</a> Kenneth O’Donnell made the final
decision to hold the luncheon at the Trade Mart; Behn so notified
Lawson on November 14.<a id="FNanchor_C2-29" href="#Footnote_C2-29" class="fnanchor">C2-29</a></p>

<p>Once the Trade Mart had been selected, Sorrels and Lawson worked
out detailed arrangements for security at the building. In addition to
the preventive measures already mentioned, they provided for controlling
access to the building, closing off and policing areas around
it, securing the roof and insuring the presence of numerous police officers
inside and around the building. Ultimately more than 200 law
enforcement officers, mainly Dallas police but including 8 Secret Service
agents, were deployed in and around the Trade Mart.<a id="FNanchor_C2-30" href="#Footnote_C2-30" class="fnanchor">C2-30</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr12">The Motorcade Route</h4>

<p>On November 8, when Lawson was briefed on the itinerary for the
trip to Dallas, he was told that 45 minutes had been allotted for a
motorcade procession from Love Field to the luncheon site.<a id="FNanchor_C2-31" href="#Footnote_C2-31" class="fnanchor">C2-31</a> Lawson
was not specifically instructed to select the parade route, but he understood
that this was one of his functions.<a id="FNanchor_C2-32" href="#Footnote_C2-32" class="fnanchor">C2-32</a> Even before the Trade
Mart had been definitely selected, Lawson and Sorrels began to consider
the best motorcade route from Love Field to the Trade Mart.
On November 14, Lawson and Sorrels attended a meeting at Love
Field and on their return to Dallas drove over the route which Sorrels
believed best suited for the proposed motorcade.<a id="FNanchor_C2-33" href="#Footnote_C2-33" class="fnanchor">C2-33</a> This route, eventually
selected for the motorcade from the airport to the Trade Mart,
measured 10 miles and could be driven easily within the allotted 45
minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C2-34" href="#Footnote_C2-34" class="fnanchor">C2-34</a> From Love Field the route passed through a portion of
suburban Dallas, through the downtown area along Main Street and
then to the Trade Mart via Stemmons Freeway. For the President’s
return to Love Field following the luncheon, the agents selected the
most direct route, which was approximately 4 miles.<a id="FNanchor_C2-35" href="#Footnote_C2-35" class="fnanchor">C2-35</a></p>

<p>After the selection of the Trade Mart as the luncheon site, Lawson
and Sorrels met with Dallas Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry, Assistant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Chief Charles Batchelor, Deputy Chief N. T. Fisher, and several
other command officers to discuss details of the motorcade and possible
routes.<a id="FNanchor_C2-36" href="#Footnote_C2-36" class="fnanchor">C2-36</a> The route was further reviewed by Lawson and Sorrels
with Assistant Chief Batchelor and members of the local host committee
on November 15. The police officials agreed that the route
recommended by Sorrels was the proper one and did not express a
belief that any other route might be better.<a id="FNanchor_C2-37" href="#Footnote_C2-37" class="fnanchor">C2-37</a> On November 18, Sorrels
and Lawson drove over the selected route with Batchelor and other
police officers, verifying that it could be traversed within 45 minutes.
Representatives of the local host committee and the White House staff
were advised by the Secret Service of the actual route on the afternoon
of November 18.<a id="FNanchor_C2-38" href="#Footnote_C2-38" class="fnanchor">C2-38</a></p>

<p>The route impressed the agents as a natural and desirable one.
Sorrels, who had participated in Presidential protection assignments
in Dallas since a visit by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936,<a id="FNanchor_C2-39" href="#Footnote_C2-39" class="fnanchor">C2-39</a>
testified that the traditional parade route in Dallas was along Main
Street, since the tall buildings along the street gave more people an
opportunity to participate.<a id="FNanchor_C2-40" href="#Footnote_C2-40" class="fnanchor">C2-40</a> The route chosen from the airport to
Main Street was the normal one, except where Harwood Street was
selected as the means of access to Main Street in preference to a short
stretch of the Central Expressway, which presented a minor safety
hazard and could not accommodate spectators as conveniently as Harwood
Street.<a id="FNanchor_C2-41" href="#Footnote_C2-41" class="fnanchor">C2-41</a> According to Lawson, the chosen route seemed to be
the best.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It afforded us wide streets most of the way, because of the buses
that were in the motorcade. It afforded us a chance to have
alternative routes if something happened on the motorcade route.
It was the type of suburban area a good part of the way where
the crowds would be able to be controlled for a great distance,
and we figured that the largest crowds would be downtown,
which they were, and that the wide streets that we would use
downtown would be of sufficient width to keep the public out
of our way.<a id="FNanchor_C2-42" href="#Footnote_C2-42" class="fnanchor">C2-42</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Elm Street, parallel to Main Street and one block north, was not used
for the main portion of the downtown part of the motorcade because
Main Street offered better vantage points for spectators.</p>

<p>To reach the Trade Mart from Main Street the agents decided to
use the Stemmons Freeway (Route No. 77), the most direct route. The
only practical way for westbound traffic on Main Street to reach the
northbound lanes of the Stemmons Freeway is via Elm Street, which
Route No. 77 traffic is instructed to follow in this part of the city. (See
Commission Exhibit No. 2113, <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>.) Elm Street was to be reached
from Main by turning right at Houston, going one block north and
then turning left onto Elm. On this last portion of the journey, only
5 minutes from the Trade Mart, the President’s motorcade would pass
the Texas School Book Depository Building on the northwest corner
of Houston and Elm Streets. The building overlooks Dealey Plaza,
an attractively landscaped triangle of 3 acres. (See Commission Exhibit
No. 876, <a href="#Page_33">p. 33</a>.) From Houston Street, which forms the
base of the triangle, three streets—Commerce, Main, and Elm—trisect
the plaza, converging at the apex of the triangle to form a triple underpass
beneath a multiple railroad bridge almost 500 feet from Houston
Street.<a id="FNanchor_C2-43" href="#Footnote_C2-43" class="fnanchor">C2-43</a> Elm Street, the northernmost of the three, after
intersecting Houston curves in a southwesterly arc through the underpass
and leads into an access road, which branches off to the right
and is used by traffic going to the Stemmons Freeway and the Dallas-Fort
Worth Turnpike. (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 2113-2116,
<a href="#Page_34">pp. 34-37</a>.)</p>

<p>Traffic sign on Main Street which directs westbound traffic to turn right at Houston Street
to gain access to the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
The Elm Street approach to the Stemmons Freeway is necessary in
order to avoid the traffic hazards which would otherwise exist if right
turns were permitted from both Main and Elm into the freeway. To
create this traffic pattern, a concrete barrier between Main and Elm
Streets presents an obstacle to a right turn from Main across Elm to
the access road to Stemmons Freeway and the Dallas-Fort Worth
Turnpike. This concrete barrier extends far enough beyond the
access road to make it impracticable for vehicles to turn right
from Main directly to the access road. A sign located on this
barrier instructs Main Street traffic not to make any turns.<a id="FNanchor_C2-45" href="#Footnote_C2-45" class="fnanchor">C2-45</a> (See
Commission Exhibits Nos. 2114-2116, <a href="#Page_35">pp. 35-37</a>.) In conformity with
these arrangements, traffic proceeding west on Main is directed to turn
right at Houston in order to reach the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike,
which has the same access road from Elm Street as does the Stemmons
Freeway.<a id="FNanchor_C2-46" href="#Footnote_C2-46" class="fnanchor">C2-46</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 2967, <a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>.)</p>

<p>The planning for the motorcade also included advance preparations
for security arrangements along the route. Sorrels and Lawson reviewed
the route in cooperation with Assistant Chief Batchelor and
other Dallas police officials who took notes on the requirements for
controlling the crowds and traffic, watching the overpasses, and providing
motorcycle escort.<a id="FNanchor_C2-47" href="#Footnote_C2-47" class="fnanchor">C2-47</a> To control traffic, arrangements were
made for the deployment of foot patrolmen and motorcycle police
at various positions along the route.<a id="FNanchor_C2-48" href="#Footnote_C2-48" class="fnanchor">C2-48</a> Police were assigned to each
overpass on the route and instructed to keep them clear of unauthorized
persons.<a id="FNanchor_C2-49" href="#Footnote_C2-49" class="fnanchor">C2-49</a> No arrangements were made for police or building
custodians to inspect buildings along the motorcade route since the
Secret Service did not normally request or make such a check.<a id="FNanchor_C2-50" href="#Footnote_C2-50" class="fnanchor">C2-50</a>
Under standard procedures, the responsibility for watching the windows
of buildings was shared by local police stationed along the route
and Secret Service agents riding in the motorcade.<a id="FNanchor_C2-51" href="#Footnote_C2-51" class="fnanchor">C2-51</a></p>

<p>As the date for the President’s visit approached, the two Dallas
newspapers carried several reports of his motorcade route. The selection
of the Trade Mart as the possible site for the luncheon first
appeared in the Dallas Times-Herald on November 15, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C2-52" href="#Footnote_C2-52" class="fnanchor">C2-52</a> The
following day, the newspaper reported that the Presidential party
“apparently will loop through the downtown area, probably on Main
Street, en route from Dallas Love Field” on its way to the Trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Mart.<a id="FNanchor_C2-53" href="#Footnote_C2-53" class="fnanchor">C2-53</a> On November 19, the Times-Herald afternoon paper detailed
the precise route:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From the airport, the President’s party will proceed to Mockingbird
Lane to Lemmon and then to Turtle Creek, turning south to
Cedar Springs.</p>

<p>The motorcade will then pass through downtown on Harwood
and then west on Main, turning back to Elm at Houston and
then out Stemmons Freeway to the Trade Mart.<a id="FNanchor_C2-54" href="#Footnote_C2-54" class="fnanchor">C2-54</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Also on November 19, the Morning News reported that the President’s
motorcade would travel from Love Field along specified streets, then
“Harwood to Main, Main to Houston, Houston to Elm, Elm under the
Triple Underpass to Stemmons Freeway, and on to the Trade Mart.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-55" href="#Footnote_C2-55" class="fnanchor">C2-55</a>
On November 20 a front page story reported that the streets on
which the Presidential motorcade would travel included “Main
and Stemmons Freeway.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-56" href="#Footnote_C2-56" class="fnanchor">C2-56</a> On the morning of the President’s arrival,
the Morning News noted that the motorcade would travel
through downtown Dallas onto the Stemmons Freeway, and reported
that “the motorcade will move slowly so that crowds can ‘get a good
view’ of President Kennedy and his wife.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-57" href="#Footnote_C2-57" class="fnanchor">C2-57</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr13">DALLAS BEFORE THE VISIT</h3>

<p>The President’s intention to pay a visit to Texas in the fall of 1963
aroused interest throughout the State. The two Dallas newspapers
provided their readers with a steady stream of information and speculation
about the trip, beginning on September 13, when the Times-Herald
announced in a front page article that President Kennedy
was planning a brief 1-day tour of four Texas cities—Dallas, Fort
Worth, San Antonio, and Houston.<a id="FNanchor_C2-58" href="#Footnote_C2-58" class="fnanchor">C2-58</a> Both Dallas papers cited White
House sources on September 26 as confirming the President’s intention
to visit Texas on November 21 and 22, with Dallas scheduled as one
of the stops.<a id="FNanchor_C2-59" href="#Footnote_C2-59" class="fnanchor">C2-59</a></p>

<p>Articles, editorials, and letters to the editor in the Dallas Morning
News and the Dallas Times-Herald after September 13 reflected the
feeling in the community toward the forthcoming Presidential visit.
Although there were critical editorials and letters to the editors, the
news stories reflected the desire of Dallas officials to welcome the
President with dignity and courtesy. An editorial in the Times-Herald
of September 17 called on the people of Dallas to be “congenial
hosts” even though “Dallas didn’t vote for Mr. Kennedy in
1960, may not endorse him in ’64.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-60" href="#Footnote_C2-60" class="fnanchor">C2-60</a> On October 3 the Dallas Morning
News quoted U.S. Representative Joe Pool’s hope that President
Kennedy would receive a “good welcome” and would not face demonstrations
like those encountered by Vice President Johnson during
the 1960 campaign.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span><a id="FNanchor_C2-61" href="#Footnote_C2-61" class="fnanchor">C2-61</a></p>

<p>Increased concern about the President’s visit was aroused by the
incident involving the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai
E. Stevenson. On the evening of October 24, 1963, after addressing
a meeting in Dallas, Stevenson was jeered, jostled, and spat upon by
hostile demonstrators outside the Dallas Memorial Auditorium Theater.<a id="FNanchor_C2-62" href="#Footnote_C2-62" class="fnanchor">C2-62</a>
The local, national, and international reaction to this incident
evoked from Dallas officials and newspapers strong condemnations of
the demonstrators. Mayor Earle Cabell called on the city to redeem
itself during President Kennedy’s visit.<a id="FNanchor_C2-63" href="#Footnote_C2-63" class="fnanchor">C2-63</a> He asserted that Dallas
had shed its reputation of the twenties as the “Southwest hate capital
of Dixie.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-64" href="#Footnote_C2-64" class="fnanchor">C2-64</a> On October 26 the press reported Chief of Police Curry’s
plans to call in 100 extra off-duty officers to help protect President
Kennedy.<a id="FNanchor_C2-65" href="#Footnote_C2-65" class="fnanchor">C2-65</a> Any thought that the President might cancel his visit
to Dallas was ended when Governor Connally confirmed on November
8 that the President would come to Texas on November 21-22,
and that he would visit San Antonio, Houston, Fort Worth, Dallas,
and Austin.<a id="FNanchor_C2-66" href="#Footnote_C2-66" class="fnanchor">C2-66</a></p>

<p>During November the Dallas papers reported frequently on the
plans for protecting the President, stressing the thoroughness of the
preparations. They conveyed the pleas of Dallas leaders that citizens
not demonstrate or create disturbances during the President’s visit.
On November 18 the Dallas City Council adopted a new city ordinance
prohibiting interference with attendance at lawful assemblies.<a id="FNanchor_C2-67" href="#Footnote_C2-67" class="fnanchor">C2-67</a> Two
days before the President’s arrival Chief Curry warned that the Dallas
police would not permit improper conduct during the President’s
visit.<a id="FNanchor_C2-68" href="#Footnote_C2-68" class="fnanchor">C2-68</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, on November 17 the president of the Dallas Chamber of
Commerce referred to the city’s reputation for being the friendliest
town in America and asserted that citizens would “greet the President
of the United States with the warmth and pride that keep the Dallas
spirit famous the world over.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-69" href="#Footnote_C2-69" class="fnanchor">C2-69</a> Two days later, a local Republican
leader called for a “civilized nonpartisan” welcome for President
Kennedy, stating that “in many respects Dallas County has isolated
itself from the main stream of life in the world in this decade.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-70" href="#Footnote_C2-70" class="fnanchor">C2-70</a></p>

<p>Another reaction to the impending visit—hostile to the President—came
to a head shortly before his arrival. On November 21 there
appeared on the streets of Dallas the anonymous handbill mentioned
above. It was fashioned after the “wanted” circulars issued by law
enforcement agencies. Beneath two photographs of President Kennedy,
one fullface and one profile, appeared the caption, “Wanted
for Treason,” followed by a scurrilous bill of particulars that constituted
a vilification of the President.<a id="FNanchor_C2-71" href="#Footnote_C2-71" class="fnanchor">C2-71</a> And on the morning of the
President’s arrival, there appeared in the Morning News a full page,
black-bordered advertisement headed “Welcome Mr. Kennedy to
Dallas,” sponsored by the American Factfinding Committee, which
the sponsor later testified was an ad hoc committee “formed strictly
for the purpose of having a name to put in the paper.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-72" href="#Footnote_C2-72" class="fnanchor">C2-72</a> The “welcome”
consisted of a series of statements and questions critical of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
President and his administration.<a id="FNanchor_C2-73" href="#Footnote_C2-73" class="fnanchor">C2-73</a> (See Commission Exhibit No.
1031, <a href="#Page_294">p. 294</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="hdr14">VISITS TO OTHER TEXAS CITIES</h3>

<p>The trip to Texas began with the departure of President and Mrs.
Kennedy from the White House by helicopter at 10:45 a.m., e.s.t., on
November 21, 1963, for Andrews AFB. They took off in the Presidential
plane, <i>Air Force One</i>, at 11 a.m., arriving at San Antonio at
1:30 p.m., c.s.t. They were greeted by Vice President Johnson and
Governor Connally, who joined the Presidential party in a motorcade
through San Antonio.<a id="FNanchor_C2-74" href="#Footnote_C2-74" class="fnanchor">C2-74</a> During the afternoon, President Kennedy
dedicated the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks
AFB.<a id="FNanchor_C2-75" href="#Footnote_C2-75" class="fnanchor">C2-75</a> Late in the afternoon he flew to Houston where he rode
through the city in a motorcade, spoke at the Rice University Stadium,
and attended a dinner in honor of U.S. Representative Albert
Thomas.<a id="FNanchor_C2-76" href="#Footnote_C2-76" class="fnanchor">C2-76</a></p>

<p>At Rice Stadium a very large, enthusiastic crowd greeted the President.<a id="FNanchor_C2-77" href="#Footnote_C2-77" class="fnanchor">C2-77</a>
In Houston, as elsewhere during the trip, the crowds showed
much interest in Mrs. Kennedy. David F. Powers of the President’s
staff later stated that when the President asked for his assessment of
the day’s activities, Powers replied “that the crowd was about the same
as the one which came to see him before but there were 100,000 extra
people on hand who came to see Mrs. Kennedy.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-78" href="#Footnote_C2-78" class="fnanchor">C2-78</a> Late in the evening,
the Presidential party flew to Fort Worth where they spent the
night at the Texas Hotel.<a id="FNanchor_C2-79" href="#Footnote_C2-79" class="fnanchor">C2-79</a></p>

<p>On the morning of November 22, President Kennedy attended a
breakfast at the hotel and afterward addressed a crowd at an open
parking lot.<a id="FNanchor_C2-80" href="#Footnote_C2-80" class="fnanchor">C2-80</a> The President liked outdoor appearances because more
people could see and hear him.<a id="FNanchor_C2-81" href="#Footnote_C2-81" class="fnanchor">C2-81</a> Before leaving the hotel, the President,
Mrs. Kennedy, and Kenneth O’Donnell talked about the risks
inherent in Presidential public appearances.<a id="FNanchor_C2-82" href="#Footnote_C2-82" class="fnanchor">C2-82</a> According to O’Donnell,
the President commented that “if anybody really wanted to shoot
the President of the United States, it was not a very difficult job—all
one had to do was get a high building someday with a telescopic rifle,
and there was nothing anybody could do to defend against such an
attempt.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-83" href="#Footnote_C2-83" class="fnanchor">C2-83</a> Upon concluding the conversation, the President prepared
to depart for Dallas.</p>

<h3 id="hdr15">ARRIVAL AT LOVE FIELD</h3>

<p>In Dallas the rain had stopped, and by midmorning a gloomy overcast
sky had given way to the bright sunshine that greeted the Presidential
party when <i>Air Force One</i> touched down at Love Field at 11:40
a.m., c.s.t.<a id="FNanchor_C2-84" href="#Footnote_C2-84" class="fnanchor">C2-84</a> Governor and Mrs. Connally and Senator Ralph W.
Yarborough had come with the President from Fort Worth.<a id="FNanchor_C2-85" href="#Footnote_C2-85" class="fnanchor">C2-85</a> Vice
President Johnson’s airplane, <i>Air Force Two</i>, had arrived at Love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
Field at approximately 11:35 a.m., and the Vice President and Mrs.
Johnson were in the receiving line to greet President and Mrs.
Kennedy.<a id="FNanchor_C2-86" href="#Footnote_C2-86" class="fnanchor">C2-86</a></p>

<p>After a welcome from the Dallas reception committee, President
and Mrs. Kennedy walked along a chain-link fence at the reception
area greeting a large crowd of spectators that had gathered behind
it.<a id="FNanchor_C2-87" href="#Footnote_C2-87" class="fnanchor">C2-87</a> Secret Service agents formed a cordon to keep the press and
photographers from impeding their passage and scanned the crowd
for threatening movements.<a id="FNanchor_C2-88" href="#Footnote_C2-88" class="fnanchor">C2-88</a> Dallas police stood at intervals along
the fence and Dallas plainclothesmen mixed in the crowd.<a id="FNanchor_C2-89" href="#Footnote_C2-89" class="fnanchor">C2-89</a> Vice
President and Mrs. Johnson followed along the fence, guarded by
four members of the Vice-Presidential detail.<a id="FNanchor_C2-90" href="#Footnote_C2-90" class="fnanchor">C2-90</a> Approximately 10
minutes after the arrival at Love Field, the President and Mrs. Kennedy
went to the Presidential automobile to begin the motorcade.<a id="FNanchor_C2-91" href="#Footnote_C2-91" class="fnanchor">C2-91</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr16">ORGANIZATION OF THE MOTORCADE</h3>

<p>Secret Service arrangements for Presidential trips, which were
followed in the Dallas motorcade, are designed to provide protection
while permitting large numbers of people to see the President.<a id="FNanchor_C2-92" href="#Footnote_C2-92" class="fnanchor">C2-92</a>
Every effort is made to prevent unscheduled stops, although the
President may, and in Dallas did, order stops in order to greet the
public.<a id="FNanchor_C2-93" href="#Footnote_C2-93" class="fnanchor">C2-93</a> When the motorcade slows or stops, agents take positions
between the President and the crowd.<a id="FNanchor_C2-94" href="#Footnote_C2-94" class="fnanchor">C2-94</a></p>

<p>The order of vehicles in the Dallas motorcade was as follows:</p>

<p><i>Motorcycles.</i>—Dallas police motorcycles preceded the pilot car.<a id="FNanchor_C2-95" href="#Footnote_C2-95" class="fnanchor">C2-95</a></p>

<p><i>The pilot car.</i>—Manned by officers of the Dallas Police Department,
this automobile preceded the main party by approximately a
quarter of a mile. Its function was to alert police along the route
that the motorcade was approaching and to check for signs of trouble.<a id="FNanchor_C2-96" href="#Footnote_C2-96" class="fnanchor">C2-96</a></p>

<p><i>Motorcycles.</i>—Next came four to six motorcycle policemen whose
main purpose was to keep the crowd back.<a id="FNanchor_C2-97" href="#Footnote_C2-97" class="fnanchor">C2-97</a></p>

<p><i>The lead car.</i>—Described as a “rolling command car,” this was
an unmarked Dallas police car, driven by Chief of Police Curry and
occupied by Secret Service Agents Sorrels and Lawson and by Dallas
County Sheriff J. E. Decker. The occupants scanned the crowd
and the buildings along the route. Their main function was to spot
trouble in advance and to direct any necessary steps to meet the
trouble. Following normal practice, the lead automobile stayed approximately
four to five car lengths ahead of the President’s
limousine.<a id="FNanchor_C2-98" href="#Footnote_C2-98" class="fnanchor">C2-98</a></p>

<p><i>The Presidential limousine.</i>—The President’s automobile was a
specially designed 1961 Lincoln convertible with two collapsible
jump seats between the front and rear seats.<a id="FNanchor_C2-99" href="#Footnote_C2-99" class="fnanchor">C2-99</a> (See Commission
Exhibit No. 346, <a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>.) It was outfitted with a clear plastic bubble-top
which was neither bulletproof nor bullet resistant.<a id="FNanchor_C2-100" href="#Footnote_C2-100" class="fnanchor">C2-100</a> Because
the skies had cleared in Dallas, Lawson directed that the top not be
used for the day’s activities. He acted on instructions he had received earlier from Assistant Special Agent in Charge Roy H. Kellerman,
who was in Fort Worth with the President.<a id="FNanchor_C2-101" href="#Footnote_C2-101" class="fnanchor">C2-101</a> Kellerman had
discussed the matter with O’Donnell, whose instructions were, “If the
weather is clear and it is not raining, have that bubbletop off.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-102" href="#Footnote_C2-102" class="fnanchor">C2-102</a>
Elevated approximately 15 inches above the back of the front seat was
a metallic frame with four handholds that riders in the car could
grip while standing in the rear seat during parades.<a id="FNanchor_C2-103" href="#Footnote_C2-103" class="fnanchor">C2-103</a> At the rear on
each side of the automobile were small running boards, each designed
to hold a Secret Service agent, with a metallic handle for the rider to
grasp.<a id="FNanchor_C2-104" href="#Footnote_C2-104" class="fnanchor">C2-104</a> The President had frequently stated that he did not want
agents to ride on these steps during a motorcade except when necessary.
He had repeated this wish only a few days before, during his
visit to Tampa, Fla.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span><a id="FNanchor_C2-105" href="#Footnote_C2-105" class="fnanchor">C2-105</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
President Kennedy rode on the right-hand side of the rear seat with
Mrs. Kennedy on his left.<a id="FNanchor_C2-106" href="#Footnote_C2-106" class="fnanchor">C2-106</a> Governor Connally occupied the right
jump seat, Mrs. Connally the left.<a id="FNanchor_C2-107" href="#Footnote_C2-107" class="fnanchor">C2-107</a> Driving the Presidential limousine
was Special Agent William R. Greer of the Secret Service; on
his right sat Kellerman.<a id="FNanchor_C2-108" href="#Footnote_C2-108" class="fnanchor">C2-108</a> Kellerman’s responsibilities included
maintaining radio communications with the lead and followup cars,
scanning the route, and getting out and standing near the President
when the cars stopped.</p>

<p><i>Motorcycles.</i>—Four motorcycles, two on each side, flanked the rear
of the Presidential car. They provided some cover for the President,
but their main purpose was to keep back the crowd.<a id="FNanchor_C2-109" href="#Footnote_C2-109" class="fnanchor">C2-109</a> On previous
occasions, the President had requested that, to the extent possible,
these flanking motorcycles keep back from the sides of his car.<a id="FNanchor_C2-110" href="#Footnote_C2-110" class="fnanchor">C2-110</a></p>

<p><i>Presidential followup car.</i>—This vehicle, a 1955 Cadillac eight-passenger
convertible especially outfitted for the Secret Service, followed
closely behind the President’s automobile.<a id="FNanchor_C2-111" href="#Footnote_C2-111" class="fnanchor">C2-111</a> It carried eight
Secret Service agents—two in the front seat, two in the rear, and two
on each of the right and left running boards.<a id="FNanchor_C2-112" href="#Footnote_C2-112" class="fnanchor">C2-112</a> Each agent carried a
.38-caliber pistol, and a shotgun and automatic rifle were also available.<a id="FNanchor_C2-113" href="#Footnote_C2-113" class="fnanchor">C2-113</a>
Presidential Assistants David F. Powers and Kenneth
O’Donnell sat in the right and left jump seats, respectively.<a id="FNanchor_C2-114" href="#Footnote_C2-114" class="fnanchor">C2-114</a></p>

<p>The agents in this car, under established procedure, had instructions
to watch the route for signs of trouble, scanning not only the crowds
but the windows and roofs of buildings, overpasses, and crossings.<a id="FNanchor_C2-115" href="#Footnote_C2-115" class="fnanchor">C2-115</a>
They were instructed to watch particularly for thrown objects, sudden
actions in the crowd, and any movements toward the Presidential
car.<a id="FNanchor_C2-116" href="#Footnote_C2-116" class="fnanchor">C2-116</a> The agents on the front of the running boards had directions
to move immediately to positions just to the rear of the President
and Mrs. Kennedy when the President’s car slowed to a walking pace
or stopped, or when the press of the crowd made it impossible for
the escort motorcycles to stay in position on the car’s rear flanks.<a id="FNanchor_C2-117" href="#Footnote_C2-117" class="fnanchor">C2-117</a>
The two agents on the rear of the running boards were to advance
toward the front of the President’s car whenever it stopped or slowed
down sufficiently for them to do so.<a id="FNanchor_C2-118" href="#Footnote_C2-118" class="fnanchor">C2-118</a></p>

<p><i>Vice-Presidential car.</i>—The Vice-Presidential automobile, a four-door
Lincoln convertible obtained locally for use in the motorcade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
proceeded approximately two to three car lengths behind the
President’s followup car.<a id="FNanchor_C2-119" href="#Footnote_C2-119" class="fnanchor">C2-119</a> This distance was maintained so that
spectators would normally turn their gaze from the President’s automobile
by the time the Vice President came into view.<a id="FNanchor_C2-120" href="#Footnote_C2-120" class="fnanchor">C2-120</a> Vice President
Johnson sat on the right-hand side of the rear seat, Mrs. Johnson
in the center, and Senator Yarborough on the left.<a id="FNanchor_C2-121" href="#Footnote_C2-121" class="fnanchor">C2-121</a> Rufus W.
Youngblood, special agent in charge of the Vice President’s detail,
occupied the right-hand side of the front seat, and Hurchel Jacks of
the Texas State Highway patrol was the driver.<a id="FNanchor_C2-122" href="#Footnote_C2-122" class="fnanchor">C2-122</a></p>

<p><i>Vice-Presidential followup car.</i>—Driven by an officer of the Dallas
Police Department, this vehicle was occupied by three Secret Service
agents and Clifton C. Carter, assistant to the Vice President.<a id="FNanchor_C2-123" href="#Footnote_C2-123" class="fnanchor">C2-123</a> These
agents performed for the Vice President the same functions that the
agents in the Presidential followup car performed for the President.</p>

<p><i>Remainder of motorcade.</i>—The remainder of the motorcade consisted
of five cars for other dignitaries, including the mayor of Dallas
and Texas Congressmen, telephone and Western Union vehicles, a
White House communications car, three cars for press photographers,
an official party bus for White House staff members and others, and
two press buses. Admiral George G. Burkley, physician to the President,
was in a car following those “containing the local and national
representatives.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-124" href="#Footnote_C2-124" class="fnanchor">C2-124</a></p>

<p><i>Police car and motorcycles.</i><a id="FNanchor_C2-125" href="#Footnote_C2-125" class="fnanchor">C2-125</a>—A Dallas police car and several
motorcycles at the rear kept the motorcade together and prevented
unauthorized vehicles from joining the motorcade.</p>

<p><i>Communications in the motorcade.</i><a id="FNanchor_C2-126" href="#Footnote_C2-126" class="fnanchor">C2-126</a>—A base station at a fixed location
in Dallas operated a radio network which linked together the
lead car, Presidential car, Presidential followup car, White House
communications car, Trade Mart, Love Field, and the Presidential
and Vice-Presidential airplanes. The Vice-Presidential car and
Vice-Presidential followup car used portable sets with a separate frequency
for their own car-to-car communication.</p>

<h3 id="hdr17">THE DRIVE THROUGH DALLAS</h3>

<p>The motorcade left Love Field shortly after 11:50 a.m. and drove
at speeds up to 25 to 30 miles an hour through thinly populated areas
on the outskirts of Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C2-127" href="#Footnote_C2-127" class="fnanchor">C2-127</a> At the President’s direction, his automobile
stopped twice, the first time to permit him to respond to a sign
asking him to shake hands.<a id="FNanchor_C2-128" href="#Footnote_C2-128" class="fnanchor">C2-128</a> During this brief stop, agents in the
front positions on the running boards of the Presidential followup
car came forward and stood beside the President’s car, looking out
toward the crowd, and Special Agent Kellerman assumed his position
next to the car.<a id="FNanchor_C2-129" href="#Footnote_C2-129" class="fnanchor">C2-129</a> On the other occasion, the President halted
the motorcade to speak to a Catholic nun and a group of small
children.<a id="FNanchor_C2-130" href="#Footnote_C2-130" class="fnanchor">C2-130</a></p>

<p>In the downtown area, large crowds of spectators gave the
President a tremendous reception.<a id="FNanchor_C2-131" href="#Footnote_C2-131" class="fnanchor">C2-131</a> The crowds were so dense
that Special Agent Clinton J. Hill had to leave the left front
running board of the President’s followup car four times to ride
on the rear of the President’s limousine.<a id="FNanchor_C2-132" href="#Footnote_C2-132" class="fnanchor">C2-132</a> (See Commission Exhibit
No. 698, <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>.) Several times Special Agent John D. Ready came
forward from the right front running board of the Presidential
followup car to the right side of the President’s car.<a id="FNanchor_C2-133" href="#Footnote_C2-133" class="fnanchor">C2-133</a> Special Agent
Glen A. Bennett once left his place inside the followup car to help
keep the crowd away from the President’s car. When a teenage
boy ran toward the rear of the President’s car,<a id="FNanchor_C2-134" href="#Footnote_C2-134" class="fnanchor">C2-134</a> Ready left the running

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
According to plan, the President’s motorcade proceeded west
through downtown Dallas on Main Street to the intersection of
Houston Street, which marks the beginning of Dealey Plaza.<a id="FNanchor_C2-136" href="#Footnote_C2-136" class="fnanchor">C2-136</a> From
Main Street the motorcade turned right and went north on Houston
Street, passing tall buildings on the right, and headed toward the
Texas School Book Depository Building.<a id="FNanchor_C2-137" href="#Footnote_C2-137" class="fnanchor">C2-137</a> The spectators were still
thickly congregated in front of the buildings which lined the east side
of Houston Street, but the crowd thinned abruptly along Elm Street,
which curves in a southwesterly direction as it proceeds downgrade
toward the Triple Underpass and the Stemmons Freeway.<a id="FNanchor_C2-138" href="#Footnote_C2-138" class="fnanchor">C2-138</a></p>

<p>As the motorcade approached the intersection of Houston and Elm
Streets, there was general gratification in the Presidential party about
the enthusiastic reception. Evaluating the political overtones,
Kenneth O’Donnell was especially pleased because it convinced him
that the average Dallas resident was like other American citizens in
respecting and admiring the President.<a id="FNanchor_C2-139" href="#Footnote_C2-139" class="fnanchor">C2-139</a> Mrs. Connally, elated by
the reception, turned to President Kennedy and said, “Mr. President,
you can’t say Dallas doesn’t love you.” The President replied, “That
is very obvious.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-140" href="#Footnote_C2-140" class="fnanchor">C2-140</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr18">THE ASSASSINATION</h3>

<p>At 12:30 p.m., c.s.t., as the President’s open limousine proceeded
at approximately 11 miles per hour along Elm Street toward the
Triple Underpass, shots fired from a rifle mortally wounded President
Kennedy and seriously injured Governor Connally. One bullet passed
through the President’s neck; a subsequent bullet, which was lethal,
shattered the right side of his skull. Governor Connally sustained
bullet wounds in his back, the right side of his chest, right wrist, and
left thigh.</p>

<h4 id="hdr19">The Time</h4>

<p>The exact time of the assassination was fixed by the testimony of
four witnesses. Special Agent Rufus W. Youngblood observed that
the large electric sign clock atop the Texas School Book Depository
Building showed the numerals “12:30” as the Vice-Presidential automobile
proceeded north on Houston Street, a few seconds before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
shots were fired.<a id="FNanchor_C2-141" href="#Footnote_C2-141" class="fnanchor">C2-141</a> Just prior to the shooting, David F. Powers, riding
in the Secret Service followup car, remarked to Kenneth O’Donnell
that it was 12:30 p.m., the time they were due at the Trade Mart.<a id="FNanchor_C2-142" href="#Footnote_C2-142" class="fnanchor">C2-142</a>
Seconds after the shooting, Roy Kellerman, riding in the front seat of
the Presidential limousine, looked at his watch and said “12:30” to
the driver, Special Agent Greer.<a id="FNanchor_C2-143" href="#Footnote_C2-143" class="fnanchor">C2-143</a> The Dallas police radio log reflects
that Chief of Police Curry reported the shooting of the President
and issued his initial orders at 12:30 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C2-144" href="#Footnote_C2-144" class="fnanchor">C2-144</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr20">Speed of the Limousine</h4>

<p>William Greer, operator of the Presidential limousine, estimated
the car’s speed at the time of the first shot as 12 to 15 miles per hour.<a id="FNanchor_C2-145" href="#Footnote_C2-145" class="fnanchor">C2-145</a>
Other witnesses in the motorcade estimated the speed of the President’s
limousine from 7 to 22 miles per hour.<a id="FNanchor_C2-146" href="#Footnote_C2-146" class="fnanchor">C2-146</a> A more precise determination
has been made from motion pictures taken on the scene
by an amateur photographer, Abraham Zapruder. Based on these
films, the speed of the President’s automobile is computed at an
average speed of 11.2 miles per hour. The car maintained this average
speed over a distance of approximately 136 feet immediately preceding
the shot which struck the President in the head. While the car
traveled this distance, the Zapruder camera ran 152 frames. Since
the camera operates at a speed of 18.3 frames per second, it was
calculated that the car required 8.3 seconds to cover the 136 feet.
This represents a speed of 11.2 miles per hour.<a id="FNanchor_C2-147" href="#Footnote_C2-147" class="fnanchor">C2-147</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr21">In the Presidential Limousine</h4>

<p>Mrs. John F. Kennedy, on the left of the rear seat of the limousine,
looked toward her left and waved to the crowds along the route.
Soon after the motorcade turned onto Elm Street, she heard a sound
similar to a motorcycle noise and a cry from Governor Connally,
which caused her to look to her right. On turning she saw a quizzical
look on her husband’s face as he raised his left hand to his throat.
Mrs. Kennedy then heard a second shot and saw the President’s skull
torn open under the impact of the bullet. As she cradled her mortally
wounded husband, Mrs. Kennedy cried, “Oh, my God, they have shot
my husband. I love you, Jack.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-148" href="#Footnote_C2-148" class="fnanchor">C2-148</a></p>

<p>Governor Connally testified that he recognized the first noise as a
rifle shot and the thought immediately crossed his mind that it was
an assassination attempt. From his position in the right jump seat
immediately in front of the President, he instinctively turned to his
right because the shot appeared to come from over his right shoulder.
Unable to see the President as he turned to the right, the Governor
started to look back over his left shoulder, but he never completed
the turn because he felt something strike him in the back.<a id="FNanchor_C2-149" href="#Footnote_C2-149" class="fnanchor">C2-149</a> In his
testimony before the Commission, Governor Connally was certain
that he was hit by the second shot, which he stated he did not hear.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span><a id="FNanchor_C2-150" href="#Footnote_C2-150" class="fnanchor">C2-150</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Connally, too, heard a frightening noise from her right. Looking
over her right shoulder, she saw that the President had both
hands at his neck but she observed no blood and heard nothing. She
watched as he slumped down with an empty expression on his face.<a id="FNanchor_C2-151" href="#Footnote_C2-151" class="fnanchor">C2-151</a>
Roy Kellerman, in the right front seat of the limousine, heard a
report like a firecracker pop. Turning to his right in the direction of
the noise, Kellerman heard the President say “My God, I am hit,” and
saw both of the President’s hands move up toward his neck. As he
told the driver, “Let’s get out of here; we are hit,” Kellerman grabbed
his microphone and radioed ahead to the lead car, “We are hit. Get
us to the hospital immediately.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-152" href="#Footnote_C2-152" class="fnanchor">C2-152</a></p>

<p>The driver, William Greer, heard a noise which he took to be a
backfire from one of the motorcycles flanking the Presidential car.
When he heard the same noise again, Greer glanced over his shoulder
and saw Governor Connally fall. At the sound of the second shot
he realized that something was wrong, and he pressed down on the accelerator
as Kellerman said, “Get out of here fast.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-153" href="#Footnote_C2-153" class="fnanchor">C2-153</a> As he issued his
instructions to Greer and to the lead car, Kellerman heard a “flurry
of shots” within 5 seconds of the first noise. According to Kellerman,
Mrs. Kennedy then cried out: “What are they doing to you?” Looking
back from the front seat, Kellerman saw Governor Connally in
his wife’s lap and Special Agent Clinton J. Hill lying across the
trunk of the car.<a id="FNanchor_C2-154" href="#Footnote_C2-154" class="fnanchor">C2-154</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Connally heard a second shot fired and pulled her husband
down into her lap.<a id="FNanchor_C2-155" href="#Footnote_C2-155" class="fnanchor">C2-155</a> Observing his blood-covered chest as he was
pulled into his wife’s lap, Governor Connally believed himself mortally
wounded. He cried out, “Oh, no, no, no. My God, they are going to
kill us all.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-156" href="#Footnote_C2-156" class="fnanchor">C2-156</a> At first Mrs. Connally thought that her husband had
been killed, but then she noticed an almost imperceptible movement
and knew that he was still alive. She said, “It’s all right. Be still.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-157" href="#Footnote_C2-157" class="fnanchor">C2-157</a>
The Governor was lying with his head on his wife’s lap when he heard
a shot hit the President.<a id="FNanchor_C2-158" href="#Footnote_C2-158" class="fnanchor">C2-158</a> At that point, both Governor and Mrs.
Connally observed brain tissue splattered over the interior of the
car.<a id="FNanchor_C2-159" href="#Footnote_C2-159" class="fnanchor">C2-159</a> According to Governor and Mrs. Connally, it was after this
shot that Kellerman issued his emergency instructions and the car
accelerated.<a id="FNanchor_C2-160" href="#Footnote_C2-160" class="fnanchor">C2-160</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr22">Reaction by Secret Service Agents</h4>

<p>From the left front running board of the President’s followup car,
Special Agent Hill was scanning the few people standing on the south
side of Elm Street after the motorcade had turned off Houston Street.
He estimated that the motorcade had slowed down to approximately
9 or 10 miles per hour on the turn at the intersection of Houston and
Elm Streets and then proceeded at a rate of 12 to 15 miles per hour
with the followup car trailing the President’s automobile by approximately
5 feet.<a id="FNanchor_C2-161" href="#Footnote_C2-161" class="fnanchor">C2-161</a> Hill heard a noise, which seemed to be a firecracker,
coming from his right rear. He immediately looked to his right, “and,
in so doing, my eyes had to cross the Presidential limousine and I saw
President Kennedy grab at himself and lurch forward and to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
left.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-162" href="#Footnote_C2-162" class="fnanchor">C2-162</a> Hill jumped from the followup car and ran to the President’s
automobile. At about the time he reached the President’s automobile,
Hill heard a second shot, approximately 5 seconds after the
first, which removed a portion of the President’s head.<a id="FNanchor_C2-163" href="#Footnote_C2-163" class="fnanchor">C2-163</a></p>

<p>At the instant that Hill stepped onto the left rear step of the President’s
automobile and grasped the handhold, the car lurched forward,
causing him to lose his footing. He ran three or four steps, regained
his position and mounted the car. Between the time he originally
seized the handhold and the time he mounted the car, Hill recalled
<span class="locked">that—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy had jumped up from the seat and was, it appeared
to me, reaching for something coming off the right rear bumper
of the car, the right rear tail, when she noticed that I was trying
to climb on the car. She turned toward me and I grabbed her
and put her back in the back seat, crawled up on top of the back
seat and lay there.<a id="FNanchor_C2-164" href="#Footnote_C2-164" class="fnanchor">C2-164</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">David Powers, who witnessed the scene from the President’s followup
car, stated that Mrs. Kennedy would probably have fallen off the rear
end of the car and been killed if Hill had not pushed her back into
the Presidential automobile.<a id="FNanchor_C2-165" href="#Footnote_C2-165" class="fnanchor">C2-165</a> Mrs. Kennedy had no recollection of
climbing onto the back of the car.<a id="FNanchor_C2-166" href="#Footnote_C2-166" class="fnanchor">C2-166</a></p>

<p>Special Agent Ready, on the right front running board of the Presidential
followup car, heard noises that sounded like firecrackers and
ran toward the President’s limousine. But he was immediately called
back by Special Agent Emory P. Roberts, in charge of the followup
car, who did not believe that he could reach the President’s car at the
speed it was then traveling.<a id="FNanchor_C2-167" href="#Footnote_C2-167" class="fnanchor">C2-167</a> Special Agent George W. Hickey, Jr.,
in the rear seat of the Presidential followup car, picked up and cocked
an automatic rifle as he heard the last shot. At this point the cars
were speeding through the underpass and had left the scene of the
shooting, but Hickey kept the automatic weapon ready as the car
raced to the hospital.<a id="FNanchor_C2-168" href="#Footnote_C2-168" class="fnanchor">C2-168</a> Most of the other Secret Service agents in
the motorcade had drawn their sidearms.<a id="FNanchor_C2-169" href="#Footnote_C2-169" class="fnanchor">C2-169</a> Roberts noticed that the
Vice President’s car was approximately one-half block behind the
Presidential followup car at the time of the shooting and signaled for
it to move in closer.<a id="FNanchor_C2-170" href="#Footnote_C2-170" class="fnanchor">C2-170</a></p>

<p>Directing the security detail for the Vice President from the right
front seat of the Vice-Presidential car, Special Agent Youngblood
recalled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As we were beginning to go down this incline, all of a sudden there
was an explosive noise. I quickly observed unnatural movement
of crowds, like ducking or scattering, and quick movements in
the Presidential followup car. So I turned around and hit the
Vice President on the shoulder and hollered, get down, and then
looked around again and saw more of this movement, and so I
proceeded to go to the back seat and get on top of him.<a id="FNanchor_C2-171" href="#Footnote_C2-171" class="fnanchor">C2-171</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
Youngblood was not positive that he was in the rear seat before the
second shot, but thought it probable because of President Johnson’s
statement to that effect immediately after the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C2-172" href="#Footnote_C2-172" class="fnanchor">C2-172</a> President
Johnson emphasized Youngblood’s instantaneous reaction after
the first shot:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I was startled by the sharp report or explosion, but I had no
time to speculate as to its origin because Agent Youngblood
turned in a flash, immediately after the first explosion, hitting
me on the shoulder, and shouted to all of us in the back seat to
get down. I was pushed down by Agent Youngblood. Almost
in the same moment in which he hit or pushed me, he vaulted over
the back seat and sat on me. I was bent over under the weight
of Agent Youngblood’s body, toward Mrs. Johnson and Senator
Yarborough.<a id="FNanchor_C2-173" href="#Footnote_C2-173" class="fnanchor">C2-173</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Clifton C. Carter, riding in the Vice President’s followup car a short
distance behind, reported that Youngblood was in the rear seat using
his body to shield the Vice President before the second and third
shots were fired.<a id="FNanchor_C2-174" href="#Footnote_C2-174" class="fnanchor">C2-174</a></p>

<p>Other Secret Service agents assigned to the motorcade remained at
their posts during the race to the hospital. None stayed at the scene
of the shooting, and none entered the Texas School Book Depository
Building at or immediately after the shooting. Secret Service procedure
requires that each agent stay with the person being protected
and not be diverted unless it is necessary to accomplish the protective
assignment.<a id="FNanchor_C2-175" href="#Footnote_C2-175" class="fnanchor">C2-175</a> Forrest V. Sorrels, special agent in charge of the
Dallas office, was the first Secret Service agent to return to the scene
of the assassination, approximately 20 or 25 minutes after the shots
were fired.<a id="FNanchor_C2-176" href="#Footnote_C2-176" class="fnanchor">C2-176</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr23">PARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL</h3>

<h4 id="hdr24">The Race to the Hospital</h4>

<p>In the final instant of the assassination, the Presidential motorcade
began a race to Parkland Memorial Hospital, approximately 4 miles
from the Texas School Book Depository Building.<a id="FNanchor_C2-177" href="#Footnote_C2-177" class="fnanchor">C2-177</a> On receipt of the
radio message from Kellerman to the lead car that the President had
been hit, Chief of Police Curry and police motorcyclists at the head of
the motorcade led the way to the hospital.<a id="FNanchor_C2-178" href="#Footnote_C2-178" class="fnanchor">C2-178</a> Meanwhile, Chief Curry
ordered the police base station to notify Parkland Hospital that the
wounded President was en route.<a id="FNanchor_C2-179" href="#Footnote_C2-179" class="fnanchor">C2-179</a> The radio log of the Dallas Police
Department shows that at 12:30 p.m. on November 22 Chief Curry
radioed, “Go to the hospital—Parkland Hospital. Have them stand
by.” A moment later Curry added, “Looks like the President has been
hit. Have Parkland stand by.” The base station replied, “They have
been notified.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-180" href="#Footnote_C2-180" class="fnanchor">C2-180</a> Traveling at speeds estimated at times to be up to 70
or 80 miles per hour down the Stemmons Freeway and Harry Hines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Boulevard, the Presidential limousine arrived at the emergency entrance
of the Parkland Hospital at about 12:35 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C2-181" href="#Footnote_C2-181" class="fnanchor">C2-181</a> Arriving almost
simultaneously were the President’s followup car, the Vice President’s
automobile, and the Vice President’s followup car. Admiral
Burkley, the President’s physician, arrived at the hospital “between
3 and 5 minutes following the arrival of the President,” since the riders
in his car “were not exactly aware what had happened” and the car
went on to the Trade Mart first.<a id="FNanchor_C2-182" href="#Footnote_C2-182" class="fnanchor">C2-182</a></p>

<p>When Parkland Hospital received the notification, the staff in the
emergency area was alerted and trauma rooms 1 and 2 were prepared.<a id="FNanchor_C2-183" href="#Footnote_C2-183" class="fnanchor">C2-183</a>
These rooms were for the emergency treatment of acutely
ill or injured patients.<a id="FNanchor_C2-184" href="#Footnote_C2-184" class="fnanchor">C2-184</a> Although the first message mentioned an
injury only to President Kennedy, two rooms were prepared.<a id="FNanchor_C2-185" href="#Footnote_C2-185" class="fnanchor">C2-185</a> As
the President’s limousine sped toward the hospital, 12 doctors rushed
to the emergency area: surgeons, Drs. Malcolm O. Perry, Charles
R. Baxter, Robert N. McClelland, Ronald C. Jones; the chief neurologist,
Dr. William Kemp Clark; 4 anesthesiologists, Drs. Marion T.
Jenkins, Adolph H. Giesecke, Jr., Jackie H. Hunt, Gene C. Akin; a
urological surgeon, Dr Paul C. Peters; an oral surgeon, Dr. Don T.
Curtis; and a heart specialist, Dr. Fouad A. Bashour.<a id="FNanchor_C2-186" href="#Footnote_C2-186" class="fnanchor">C2-186</a></p>

<p>Upon arriving at Parkland Hospital, Lawson jumped from the lead
car and rushed into the emergency entrance, where he was met by hospital
staff members wheeling stretchers out to the automobile.<a id="FNanchor_C2-187" href="#Footnote_C2-187" class="fnanchor">C2-187</a>
Special Agent Hill removed his suit jacket and covered the President’s
head and upper chest to prevent the taking of photographs.<a id="FNanchor_C2-188" href="#Footnote_C2-188" class="fnanchor">C2-188</a> Governor
Connally, who had lost consciousness on the ride to the hospital,
regained consciousness when the limousine stopped abruptly at
the emergency entrance. Despite his serious wounds, Governor Connally
tried to get out of the way so that medical help could reach
the President. Although he was reclining in his wife’s arms, he
lurched forward in an effort to stand upright and get out of the car,
but he collapsed again. Then he experienced his first sensation of
pain, which became excruciating.<a id="FNanchor_C2-189" href="#Footnote_C2-189" class="fnanchor">C2-189</a> The Governor was lifted onto
a stretcher and taken into trauma room 2.<a id="FNanchor_C2-190" href="#Footnote_C2-190" class="fnanchor">C2-190</a> For a moment, Mrs.
Kennedy refused to release the President, whom she held in her lap,
but then Kellerman, Greer, and Lawson lifted the President onto
a stretcher and pushed it into trauma room 1.<a id="FNanchor_C2-191" href="#Footnote_C2-191" class="fnanchor">C2-191</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr25">Treatment of President Kennedy</h4>

<p>The first physician to see the President at Parkland Hospital was
Dr. Charles J. Carrico, a resident in general surgery.<a id="FNanchor_C2-192" href="#Footnote_C2-192" class="fnanchor">C2-192</a> Dr. Carrico
was in the emergency area, examining another patient, when he was
notified that President Kennedy was en route to the hospital.<a id="FNanchor_C2-193" href="#Footnote_C2-193" class="fnanchor">C2-193</a>
Approximately 2 minutes later, Dr. Carrico saw the President on his
back, being wheeled into the emergency area.<a id="FNanchor_C2-194" href="#Footnote_C2-194" class="fnanchor">C2-194</a> He noted that the
President was blue-white or ashen in color; had slow, spasmodic,
agonal respiration without any coordination; made no voluntary movements;
had his eyes open with the pupils dilated without any reaction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
to light; evidenced no palpable pulse; and had a few chest sounds
which were thought to be heart beats.<a id="FNanchor_C2-195" href="#Footnote_C2-195" class="fnanchor">C2-195</a> On the basis of these findings,
Dr. Carrico concluded that President Kennedy was still alive.<a id="FNanchor_C2-196" href="#Footnote_C2-196" class="fnanchor">C2-196</a></p>

<p>Dr. Carrico noted two wounds: a small bullet wound in the front
lower neck, and an extensive wound in the President’s head where a
sizable portion of the skull was missing.<a id="FNanchor_C2-197" href="#Footnote_C2-197" class="fnanchor">C2-197</a> He observed shredded
brain tissue and “considerable slow oozing” from the latter wound,
followed by “more profuse bleeding” after some circulation was established.<a id="FNanchor_C2-198" href="#Footnote_C2-198" class="fnanchor">C2-198</a>
Dr. Carrico felt the President’s back and determined that
there was no large wound there which would be an immediate threat
to life.<a id="FNanchor_C2-199" href="#Footnote_C2-199" class="fnanchor">C2-199</a> Observing the serious problems presented by the head
wound and inadequate respiration, Dr. Carrico directed his attention
to improving the President’s breathing.<a id="FNanchor_C2-200" href="#Footnote_C2-200" class="fnanchor">C2-200</a> He noted contusions, hematoma
to the right of the larynx, which was deviated slightly to the
left, and also ragged tissue which indicated a tracheal injury.<a id="FNanchor_C2-201" href="#Footnote_C2-201" class="fnanchor">C2-201</a> Dr.
Carrico inserted a cuffed endotracheal tube past the injury, inflated
the cuff, and connected it to a Bennett machine to assist in
respiration.<a id="FNanchor_C2-202" href="#Footnote_C2-202" class="fnanchor">C2-202</a></p>

<p>At that point, direction of the President’s treatment was undertaken
by Dr. Malcolm O. Perry, who arrived at trauma room 1 a few
moments after the President.<a id="FNanchor_C2-203" href="#Footnote_C2-203" class="fnanchor">C2-203</a> Dr. Perry noted the President’s back
brace as he felt for a femoral pulse, which he did not find.<a id="FNanchor_C2-204" href="#Footnote_C2-204" class="fnanchor">C2-204</a> Observing
that an effective airway had to be established if treatment was
to be effective, Dr. Perry performed a tracheotomy, which required
3 to 5 minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C2-205" href="#Footnote_C2-205" class="fnanchor">C2-205</a> While Dr. Perry was performing the tracheotomy,
Drs. Carrico and Ronald Jones made cutdowns on the President’s right
leg and left arm, respectively, to infuse blood and fluids into the circulatory
system.<a id="FNanchor_C2-206" href="#Footnote_C2-206" class="fnanchor">C2-206</a> Dr. Carrico treated the President’s known adrenal
insufficiency by administering hydrocortisone.<a id="FNanchor_C2-207" href="#Footnote_C2-207" class="fnanchor">C2-207</a> Dr. Robert N.
McClelland entered at that point and assisted Dr. Perry with the
tracheotomy.<a id="FNanchor_C2-208" href="#Footnote_C2-208" class="fnanchor">C2-208</a></p>

<p>Dr. Fouad Bashour, chief of cardiology, Dr. M. T. Jenkins, chief
of anesthesiology, and Dr. A. H. Giesecke, Jr., then joined in the
effort to revive the President.<a id="FNanchor_C2-209" href="#Footnote_C2-209" class="fnanchor">C2-209</a> When Dr. Perry noted free air and
blood in the President’s chest cavity, he asked that chest tubes be
inserted to allow for drainage of blood and air. Drs. Paul C. Peters
and Charles R. Baxter initiated these procedures.<a id="FNanchor_C2-210" href="#Footnote_C2-210" class="fnanchor">C2-210</a> As a result of
the infusion of liquids through the cutdowns, the cardiac massage,
and the airway, the doctors were able to maintain peripheral circulation
as monitored at the neck (carotid) artery and at the wrist
(radial) pulse. A femoral pulse was also detected in the President’s
leg.<a id="FNanchor_C2-211" href="#Footnote_C2-211" class="fnanchor">C2-211</a> While these medical efforts were in progress, Dr. Clark noted
some electrical activity on the cardiotachyscope attached to monitor
the President’s heart responses.<a id="FNanchor_C2-212" href="#Footnote_C2-212" class="fnanchor">C2-212</a> Dr. Clark, who most closely observed
the head wound, described a large, gaping wound in the right
rear part of the head, with substantial damage and exposure of brain
tissue, and a considerable loss of blood.<a id="FNanchor_C2-213" href="#Footnote_C2-213" class="fnanchor">C2-213</a> Dr. Clark did not see any
other hole or wound on the President’s head. According to Dr. Clark,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
the small bullet hole on the right rear of the President’s head discovered
during the subsequent autopsy “could have easily been hidden
in the blood and hair.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-214" href="#Footnote_C2-214" class="fnanchor">C2-214</a></p>

<p>In the absence of any neurological, muscular, or heart response,
the doctors concluded that efforts to revive the President were hopeless.<a id="FNanchor_C2-215" href="#Footnote_C2-215" class="fnanchor">C2-215</a>
This was verified by Admiral Burkley, the President’s physician,
who arrived at the hospital after emergency treatment was underway
and concluded that “my direct services to him at that moment
would have interfered with the action of the team which was in progress.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-216" href="#Footnote_C2-216" class="fnanchor">C2-216</a>
At approximately 1 p.m., after last rites were administered
to the President by Father Oscar L. Huber, Dr. Clark pronounced the
President dead. He made the official determination because the ultimate
cause of death, the severe head injury, was within his sphere
of specialization.<a id="FNanchor_C2-217" href="#Footnote_C2-217" class="fnanchor">C2-217</a> The time was fixed at 1 p.m., as an approximation,
since it was impossible to determine the precise moment when life
left the President.<a id="FNanchor_C2-218" href="#Footnote_C2-218" class="fnanchor">C2-218</a> President Kennedy could have survived the
neck injury, but the head wound was fatal.<a id="FNanchor_C2-219" href="#Footnote_C2-219" class="fnanchor">C2-219</a> From a medical viewpoint,
President Kennedy was alive when he arrived at Parkland
Hospital; the doctors observed that he had a heart beat and was making
some respiratory efforts.<a id="FNanchor_C2-220" href="#Footnote_C2-220" class="fnanchor">C2-220</a> But his condition was hopeless, and
the extraordinary efforts of the doctors to save him could not help
but to have been unavailing.</p>

<p>Since the Dallas doctors directed all their efforts to controlling the
massive bleeding caused by the head wound, and to reconstructing
an airway to his lungs, the President remained on his back throughout
his medical treatment at Parkland.<a id="FNanchor_C2-221" href="#Footnote_C2-221" class="fnanchor">C2-221</a> When asked why he did not
turn the President over, Dr. Carrico testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A. This man was in obvious extreme distress and any more
thorough inspection would have involved several minutes—well,
several—considerable time which at this juncture was not available.
A thorough inspection would have involved washing and
cleansing the back, and this is not practical in treating an acutely
injured patient. You have to determine which things, which are
immediately life threatening and cope with them, before attempting
to evaluate the full extent of the injuries.</p>

<p>Q. Did you ever have occasion to look at the President’s back?</p>

<p>A. No, sir. Before—well, in trying to treat an acutely injured
patient, you have to establish an airway, adequate ventilation
and you have to establish adequate circulation. Before this was
accomplished the President’s cardiac activity had ceased and
closed cardiac massage was instituted, which made it impossible
to inspect his back.</p>

<p>Q. Was any effort made to inspect the President’s back after
he had expired?</p>

<p>A. No, sir.</p>

<p>Q. And why was no effort made at that time to inspect his back?</p>

<p>A. I suppose nobody really had the heart to do it.<a id="FNanchor_C2-222" href="#Footnote_C2-222" class="fnanchor">C2-222</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Moreover, the Parkland doctors took no further action after the President
had expired because they concluded that it was beyond the scope
of their permissible duties.<a id="FNanchor_C2-223" href="#Footnote_C2-223" class="fnanchor">C2-223</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr26">Treatment of Governor Connally</h4>

<p>While one medical team tried to revive President Kennedy, a second
performed a series of operations on the bullet wounds sustained by
Governor Connally.<a id="FNanchor_C2-224" href="#Footnote_C2-224" class="fnanchor">C2-224</a> Governor Connally was originally seen by Dr.
Carrico and Dr. Richard Dulany.<a id="FNanchor_C2-225" href="#Footnote_C2-225" class="fnanchor">C2-225</a> While Dr. Carrico went on to
attend the President, Dr. Dulany stayed with the Governor and was
soon joined by several other doctors.<a id="FNanchor_C2-226" href="#Footnote_C2-226" class="fnanchor">C2-226</a> At approximately 12:45 p.m.,
Dr. Robert Shaw, chief of thoracic surgery, arrived at trauma room 2,
to take charge of the care of Governor Connally, whose major wound
fell within Dr. Shaw’s area of specialization.<a id="FNanchor_C2-227" href="#Footnote_C2-227" class="fnanchor">C2-227</a></p>

<p>Governor Connally had a large sucking wound in the front of the
right chest which caused extreme pain and difficulty in breathing.
Rubber tubes were inserted between the second and third ribs to
reexpand the right lung, which had collapsed because of the opening
in the chest wall.<a id="FNanchor_C2-228" href="#Footnote_C2-228" class="fnanchor">C2-228</a> At 1:35 p.m., after Governor Connally had been
moved to the operating room, Dr. Shaw started the first operation
by cutting away the edges of the wound on the front of the Governor’s
chest and suturing the damaged lung and lacerated muscles.<a id="FNanchor_C2-229" href="#Footnote_C2-229" class="fnanchor">C2-229</a>
The elliptical wound in the Governor’s back, located slightly to the
left of the Governor’s right armpit approximately five-eighths inch
(a centimeter and a half) in its greatest diameter, was treated by cutting
away the damaged skin and suturing the back muscle and skin.<a id="FNanchor_C2-230" href="#Footnote_C2-230" class="fnanchor">C2-230</a>
This operation was concluded at 3:20 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C2-231" href="#Footnote_C2-231" class="fnanchor">C2-231</a></p>

<p>Two additional operations were performed on Governor Connally
for wounds which he had not realized he had sustained until he regained
consciousness the following day.<a id="FNanchor_C2-232" href="#Footnote_C2-232" class="fnanchor">C2-232</a> From approximately 4 p.m.
to 4:50 p.m. on November 22, Dr. Charles F. Gregory, chief of orthopedic
surgery, operated on the wounds of Governor Connally’s right
wrist, assisted by Drs. William Osborne and John Parker.<a id="FNanchor_C2-233" href="#Footnote_C2-233" class="fnanchor">C2-233</a> The
wound on the back of the wrist was left partially open for draining,
and the wound on the palm side was enlarged, cleansed, and closed.
The fracture was set, and a cast was applied with some traction utilized.<a id="FNanchor_C2-234" href="#Footnote_C2-234" class="fnanchor">C2-234</a>
While the second operation was in progress, Dr. George T.
Shires, assisted by Drs. Robert McClelland, Charles Baxter, and Ralph
Don Patman, treated the gunshot wound in the left thigh.<a id="FNanchor_C2-235" href="#Footnote_C2-235" class="fnanchor">C2-235</a> This
punctuate missile wound, about two-fifths inch in diameter (1 centimeter)
and located approximately 5 inches above the left knee, was
cleansed and closed with sutures; but a small metallic fragment remained
in the Governor’s leg.<a id="FNanchor_C2-236" href="#Footnote_C2-236" class="fnanchor">C2-236</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr27">Vice President Johnson at Parkland</h4>

<p>As President Kennedy and Governor Connally were being removed
from the limousine onto stretchers, a protective circle of Secret Service
agents surrounded Vice President and Mrs. Johnson and escorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
them into Parkland Hospital through the emergency entrance.<a id="FNanchor_C2-237" href="#Footnote_C2-237" class="fnanchor">C2-237</a> The
agents moved a nurse and patient out of a nearby room, lowered the
shades, and took emergency security measures to protect the Vice
President.<a id="FNanchor_C2-238" href="#Footnote_C2-238" class="fnanchor">C2-238</a> Two men from the President’s followup car were detailed
to help protect the Vice President. An agent was stationed
at the entrance to stop anyone who was not a member of the Presidential
party. U.S. Representatives Henry B. Gonzalez, Jack Brooks,
Homer Thornberry, and Albert Thomas joined Clifton C. Carter and
the group of special agents protecting the Vice President.<a id="FNanchor_C2-239" href="#Footnote_C2-239" class="fnanchor">C2-239</a> On one
occasion Mrs. Johnson, accompanied by two Secret Service agents,
left the room to see Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Connally.<a id="FNanchor_C2-240" href="#Footnote_C2-240" class="fnanchor">C2-240</a></p>

<p>Concern that the Vice President might also be a target for assassination
prompted the Secret Service agents to urge him to leave the
hospital and return to Washington immediately.<a id="FNanchor_C2-241" href="#Footnote_C2-241" class="fnanchor">C2-241</a> The Vice President
decided to wait until he received definitive word of the President’s
condition.<a id="FNanchor_C2-242" href="#Footnote_C2-242" class="fnanchor">C2-242</a> At approximately 1:20 p.m., Vice President Johnson
was notified by O’Donnell that President Kennedy was dead.<a id="FNanchor_C2-243" href="#Footnote_C2-243" class="fnanchor">C2-243</a> Special
Agent Youngblood learned from Mrs. Johnson the location of her
two daughters and made arrangements through Secret Service
headquarters in Washington to provide them with protection
immediately.<a id="FNanchor_C2-244" href="#Footnote_C2-244" class="fnanchor">C2-244</a></p>

<p>When consulted by the Vice President, O’Donnell advised him to go
to the airfield immediately and return to Washington.<a id="FNanchor_C2-245" href="#Footnote_C2-245" class="fnanchor">C2-245</a> It was decided
that the Vice President should return on the Presidential plane
rather than on the Vice-Presidential plane because it had better communication
equipment.<a id="FNanchor_C2-246" href="#Footnote_C2-246" class="fnanchor">C2-246</a> The Vice President conferred with White
House Assistant Press Secretary Malcolm Kilduff and decided that
there would be no release of the news of the President’s death until the
Vice President had left the hospital.<a id="FNanchor_C2-247" href="#Footnote_C2-247" class="fnanchor">C2-247</a> When told that Mrs. Kennedy
refused to leave without the President’s body, the Vice President
said that he would not leave Dallas without her.<a id="FNanchor_C2-248" href="#Footnote_C2-248" class="fnanchor">C2-248</a> On the recommendation
of the Secret Service agents, Vice President Johnson decided to
board the Presidential airplane, <i>Air Force One</i>, and wait for Mrs.
Kennedy and the President’s body.<a id="FNanchor_C2-249" href="#Footnote_C2-249" class="fnanchor">C2-249</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr28">Secret Service Emergency Security Arrangements</h4>

<p>Immediately after President Kennedy’s stretcher was wheeled into
trauma room 1, Secret Service agents took positions at the door of the
small emergency room. A nurse was asked to identify hospital personnel
and to tell everyone, except necessary medical staff members, to
leave the emergency room. Other Secret Service agents posted themselves
in the corridors and other areas near the emergency room. Special
Agent Lawson made certain that the Dallas police kept the public
and press away from the immediate area of the hospital.<a id="FNanchor_C2-250" href="#Footnote_C2-250" class="fnanchor">C2-250</a> Agents
Kellerman and Hill telephoned the head of the White House detail,
Gerald A. Behn, to advise him of the assassination. The telephone
line to Washington was kept open throughout the remainder of the
stay at the hospital.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span><a id="FNanchor_C2-251" href="#Footnote_C2-251" class="fnanchor">C2-251</a></p>

<p>Secret Service agents stationed at later stops on the President’s
itinerary of November 22 were redeployed. Men at the Trade Mart
were driven to Parkland Hospital in Dallas police cars.<a id="FNanchor_C2-252" href="#Footnote_C2-252" class="fnanchor">C2-252</a> The Secret
Service group awaiting the President in Austin were instructed to return
to Washington.<a id="FNanchor_C2-253" href="#Footnote_C2-253" class="fnanchor">C2-253</a> Meanwhile, the Secret Service agents in
charge of security at Love Field started to make arrangements for
departure. As soon as one of the agents learned of the shooting, he
asked the officer in charge of the police detail at the airport to institute
strict security measures for the Presidential aircraft, the airport terminal,
and the surrounding area. The police were cautioned to prevent
picture taking. Secret Service agents working with police
cleared the areas adjacent to the aircraft, including warehouses,
other terminal buildings and the neighboring parking lots, of all
people.<a id="FNanchor_C2-254" href="#Footnote_C2-254" class="fnanchor">C2-254</a> The agents decided not to shift the Presidential aircraft to
the far side of the airport because the original landing area was secure
and a move would require new measures.<a id="FNanchor_C2-255" href="#Footnote_C2-255" class="fnanchor">C2-255</a></p>

<p>When security arrangements at the airport were complete, the
Secret Service made the necessary arrangements for the Vice President
to leave the hospital. Unmarked police cars took the Vice President
and Mrs. Johnson from Parkland Hospital to Love Field. Chief
Curry drove one automobile occupied by Vice President Johnson, U.S.
Representatives Thomas and Thornberry, and Special Agent Youngblood.
In another car Mrs. Johnson was driven to the airport accompanied
by Secret Service agents and Representative Brooks.
Motorcycle policemen who escorted the automobiles were requested by
the Vice President and Agent Youngblood not to use sirens. During
the drive Vice President Johnson, at Youngblood’s instruction, kept
below window level.<a id="FNanchor_C2-256" href="#Footnote_C2-256" class="fnanchor">C2-256</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr29">Removal of the President’s Body</h4>

<p>While the team of doctors at Parkland Hospital tried desperately to
save the life of President Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy alternated between
watching them and waiting outside.<a id="FNanchor_C2-257" href="#Footnote_C2-257" class="fnanchor">C2-257</a> After the President was pronounced
dead, O’Donnell tried to persuade Mrs. Kennedy to leave the
area, but she refused. She said that she intended to stay with her
husband.<a id="FNanchor_C2-258" href="#Footnote_C2-258" class="fnanchor">C2-258</a> A casket was obtained and the President’s body was prepared
for removal.<a id="FNanchor_C2-259" href="#Footnote_C2-259" class="fnanchor">C2-259</a> Before the body could be taken from the hospital,
two Dallas officials informed members of the President’s staff
that the body could not be removed from the city until an autopsy was
performed. Despite the protests of these officials, the casket was
wheeled out of the hospital, placed in an ambulance, and transported to
the airport shortly after 2 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C2-260" href="#Footnote_C2-260" class="fnanchor">C2-260</a> At approximately 2:15 p.m. the
casket was loaded, with some difficulty because of the narrow airplane
door, onto the rear of the Presidential plane where seats had been
removed to make room.<a id="FNanchor_C2-261" href="#Footnote_C2-261" class="fnanchor">C2-261</a> Concerned that the local officials might
try to prevent the plane’s departure, O’Donnell asked that the pilot
take off immediately. He was informed that takeoff would be delayed
until Vice President Johnson was sworn in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span><a id="FNanchor_C2-262" href="#Footnote_C2-262" class="fnanchor">C2-262</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr30">THE END OF THE TRIP</h3>

<h4 id="hdr31">Swearing in of the New President</h4>

<p>From the Presidential airplane, the Vice President telephoned Attorney
General Robert F. Kennedy, who advised that Mr. Johnson
take the Presidential oath of office before the plane left Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C2-263" href="#Footnote_C2-263" class="fnanchor">C2-263</a>
Federal Judge Sarah T. Hughes hastened to the plane to administer
the oath.<a id="FNanchor_C2-264" href="#Footnote_C2-264" class="fnanchor">C2-264</a> Members of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential
parties filled the central compartment of the plane to witness the
swearing in. At 2:38 p.m., c.s.t., Lyndon Baines Johnson took the
oath of office as the 36th President of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_C2-265" href="#Footnote_C2-265" class="fnanchor">C2-265</a> Mrs.
Kennedy and Mrs. Johnson stood at the side of the new President as
he took the oath of office.<a id="FNanchor_C2-266" href="#Footnote_C2-266" class="fnanchor">C2-266</a> Nine minutes later, the Presidential airplane
departed for Washington, D.C.<a id="FNanchor_C2-267" href="#Footnote_C2-267" class="fnanchor">C2-267</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr32">Return to Washington, D.C.</h4>

<p>On the return flight, Mrs. Kennedy sat with David Powers, Kenneth
O’Donnell, and Lawrence O’Brien.<a id="FNanchor_C2-268" href="#Footnote_C2-268" class="fnanchor">C2-268</a> At 5:58 p.m., e.s.t., <i>Air
Force One</i> landed at Andrews AFB, where President Kennedy had begun
his last trip only 31 hours before.<a id="FNanchor_C2-269" href="#Footnote_C2-269" class="fnanchor">C2-269</a> Detailed security arrangements
had been made by radio from the President’s plane on the
return flight.<a id="FNanchor_C2-270" href="#Footnote_C2-270" class="fnanchor">C2-270</a> The public had been excluded from the base, and
only Government officials and the press were permitted near the landing
area. Upon arrival, President Johnson made a brief statement
over television and radio. President and Mrs. Johnson were flown
by helicopter to the White House, from where Mrs. Johnson was
driven to her residence under Secret Service escort. The President
then walked to the Executive Office Building, where he worked until
9 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C2-271" href="#Footnote_C2-271" class="fnanchor">C2-271</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr33">The Autopsy</h4>

<p>Given a choice between the National Naval Medical Center at
Bethesda, Md., and the Army’s Walter Reed Hospital, Mrs. Kennedy
chose the hospital in Bethesda for the autopsy because the President
had served in the Navy.<a id="FNanchor_C2-272" href="#Footnote_C2-272" class="fnanchor">C2-272</a> Mrs. Kennedy and the Attorney General,
with three Secret Service agents, accompanied President Kennedy’s
body on the 45-minute automobile trip from Andrews AFB
to the Hospital.<a id="FNanchor_C2-273" href="#Footnote_C2-273" class="fnanchor">C2-273</a> On the 17th floor of the Hospital, Mrs. Kennedy
and the Attorney General joined other members of the Kennedy family
to await the conclusion of the autopsy.<a id="FNanchor_C2-274" href="#Footnote_C2-274" class="fnanchor">C2-274</a> Mrs. Kennedy was guarded
by Secret Service agents in quarters assigned to her in the naval hospital.<a id="FNanchor_C2-275" href="#Footnote_C2-275" class="fnanchor">C2-275</a>
The Secret Service established a communication system with
the White House and screened all telephone calls and visitors.<a id="FNanchor_C2-276" href="#Footnote_C2-276" class="fnanchor">C2-276</a></p>

<p>The hospital received the President’s body for autopsy at approximately
7:35 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C2-277" href="#Footnote_C2-277" class="fnanchor">C2-277</a> X-rays and photographs were taken preliminarily
and the pathological examination began at about 8 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C2-278" href="#Footnote_C2-278" class="fnanchor">C2-278</a>
The autopsy report noted that President Kennedy was 46 years of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
age, 72½ inches tall, weighed 170 pounds, had blue eyes and
reddish-brown hair. The body was muscular and well developed
with no gross skeletal abnormalities except for those caused by the
gunshot wounds. Under “Pathological Diagnosis” the cause of
death was set forth as “Gunshot wound, head.”<a id="FNanchor_C2-279" href="#Footnote_C2-279" class="fnanchor">C2-279</a> (See <a href="#APPENDIX_IX">app. IX</a>.)</p>

<p>The autopsy examination revealed two wounds in the President’s
head. One wound, approximately one-fourth of an inch by five-eighths
of an inch (6 by 15 millimeters), was located about an inch
(2.5 centimeters) to the right and slightly above the large bony protrusion
(external occipital protuberance) which juts out at the center
of the lower part of the back of the skull. The second head wound
measured approximately 5 inches (13 centimeters) in its greatest diameter,
but it was difficult to measure accurately because multiple
crisscross fractures radiated from the large defect.<a id="FNanchor_C2-280" href="#Footnote_C2-280" class="fnanchor">C2-280</a> During the autopsy
examination, Federal agents brought the surgeons three pieces
of bone recovered from Elm Street and the Presidential automobile.
When put together, these fragments accounted for approximately
three-quarters of the missing portion of the skull.<a id="FNanchor_C2-281" href="#Footnote_C2-281" class="fnanchor">C2-281</a> The surgeons
observed, through X-ray analysis, 30 or 40 tiny dustlike fragments of
metal running in a line from the wound in the rear of the President’s
head toward the front part of the skull, with a sizable metal fragment
lying just above the right eye.<a id="FNanchor_C2-282" href="#Footnote_C2-282" class="fnanchor">C2-282</a> From this head wound two small
irregularly shaped fragments of metal were recovered and turned over
to the FBI.<a id="FNanchor_C2-283" href="#Footnote_C2-283" class="fnanchor">C2-283</a></p>

<p>The autopsy also disclosed a wound near the base of the back of
President Kennedy’s neck slightly to the right of his spine. The
doctors traced the course of the bullet through the body and, as information
was received from Parkland Hospital, concluded that the
bullet had emerged from the front portion of the President’s neck that
had been cut away by the tracheotomy at Parkland.<a id="FNanchor_C2-284" href="#Footnote_C2-284" class="fnanchor">C2-284</a> The nature
and characteristics of this neck wound and the two head wounds are
discussed fully in the next chapter.</p>

<p>After the autopsy was concluded at approximately 11 p.m., the
President’s body was prepared for burial. This was finished at approximately
4 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_C2-285" href="#Footnote_C2-285" class="fnanchor">C2-285</a> Shortly thereafter, the President’s wife, family
and aides left Bethesda Naval Hospital.<a id="FNanchor_C2-286" href="#Footnote_C2-286" class="fnanchor">C2-286</a> The President’s body was
taken to the East Room of the White House where it was placed under

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> this chapter the Commission analyzes the evidence and sets
forth its conclusions concerning the source, effect, number and
timing of the shots that killed President Kennedy and wounded
Governor Connally. In that connection the Commission has evaluated
(1) the testimony of eyewitnesses present at the scene of the
assassination; (2) the damage to the Presidential limousine; (3) the
examination by qualified experts of the rifle and cartridge cases found
on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository and the bullet
fragments found in the Presidential limousine and at Parkland Hospital;
(4) the wounds suffered by President Kennedy and Governor
Connally; (5) wound ballistics tests; (6) the examination by qualified
experts of the clothing worn by President Kennedy and Governor
Connally; and (7) motion-picture films and still photographs taken
at the time of the assassination.</p>

<h3 id="hdr35">THE WITNESSES</h3>

<p>As reflected in the previous chapter, passengers in the first few cars
of the motorcade had the impression that the shots came from the rear
and from the right, the general direction of the Texas School Book
Depository Building, although none of these passengers saw anyone
fire the shots. Some spectators at Houston and Elm Streets, however,
did see a rifle being fired in the direction of the President’s car
from the easternmost window of the sixth floor on the south side of the
building. Other witnesses saw a rifle in this window immediately
after the assassination. Three employees of the Depository, observing
the parade from the fifth floor, heard the shots fired from the floor
immediately above them. No credible evidence suggests that the
shots were fired from the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass,
the nearby railroad yards or any place other than the Texas School
Book Depository Building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<h4 id="hdr36">Near the Depository</h4>

<p>Eyewitnesses testified that they saw a man fire a weapon from the
sixth-floor window. Howard L. Brennan, a 45-year-old steamfitter,
watched the motorcade from a concrete retaining wall at the southwest
corner of Elm and Houston, where he had a clear view of the south
side of the Depository Building.<a id="FNanchor_C3-1" href="#Footnote_C3-1" class="fnanchor">C3-1</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 477,
<a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>.) He was approximately 107 feet from the Depository entrance
and 120 feet from the southeast corner window of the sixth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C3-2" href="#Footnote_C3-2" class="fnanchor">C3-2</a>
Brennan’s presence and vantage point are corroborated by a motion
picture of the motorcade taken by amateur photographer Abraham
Zapruder, which shows Brennan, wearing gray khaki work clothes and
a gray work helmet, seated on the retaining wall.<a id="FNanchor_C3-3" href="#Footnote_C3-3" class="fnanchor">C3-3</a> Brennan later
identified himself in the Zapruder movie.<a id="FNanchor_C3-4" href="#Footnote_C3-4" class="fnanchor">C3-4</a> While waiting about 7
minutes for the President to arrive, he observed the crowd on the
street and the people at the windows of the Depository Building.<a id="FNanchor_C3-5" href="#Footnote_C3-5" class="fnanchor">C3-5</a>
He noticed a man at the southeast corner window of the sixth floor,
and observed him leave the window “a couple of times.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-6" href="#Footnote_C3-6" class="fnanchor">C3-6</a></p>

<p>Brennan watched the President’s car as it turned the corner at
Houston and Elm and moved down the incline toward the Triple
Underpass. Soon after the President’s car passed, he heard an
explosion like the backfire of a motorcycle.<a id="FNanchor_C3-7" href="#Footnote_C3-7" class="fnanchor">C3-7</a> Brennan recalled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, then something, just right after this explosion, made me
think that it was a firecracker being thrown from the Texas Book
Store. And I glanced up. And this man that I saw previous
was aiming for his last shot.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Well, as it appeared to me he was standing up and resting
against the left window sill, with gun shouldered to his right
shoulder, holding the gun with his left hand and taking positive
aim and fired his last shot. As I calculate a couple of seconds.
He drew the gun back from the window as though he was drawing
it back to his side and maybe paused for another second as though
to assure hisself that he hit his mark, and then he disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_C3-8" href="#Footnote_C3-8" class="fnanchor">C3-8</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Brennan stated that he saw 70 to 85 percent of the gun when it was
fired and the body of the man from the waist up.<a id="FNanchor_C3-9" href="#Footnote_C3-9" class="fnanchor">C3-9</a> The rifle was aimed
southwesterly down Elm Street toward the underpass.<a id="FNanchor_C3-10" href="#Footnote_C3-10" class="fnanchor">C3-10</a> Brennan
saw the man fire one shot and he remembered hearing a total of only
two shots. When questioned about the number of shots, Brennan
testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don’t know what made me think that there was firecrackers
throwed out of the Book Store unless I did hear the second shot,
because I positively thought the first shot was a backfire, and
subconsciously I must have heard a second shot, but I do not
recall it. I could not swear to it.<a id="FNanchor_C3-11" href="#Footnote_C3-11" class="fnanchor">C3-11</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Brennan quickly reported his observations to police officers.<a id="FNanchor_C3-12" href="#Footnote_C3-12" class="fnanchor">C3-12</a> Brennan’s
description of the man he saw is discussed in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Amos Lee Euins, a 15-year-old ninth grade student, stated that he
was facing the Depository as the motorcade turned the corner at Elm
and Houston. He recalled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Then I was standing here, and as the motorcade turned the
corner, I was facing, looking dead at the building. And so I
seen this pipe thing sticking out the window. I wasn’t paying
too much attention to it. Then when the first shot was fired, I
started looking around, thinking it was a backfire. Everybody
else started looking around. Then I looked up at the window,
and he shot again.<a id="FNanchor_C3-13" href="#Footnote_C3-13" class="fnanchor">C3-13</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">After witnessing the first shots, Euins hid behind a fountain
bench and saw the man shoot again from the window in the southeast
corner of the Depository’s sixth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C3-14" href="#Footnote_C3-14" class="fnanchor">C3-14</a> According to Euins, the man
had one hand on the barrel and the other on the trigger. Euins believed
that there were four shots.<a id="FNanchor_C3-15" href="#Footnote_C3-15" class="fnanchor">C3-15</a> Immediately after the assassination,
he reported his observations to Sgt. D. V. Harkness of the
Dallas Police Department and also to James Underwood of station
KRLD-TV of Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C3-16" href="#Footnote_C3-16" class="fnanchor">C3-16</a> Sergeant Harkness testified that Euins told
him that the shots came from the last window of the floor “under the
ledge” on the side of the building they were facing.<a id="FNanchor_C3-17" href="#Footnote_C3-17" class="fnanchor">C3-17</a> Based on Euins’
statements, Harkness radioed to headquarters at 12:36 p.m. that
“I have a witness that says that it came from the fifth floor of the
Texas Book Depository Store.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-18" href="#Footnote_C3-18" class="fnanchor">C3-18</a> Euins accurately described the
sixth floor as the floor “under the ledge.” Harkness testified that the
error in the radio message was due to his own “hasty count of the
floors.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-19" href="#Footnote_C3-19" class="fnanchor">C3-19</a></p>

<p>Other witnesses saw a rifle in the window after the shots were fired.
Robert H. Jackson, staff photographer, Dallas Times Herald, was
in a press car in the Presidential motorcade, eight or nine cars from
the front. On Houston Street about halfway between Main and Elm,
Jackson heard the first shot.<a id="FNanchor_C3-20" href="#Footnote_C3-20" class="fnanchor">C3-20</a> As someone in the car commented that
it sounded like a firecracker, Jackson heard two more shots.<a id="FNanchor_C3-21" href="#Footnote_C3-21" class="fnanchor">C3-21</a> He
testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Then we realized or we thought that it was gunfire, and then
we could not at that point see the President’s car. We were
still moving slowly, and after the third shot the second two shots
seemed much closer together than the first shot, than they were
to the first shot. Then after the last shot, I guess all of us were
just looking all around and I just looked straight up ahead of
me which would have been looking at the School Book Depository
and I noticed two Negro men in a window straining to see directly
above them, and my eyes followed right on up to the window
above them and I saw the rifle or what looked like a rifle approximately
half of the weapon, I guess I saw, and just as I looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
at it, it was drawn fairly slowly back into the building, and I
saw no one in the window with it.</p>

<p>I didn’t even see a form in the window.<a id="FNanchor_C3-22" href="#Footnote_C3-22" class="fnanchor">C3-22</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In the car with Jackson were James Underwood, television station
KRLD-TV; Thomas Dillard, chief photographer, Dallas Morning
News; Malcolm O. Couch and James Darnell, television newsreel
cameramen. Dillard, Underwood, and the driver were in the front
seat, Couch and Darnell were sitting on top of the back seat of the
convertible with Jackson. Dillard, Couch, and Underwood confirmed
that Jackson spontaneously exclaimed that he saw a rifle in
the window.<a id="FNanchor_C3-23" href="#Footnote_C3-23" class="fnanchor">C3-23</a> According to Dillard, at the time the shots were fired
he and his fellow passengers “had an absolutely perfect view of the
School Depository from our position in the open car.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-24" href="#Footnote_C3-24" class="fnanchor">C3-24</a> Dillard
immediately took two pictures of the building: one of the east two-thirds
of the south side and the other of the southeast corner, particularly
the fifth- and sixth-floor windows.<a id="FNanchor_C3-25" href="#Footnote_C3-25" class="fnanchor">C3-25</a> These pictures show three
Negro men in windows on the fifth floor and the partially open
window on the sixth floor directly above them. (See Dillard Exhibits
C and D, <a href="#Page_66">pp. 66-67</a>.) Couch also saw the rifle in the window,
and testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And after the third shot, Bob Jackson, who was, as I recall, on
my right, yelled something like, “Look up in the window!
There’s the rifle!”</p>

<p>And I remember glancing up to a window on the far right,
which at the time impressed me as the sixth or seventh floor,
and seeing about a foot of a rifle being—the barrel brought into
the window.<a id="FNanchor_C3-26" href="#Footnote_C3-26" class="fnanchor">C3-26</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Couch testified he saw people standing in other windows on the third
or fourth floor in the middle of the south side, one of them being a
Negro in a white T-shirt leaning out to look up at the windows above
him.<a id="FNanchor_C3-27" href="#Footnote_C3-27" class="fnanchor">C3-27</a></p>

<p>Mayor and Mrs. Earle Cabell rode in the motorcade immediately
behind the Vice-Presidential followup car.<a id="FNanchor_C3-28" href="#Footnote_C3-28" class="fnanchor">C3-28</a> Mrs. Cabell was seated
in the back seat behind the driver and was facing U.S. Representative
Ray Roberts on her right as the car made the turn at Elm and Houston.
In this position Mrs. Cabell “was actually facing” the seven-story
Depository when the first shot rang out.<a id="FNanchor_C3-29" href="#Footnote_C3-29" class="fnanchor">C3-29</a> She “jerked” her head up
immediately and saw a “projection” in the first group of windows on
a floor which she described both as the sixth floor and the top floor.<a id="FNanchor_C3-30" href="#Footnote_C3-30" class="fnanchor">C3-30</a>
According to Mrs. Cabell, the object was “rather long looking,” but she
was unable to determine whether it was a mechanical object or a
person’s arm.<a id="FNanchor_C3-31" href="#Footnote_C3-31" class="fnanchor">C3-31</a> She turned away from the window to tell her husband
that the noise was a shot, and “just as I got the words out * * *
the second two shots rang out.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-32" href="#Footnote_C3-32" class="fnanchor">C3-32</a> Mrs. Cabell did not look at the
sixth-floor window when the second and third shots were fired.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span><a id="FNanchor_C3-33" href="#Footnote_C3-33" class="fnanchor">C3-33</a></p>

James N. Crawford and Mary Ann Mitchell, two deputy district
clerks for Dallas County, watched the motorcade at the southeast
corner of Elm and Houston. After the President’s car turned the
corner, Crawford heard a loud report which he thought was backfire
coming from the direction of the Triple Underpass.<a id="FNanchor_C3-34" href="#Footnote_C3-34" class="fnanchor">C3-34</a> He heard a
second shot seconds later, followed quickly by a third. At the third
shot, he looked up and saw a “movement” in the far east corner
of the sixth floor of the Depository, the only open window on that
floor.<a id="FNanchor_C3-35" href="#Footnote_C3-35" class="fnanchor">C3-35</a> He told Miss Mitchell “that if those were shots they came
from that window.” When asked to describe the movement more
exactly, he said,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * I would say that it was a profile, somewhat from the
waist up, but it was a very quick movement and rather indistinct
and it was very light colored. * * *</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>When I saw it, I automatically in my mind came to the conclusion
that it was a person having moved out of the window. * * *<a id="FNanchor_C3-36" href="#Footnote_C3-36" class="fnanchor">C3-36</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">He could not state whether the person was a man or a woman.<a id="FNanchor_C3-37" href="#Footnote_C3-37" class="fnanchor">C3-37</a> Miss
Mitchell confirmed that after the third shot Crawford told her, “Those
shots came from that building.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-38" href="#Footnote_C3-38" class="fnanchor">C3-38</a> She saw Crawford pointing at a
window but was not sure at which window he was pointing.<a id="FNanchor_C3-39" href="#Footnote_C3-39" class="fnanchor">C3-39</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr37">On the Fifth Floor</h4>

<p>Three Depository employees shown in the picture taken by Dillard
were on the fifth floor of the building when the shots were fired:
James Jarman, Jr., age 34, a wrapper in the shipping department;
Bonnie Ray Williams, age 20, a warehouseman temporarily assigned
to laying a plywood floor on the sixth floor; and Harold Norman, age
26, an “order filler.” Norman and Jarman decided to watch the
parade during the lunch hour from the fifth-floor windows.<a id="FNanchor_C3-40" href="#Footnote_C3-40" class="fnanchor">C3-40</a> From
the ground floor they took the west elevator, which operates with push-button
controls, to the fifth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C3-41" href="#Footnote_C3-41" class="fnanchor">C3-41</a> Meanwhile, Williams had gone up
to the sixth floor where he had been working and ate his lunch on the
south side of that floor. Since he saw no one around when he finished
his lunch, he started down on the east elevator, looking for company.
He left behind his paper lunch sack, chicken bones and an empty
pop bottle.<a id="FNanchor_C3-42" href="#Footnote_C3-42" class="fnanchor">C3-42</a> Williams went down to the fifth floor, where he joined
Norman and Jarman at approximately 12:20 pm.<a id="FNanchor_C3-43" href="#Footnote_C3-43" class="fnanchor">C3-43</a></p>

<p>Harold Norman was in the fifth-floor window in the southeast
corner, directly under the window where witnesses saw the rifle.
(See Commission Exhibit No. 485, <a href="#Page_69">p. 69</a>.) He could see light
through the ceiling cracks between the fifth and sixth floors.<a id="FNanchor_C3-44" href="#Footnote_C3-44" class="fnanchor">C3-44</a> As
the motorcade went by, Norman thought that the President was
saluting with his right arm,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * and I can’t remember what the exact time was but I know
I heard a shot, and then after I heard the shot, well, it seems
as though the President, you know, slumped or something, and
then another shot and I believe Jarman or someone told me, he
said, “I believe someone is shooting at the President,” and I
think I made a statement “It is someone shooting at the President,
and I believe it came from up above us.”</p>

<p>Well, I couldn’t see at all during the time but I know I heard
a third shot fired, and I could also hear something sounded like
the shell hulls hitting the floor and the ejecting of the rifle * * *.<a id="FNanchor_C3-45" href="#Footnote_C3-45" class="fnanchor">C3-45</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Williams said that he “really did not pay any attention” to the first
<span class="locked">shot—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * because I did not know what was happening. The second
shot, it sounded like it was right in the building, the second and
third shot. And it sounded—it even shook the building, the side
we were on. Cement fell on my head.</p>

<p>Q. You say cement fell on your head?</p>

<p>A. Cement, gravel, dirt, or something, from the old building,
because it shook the windows and everything. Harold was sitting
next to me, and he said it came right from over our head.<a id="FNanchor_C3-46" href="#Footnote_C3-46" class="fnanchor">C3-46</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Williams testified Norman said “I can even hear the shell being ejected
from the gun hitting the floor.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-47" href="#Footnote_C3-47" class="fnanchor">C3-47</a></p>

<p>When Jarman heard the first sound, he thought that it was either
a <span class="locked">backfire—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * or an officer giving a salute to the President. And then
at that time I didn’t, you know, think too much about it. * * *</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Well, after the third shot was fired, I think I got up and I run
over to Harold Norman and Bonnie Ray Williams, and told them,
I said, I told them that it wasn’t a backfire or anything, that
somebody was shooting at the President.<a id="FNanchor_C3-48" href="#Footnote_C3-48" class="fnanchor">C3-48</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Jarman testified that Norman said “that he thought the shots had come
from above us, and I noticed that Bonnie Ray had a few debris in his
head. It was sort of white stuff, or something.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-49" href="#Footnote_C3-49" class="fnanchor">C3-49</a> Jarman stated
that Norman said “that he was sure that the shot came from inside
the building because he had been used to guns and all that, and he
said it didn’t sound like it was too far off anyway.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-50" href="#Footnote_C3-50" class="fnanchor">C3-50</a> The three men
ran to the west side of the building, where they could look toward the
Triple Underpass to see what had happened to the motorcade.<a id="FNanchor_C3-51" href="#Footnote_C3-51" class="fnanchor">C3-51</a></p>

<p>After the men had gone to the window on the west side of the building,
Jarman “got to thinking about all the debris on Bonnie Ray’s
head” and said, “That shot probably did come from upstairs, up over
us.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-52" href="#Footnote_C3-52" class="fnanchor">C3-52</a> He testified that Norman said, “I know it did, because I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
hear the action of the bolt, and I could hear the cartridges drop on
the floor.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-53" href="#Footnote_C3-53" class="fnanchor">C3-53</a> After pausing for a few minutes, the three men ran
downstairs. Norman and Jarman ran out of the front entrance of the
building, where they saw Brennan, the construction worker who had
seen the man in the window firing the gun, talking to a police officer,
and they then reported their own experience.<a id="FNanchor_C3-54" href="#Footnote_C3-54" class="fnanchor">C3-54</a></p>

<p>On March 20, 1964, preceding their appearance before the Commission,
these witnesses were interviewed in Dallas. At that time
members of the Commission’s legal staff conducted an experiment.
Norman, Williams, and Jarman placed themselves at the windows of
the fifth floor as they had been on November 22. A Secret Service
agent operated the bolt of a rifle directly above them at the southeast
corner window of the sixth floor. At the same time, three cartridge
shells were dropped to the floor at intervals of about 3 seconds. According
to Norman, the noise outside was less on the day of the assassination
than on the day of the test.<a id="FNanchor_C3-55" href="#Footnote_C3-55" class="fnanchor">C3-55</a> He testified, “Well, I heard the
same sound, the sound similar. I heard three something that he
dropped on the floor and then I could hear the rifle or whatever he
had up there.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-56" href="#Footnote_C3-56" class="fnanchor">C3-56</a> The experiment with the shells and rifle was repeated
for members of the Commission on May 9, 1964, on June 7, 1964,
and again on September 6, 1964. All seven of the Commissioners
clearly heard the shells drop to the floor.</p>

<h4 id="hdr38">At the Triple Underpass</h4>

<p>In contrast to the testimony of the witnesses who heard and observed
shots fired from the Depository, the Commission’s investigation has
disclosed no credible evidence that any shots were fired from anywhere
else. When the shots were fired, many people near the Depository
believed that the shots came from the railroad bridge over the Triple
Underpass or from the area to the west of the Depository.<a id="FNanchor_C3-57" href="#Footnote_C3-57" class="fnanchor">C3-57</a> In the
hectic moments after the assassination, many spectators ran in the
general direction of the Triple Underpass or the railroad yards northwest
of the building. Some were running toward the place from
which the sound of the rifle fire appeared to come, others were fleeing
the scene of the shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C3-58" href="#Footnote_C3-58" class="fnanchor">C3-58</a> None of these people saw anyone with a
rifle, and the Commission’s inquiry has yielded no evidence that shots
were fired from the bridge over the Triple Underpass or from the
railroad yards.</p>

<p>On the day of the motorcade, Patrolman J. W. Foster stood on the
east side of the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass and
Patrolman J. C. White stood on the west side.<a id="FNanchor_C3-59" href="#Footnote_C3-59" class="fnanchor">C3-59</a> Patrolman Joe E.
Murphy was standing over Elm Street on the Stemmons Freeway
overpass, west of the railroad bridge farther away from the Depository.<a id="FNanchor_C3-60" href="#Footnote_C3-60" class="fnanchor">C3-60</a>
Two other officers were stationed on Stemmons Freeway
to control traffic as the motorcade entered the Freeway.<a id="FNanchor_C3-61" href="#Footnote_C3-61" class="fnanchor">C3-61</a> Under the
advance preparations worked out between the Secret Service and the
Dallas Police Department, the policemen were under instructions to
keep “unauthorized” people away from these locations.<a id="FNanchor_C3-62" href="#Footnote_C3-62" class="fnanchor">C3-62</a> When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
motorcade reached the intersection of Elm and Houston Streets, there
were no spectators on Stemmons Freeway where Patrolman Murphy
was stationed.<a id="FNanchor_C3-63" href="#Footnote_C3-63" class="fnanchor">C3-63</a> Patrolman Foster estimated that there were 10 or
11 people on the railroad bridge where he was assigned;<a id="FNanchor_C3-64" href="#Footnote_C3-64" class="fnanchor">C3-64</a> another
witness testified that there were between 14 and 18 people there as
the motorcade came into view.<a id="FNanchor_C3-65" href="#Footnote_C3-65" class="fnanchor">C3-65</a> Investigation has disclosed 15 persons
who were on the railroad bridge at this time, including 2 policemen,
2 employees of the Texas-Louisiana Freight Bureau and 11
employees of the Union Terminal Co.<a id="FNanchor_C3-66" href="#Footnote_C3-66" class="fnanchor">C3-66</a> In the absence of any explicit
definition of “unauthorized” persons, the policemen permitted these
employees to remain on the railroad bridge to watch the motorcade.
(See chapter VIII, <a href="#Page_446">pp. 446-447</a>.) At the request of the policemen,
S.M. Holland, signal supervisor for Union Terminal Co., came to the
railroad bridge at about 11:45 a.m. and remained to identify those
persons who were railroad employees.<a id="FNanchor_C3-67" href="#Footnote_C3-67" class="fnanchor">C3-67</a> In addition, Patrolman
Foster checked credentials to determine if persons seeking access to
the bridge were railroad employees.<a id="FNanchor_C3-68" href="#Footnote_C3-68" class="fnanchor">C3-68</a> Persons who were not railroad
employees were ordered away, including one news photographer who
wished only to take a picture of the motorcade.<a id="FNanchor_C3-69" href="#Footnote_C3-69" class="fnanchor">C3-69</a></p>

<p>Another employee of the Union Terminal Co., Lee E. Bowers, Jr.,
was at work in a railroad tower about 14 feet above the tracks to the
north of the railroad bridge and northwest of the corner of Elm and
Houston, approximately 50 yards from the back of the Depository.<a id="FNanchor_C3-70" href="#Footnote_C3-70" class="fnanchor">C3-70</a>
(See Commission Exhibit No. 2218, <a href="#Page_73">p. 73</a>.) From the tower he could
view people moving in the railroad yards and at the rear of the
Depository. According to Bowers, “Since approximately 10 o’clock
in the morning traffic had been cut off into the area so that anyone
moving around could actually be observed.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-71" href="#Footnote_C3-71" class="fnanchor">C3-71</a> During the 20 minutes
prior to the arrival of the motorcade, Bowers noticed three automobiles
which entered his immediate area; two left without discharging
any passengers and the third was apparently on its way out when
last observed by Bowers.<a id="FNanchor_C3-72" href="#Footnote_C3-72" class="fnanchor">C3-72</a> Bowers observed only three or four people
in the general area, as well as a few bystanders on the railroad bridge
over the Triple Underpass.<a id="FNanchor_C3-73" href="#Footnote_C3-73" class="fnanchor">C3-73</a></p>

<p>As the motorcade proceeded toward the Triple Underpass, the spectators
were clustered together along the east concrete wall of the
railroad bridge facing the oncoming procession.<a id="FNanchor_C3-74" href="#Footnote_C3-74" class="fnanchor">C3-74</a> (See Commission
Exhibit No. 2215, <a href="#Page_75">p. 75</a>.) Patrolman Foster stood immediately behind
them and could observe all of them.<a id="FNanchor_C3-75" href="#Footnote_C3-75" class="fnanchor">C3-75</a> Secret Service agents in
the lead car of the motorcade observed the bystanders and the police
officer on the bridge.<a id="FNanchor_C3-76" href="#Footnote_C3-76" class="fnanchor">C3-76</a> Special Agent Winston G. Lawson motioned
through the windshield in an unsuccessful attempt to instruct Patrolman
Foster to move the people away from their position directly over
the path of the motorcade.<a id="FNanchor_C3-77" href="#Footnote_C3-77" class="fnanchor">C3-77</a> Some distance away, on the Stemmons
Freeway overpass above Elm Street, Patrolman Murphy also had the
group on the railroad bridge within view.<a id="FNanchor_C3-78" href="#Footnote_C3-78" class="fnanchor">C3-78</a> When he heard the shots,
Foster rushed to the wall of the railroad bridge over the Triple
Underpass and looked toward the street.<a id="FNanchor_C3-79" href="#Footnote_C3-79" class="fnanchor">C3-79</a> After the third shot,
Foster ran toward the Depository and shortly thereafter informed
Inspector Herbert J. Sawyer of the Dallas Police Department that
he thought the shots came from the vicinity of Elm and Houston.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span><a id="FNanchor_C3-80" href="#Footnote_C3-80" class="fnanchor">C3-80</a></p>

Other witnesses on the railroad bridge had varying views concerning
the source and number of the shots. Austin L. Miller, employed
by the Texas-Louisiana Freight Bureau, heard three shots and thought
that they came from the area of the Presidential limousine itself.<a id="FNanchor_C3-81" href="#Footnote_C3-81" class="fnanchor">C3-81</a>
One of his coworkers, Royce G. Skelton, thought he heard four shots,
but could not tell their exact source.<a id="FNanchor_C3-82" href="#Footnote_C3-82" class="fnanchor">C3-82</a> Frank E. Reilly, an electrician
at Union Terminal, heard three shots which seemed to come from
the trees “On the north side of Elm Street at the corner up there.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-83" href="#Footnote_C3-83" class="fnanchor">C3-83</a>
According to S.M. Holland, there were four shots which sounded as
though they came from the trees on the north side of Elm Street where
he saw a puff of smoke.<a id="FNanchor_C3-84" href="#Footnote_C3-84" class="fnanchor">C3-84</a> Thomas J. Murphy, a mail foreman at
Union Terminal Co., heard two shots and said that they came from
a spot just west of the Depository.<a id="FNanchor_C3-85" href="#Footnote_C3-85" class="fnanchor">C3-85</a> In the railroad tower, Bowers
heard three shots, which sounded as though they came either from
the Depository Building or near the mouth of the Triple Underpass.
Prior to November 22, 1963, Bowers had noted the similarity of the
sounds coming from the vicinity of the Depository and those from
the Triple Underpass, which he attributed to “a reverberation which
takes place from either location.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-86" href="#Footnote_C3-86" class="fnanchor">C3-86</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the shots were fired, neither the policemen nor
the spectators on the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass saw
anything suspicious on the bridge in their vicinity. (See Commission
Exhibit No. 2214, <a href="#Page_74">p. 74</a>.) No one saw anyone with a rifle.
As he ran around through the railroad yards to the Depository,
Patrolman Foster saw no suspicious activity.<a id="FNanchor_C3-87" href="#Footnote_C3-87" class="fnanchor">C3-87</a> The same was true
of the other bystanders, many of whom made an effort after the
shooting to observe any unusual activity. Holland, for example,
immediately after the shots, ran off the overpass to see if there
was anyone behind the picket fence on the north side of Elm Street,
but he did not see anyone among the parked cars.<a id="FNanchor_C3-88" href="#Footnote_C3-88" class="fnanchor">C3-88</a> Miller did not see
anyone running across the railroad tracks or on the plaza west of the
Depository.<a id="FNanchor_C3-89" href="#Footnote_C3-89" class="fnanchor">C3-89</a> Bowers and others saw a motorcycle officer dismount
hurriedly and come running up the incline on the north side of Elm
Street.<a id="FNanchor_C3-90" href="#Footnote_C3-90" class="fnanchor">C3-90</a> The motorcycle officer, Clyde A. Haygood, saw no one
running from the railroad yards.<a id="FNanchor_C3-91" href="#Footnote_C3-91" class="fnanchor">C3-91</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr39">THE PRESIDENTIAL AUTOMOBILE</h3>

<p>After the Presidential car was returned to Washington on November
22, 1963, Secret Service agents found two bullet fragments in the
front seat. One fragment, found on the seat beside the driver, weighed
44.6 grains and consisted of the nose portion of a bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C3-92" href="#Footnote_C3-92" class="fnanchor">C3-92</a> The other
fragment, found along the right side of the front seat, weighed 21.0
grains and consisted of the base portion of a bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C3-93" href="#Footnote_C3-93" class="fnanchor">C3-93</a> During the
course of an examination on November 23, agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation found three small lead particles, weighing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
between seven-tenths and nine-tenths of a grain each, on the rug
underneath the left jump seat which had been occupied by Mrs.
Connally.<a id="FNanchor_C3-94" href="#Footnote_C3-94" class="fnanchor">C3-94</a> During this examination, the Bureau agents noted a
small residue of lead on the inside surface of the laminated windshield
and a very small pattern of cracks on the outer layer of the windshield
immediately behind the lead residue.<a id="FNanchor_C3-95" href="#Footnote_C3-95" class="fnanchor">C3-95</a> There was a minute
particle of glass missing from the outside surface, but no penetration.
The inside layer of glass was not broken.<a id="FNanchor_C3-96" href="#Footnote_C3-96" class="fnanchor">C3-96</a> The agents also observed a
dent in the strip of chrome across the top of the windshield, located
to the left of the rear view mirror support.<a id="FNanchor_C3-97" href="#Footnote_C3-97" class="fnanchor">C3-97</a></p>

<p>The lead residue on the inside of the windshield was compared
under spectrographic analysis by FBI experts with the bullet fragments
found on and alongside the front seat and with the fragments
under the left jump seat. It was also compared with bullet fragments
found at Parkland Hospital. All these bullet fragments were found
to be similar in metallic composition, but it was not possible to
determine whether two or more of the fragments came from the same
bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C3-98" href="#Footnote_C3-98" class="fnanchor">C3-98</a> It is possible for the fragments from the front seat to have
been a part of the same bullet as the three fragments found near the
left jump seat,<a id="FNanchor_C3-99" href="#Footnote_C3-99" class="fnanchor">C3-99</a> since a whole bullet of this type weighs 160-161
grains.<a id="FNanchor_C3-100" href="#Footnote_C3-100" class="fnanchor">C3-100</a> (See app. X, <a href="#Page_555">pp. 555-558</a>.)</p>

<p>The physical characteristics of the windshield after the assassination
demonstrate that the windshield was struck on the inside surface.
The windshield is composed of two layers of glass with a very thin
layer of plastic in the middle “which bonds them together in the form of
safety glass.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-101" href="#Footnote_C3-101" class="fnanchor">C3-101</a> The windshield was extracted from the automobile
and was examined during a Commission hearing.<a id="FNanchor_C3-102" href="#Footnote_C3-102" class="fnanchor">C3-102</a> (See Commission
Exhibit No. 350, <a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>.) According to Robert A. Frazier, FBI
firearms expert, the fact that cracks were present on the outer layer of
glass showed that the glass had been struck from the inside. He
testified that the windshield</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">could not have been struck on the outside surface because of
the manner in which the glass broke and further because of the
lead residue on the inside surface. The cracks appear in the
outer layer of the glass because the glass is bent outward at the
time of impact which stretches the outer layer of the glass to
the point where these small radial or wagon spoke, wagon wheel
spoke-type cracks appear on the outer surface.<a id="FNanchor_C3-103" href="#Footnote_C3-103" class="fnanchor">C3-103</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Although there is some uncertainty whether the dent in the chrome on
the windshield was present prior to the assassination,<a id="FNanchor_C3-104" href="#Footnote_C3-104" class="fnanchor">C3-104</a> Frazier
testified that the dent “had been caused by some projectile which struck
the chrome on the inside surface.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-105" href="#Footnote_C3-105" class="fnanchor">C3-105</a> If it was caused by a shot during
the assassination, Frazier stated that it would not have been caused
by a bullet traveling at full velocity, but rather by a fragment traveling
at “fairly high velocity.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-106" href="#Footnote_C3-106" class="fnanchor">C3-106</a> It could have been caused by either
fragment found in the front seat of the limousine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span><a id="FNanchor_C3-107" href="#Footnote_C3-107" class="fnanchor">C3-107</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr40">EXPERT EXAMINATION OF RIFLE, CARTRIDGE CASES, AND BULLET FRAGMENTS</h3>

<p>On the sixth floor of the Depository Building, the Dallas police
found three spent cartridges and a rifle. A nearly whole bullet was
discovered on the stretcher used to carry Governor Connally at Parkland
Hospital. As described in the preceding section, five bullet
fragments were found in the President’s limousine. The cartridge
cases, the nearly whole bullet and the bullet fragments were all subjected
to firearms identification analysis by qualified experts. It was
the unanimous opinion of the experts that the nearly whole bullet, the
two largest bullet fragments and the three cartridge cases were definitely
fired in the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository
Building to the exclusion of all other weapons.</p>

<h4 id="hdr41">Discovery of Cartridge Cases and Rifle</h4>

<p>Shortly after the assassination, police officers arrived at the Depository
Building and began a search for the assassin and evidence.<a id="FNanchor_C3-108" href="#Footnote_C3-108" class="fnanchor">C3-108</a>
Around 1 p.m. Deputy Sheriff Luke Mooney noticed a pile of cartons
in front of the window in the southeast corner of the sixth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C3-109" href="#Footnote_C3-109" class="fnanchor">C3-109</a>
(See Commission Exhibit No. 723, <a href="#Page_80">p. 80</a>.) Searching that area he
found at approximately 1:12 p.m. three empty cartridge cases on
the floor near the window.<a id="FNanchor_C3-110" href="#Footnote_C3-110" class="fnanchor">C3-110</a> When he was notified of Mooney’s
discovery, Capt. J. W. Fritz, chief of the homicide bureau of the
Dallas Police Department, issued instructions that nothing be moved or
touched until technicians from the police crime laboratory could take
photographs and check for fingerprints.<a id="FNanchor_C3-111" href="#Footnote_C3-111" class="fnanchor">C3-111</a> Mooney stood guard
to see that nothing was disturbed.<a id="FNanchor_C3-112" href="#Footnote_C3-112" class="fnanchor">C3-112</a> A few minutes later, Lt. J. C.
Day of the Dallas Police Department arrived and took photographs
of the cartridge cases before anything had been moved.<a id="FNanchor_C3-113" href="#Footnote_C3-113" class="fnanchor">C3-113</a></p>

<p>At 1:22 p.m. Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone and Deputy Constable
Seymour Weitzman found a bolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight
between two rows of boxes in the northwest corner near the staircase
on the sixth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C3-114" href="#Footnote_C3-114" class="fnanchor">C3-114</a> No one touched the weapon or otherwise disturbed
the scene until Captain Fritz and Lieutenant Day arrived and
the weapon was photographed as it lay on the floor.<a id="FNanchor_C3-115" href="#Footnote_C3-115" class="fnanchor">C3-115</a> After Lieutenant
Day determined that there were no fingerprints on the knob
of the bolt and that the wooden stock was too rough to take fingerprints,
he picked the rifle up by the stock and held it that way while
Captain Fritz opened the bolt and ejected a live round.<a id="FNanchor_C3-116" href="#Footnote_C3-116" class="fnanchor">C3-116</a> Lieutenant
Day retained possession of the weapon and took it back to the police
department for examination.<a id="FNanchor_C3-117" href="#Footnote_C3-117" class="fnanchor">C3-117</a> Neither Boone nor Weitzman handled
the rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C3-118" href="#Footnote_C3-118" class="fnanchor">C3-118</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr42">Discovery of Bullet at Parkland Hospital</h4>

<p>A nearly whole bullet was found on Governor Connally’s stretcher
at Parkland Hospital after the assassination. After his arrival at the
hospital the Governor was brought into trauma room No. 2 on a
stretcher, removed from the room on that stretcher a short time later,
and taken on an elevator to the second-floor operating room.<a id="FNanchor_C3-119" href="#Footnote_C3-119" class="fnanchor">C3-119</a> On the
second floor he was transferred from the stretcher to an operating
table which was then moved into the operating room, and a hospital
attendant wheeled the empty stretcher into an elevator.<a id="FNanchor_C3-120" href="#Footnote_C3-120" class="fnanchor">C3-120</a> Shortly
afterward, Darrell C. Tomlinson, the hospital’s senior engineer, removed
this stretcher from the elevator and placed it in the corridor
on the ground floor, alongside another stretcher wholly unconnected
with the care of Governor Connally.<a id="FNanchor_C3-121" href="#Footnote_C3-121" class="fnanchor">C3-121</a> A few minutes later, he
bumped one of the stretchers against the wall and a bullet rolled
out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span><a id="FNanchor_C3-122" href="#Footnote_C3-122" class="fnanchor">C3-122</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
Although Tomlinson was not certain whether the bullet came from
the Connally stretcher or the adjacent one, the Commission has concluded
that the bullet came from the Governor’s stretcher. That conclusion
is buttressed by evidence which eliminated President Kennedy’s
stretcher as a source of the bullet. President Kennedy remained
on the stretcher on which he was carried into the hospital
while the doctors tried to save his life.<a id="FNanchor_C3-123" href="#Footnote_C3-123" class="fnanchor">C3-123</a> He was never removed from
the stretcher from the time he was taken into the emergency room
until his body was placed in a casket in that same room.<a id="FNanchor_C3-124" href="#Footnote_C3-124" class="fnanchor">C3-124</a> After the
President’s body was removed from that stretcher, the linen was taken
off and placed in a hamper and the stretcher was pushed into trauma

nearly whole bullet was found.<a id="FNanchor_C3-125" href="#Footnote_C3-125" class="fnanchor">C3-125</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr43">Description of Rifle</h4>

<p>The bolt-action, clip-fed rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository,
described more fully in appendix X, is inscribed with various
markings, including “MADE ITALY,” “CAL. 6.5,” “1940” and the
number C2766.<a id="FNanchor_C3-126" href="#Footnote_C3-126" class="fnanchor">C3-126</a> (See Commission Exhibit Nos. 1303, 541(2) and
541(3), <a href="#Page_82">pp. 82-83</a>.) These markings have been explained as follows:
“MADE ITALY” refers to its origin; “CAL. 6.5” refers to the rifle’s
caliber; “1940” refers to the year of manufacture; and the number
C2766 is the serial number. This rifle is the only one of its type bearing
that serial number.<a id="FNanchor_C3-127" href="#Footnote_C3-127" class="fnanchor">C3-127</a> After review of standard reference works
and the markings on the rifle, it was identified by the FBI as a 6.5-millimeter
model 91/38 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C3-128" href="#Footnote_C3-128" class="fnanchor">C3-128</a> Experts from
the FBI made an independent determination of the caliber by inserting
a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter cartridge into the weapon
for fit, and by making a sulfur cast of the inside of the weapon’s
barrel and measuring the cast with a micrometer.<a id="FNanchor_C3-129" href="#Footnote_C3-129" class="fnanchor">C3-129</a> From outward
appearance, the weapon would appear to be a 7.35-millimeter rifle, but
its mechanism had been rebarreled with a 6.5-millimeter barrel.<a id="FNanchor_C3-130" href="#Footnote_C3-130" class="fnanchor">C3-130</a>
Constable Deputy Sheriff Weitzman, who only saw the rifle at a glance
and did not handle it, thought the weapon looked like a 7.65 Mauser
bolt-action rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C3-131" href="#Footnote_C3-131" class="fnanchor">C3-131</a> (See chapter V, <a href="#Page_235">p. 235</a>.)</p>

<p>The rifle is 40.2 inches long and weighs 8 pounds.<a id="FNanchor_C3-132" href="#Footnote_C3-132" class="fnanchor">C3-132</a> The minimum
length broken down is 34.8 inches, the length of the wooden stock.<a id="FNanchor_C3-133" href="#Footnote_C3-133" class="fnanchor">C3-133</a>
(See Commission Exhibit No. 1304, <a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>.) Attached to the weapon
is an inexpensive four-power telescopic sight, stamped “Optics Ordnance
Inc./Hollywood California,” and “Made in Japan.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-134" href="#Footnote_C3-134" class="fnanchor">C3-134</a> The
weapon also bears a sling consisting of two leather straps. The sling
is not a standard rifle sling but appears to be a musical instrument
strap or a sling from a carrying case or camera bag.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span><a id="FNanchor_C3-135" href="#Footnote_C3-135" class="fnanchor">C3-135</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr44">Expert Testimony</h4>

<p>Four experts in the field of firearms identification analyzed the
nearly whole bullet, the two largest fragments and the three cartridge
cases to determine whether they had been fired from the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository. Two of
these experts testified before the Commission. One was Robert A.
Frazier, a special agent of the FBI assigned to the FBI Laboratory
in Washington, D.C. Frazier has worked generally in the field of
firearms identification for 23 years, examining firearms of various
types for the purpose of identifying the caliber and other characteristics
of the weapons and making comparisons of bullets and cartridge
cases for the purpose of determining whether or not they were fired
in a particular weapon.<a id="FNanchor_C3-136" href="#Footnote_C3-136" class="fnanchor">C3-136</a> He estimated that he has made “in the
neighborhood of 50,000 to 60,000” firearms comparisons and has testified
in court on about 400 occasions.<a id="FNanchor_C3-137" href="#Footnote_C3-137" class="fnanchor">C3-137</a> The second witness who testified
on this subject was Joseph D. Nicol, superintendent of the bureau of
criminal identification and investigation for the State of Illinois.
Nicol also has had long and substantial experience since 1941 in firearms
identification, and estimated that he has made thousands of
bullet and cartridge case examinations.<a id="FNanchor_C3-138" href="#Footnote_C3-138" class="fnanchor">C3-138</a></p>

<p>In examining the bullet fragments and cartridge cases, these experts
applied the general principles accepted in the field of firearms
identification, which are discussed in more detail in appendix X at
pages <a href="#Page_547">547-553</a>. In brief, a determination that a particular bullet or
cartridge case has been fired in a particular weapon is based upon
a comparison of the bullet or case under examination with one or
more bullets or cases known to have been fired in that weapon.
When a bullet is fired in any given weapon, it is engraved with the
characteristics of the weapon. In addition to the rifling characteristics
of the barrel which are common to all weapons of a given make
and model, every weapon bears distinctive microscopic markings on
its barrel, firing pin and bolt face.<a id="FNanchor_C3-139" href="#Footnote_C3-139" class="fnanchor">C3-139</a> These markings arise initially
during manufacture, since the action of the manufacturing tools
differs microscopically from weapon to weapon and since, in addition,
the tools change microscopically while being used. As a weapon
is used further distinctive markings are introduced. Under microscopic
examination a qualified expert may be able to determine
whether the markings on a bullet known to have been fired in a
particular weapon and the markings on a suspect bullet are the same
and, therefore, whether both bullets were fired in the same weapon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
to the exclusion of all other weapons. Similarly, firearms identification
experts are able to compare the markings left upon the base of
cartridge cases and thereby determine whether both cartridges were
fired by the same weapon to the exclusion of all other weapons.
According to Frazier, such an identification “is made on the presence
of sufficient individual microscopic characteristics so that a very definite
pattern is formed and visualized on the two surfaces.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-140" href="#Footnote_C3-140" class="fnanchor">C3-140</a> Under
some circumstances, as where the bullet or cartridge case is seriously
mutilated, there are not sufficient individual characteristics to enable
the expert to make a firm identification.<a id="FNanchor_C3-141" href="#Footnote_C3-141" class="fnanchor">C3-141</a></p>

<p>After making independent examinations, both Frazier and Nicol
positively identified the nearly whole bullet from the stretcher and
the two larger bullet fragments found in the Presidential limousine
as having been fired in the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found
in the Depository to the exclusion of all other weapons.<a id="FNanchor_C3-142" href="#Footnote_C3-142" class="fnanchor">C3-142</a> Each of
the two bullet fragments had sufficient unmutilated area to provide
the basis for an identification.<a id="FNanchor_C3-143" href="#Footnote_C3-143" class="fnanchor">C3-143</a> However, it was not possible to
determine whether the two bullet fragments were from the same bullet
or from two different bullets.<a id="FNanchor_C3-144" href="#Footnote_C3-144" class="fnanchor">C3-144</a> With regard to the other bullet fragments
discovered in the limousine and in the course of treating President
Kennedy and Governor Connally, however, expert examination
could demonstrate only that the fragments were “similar in metallic
composition” to each other, to the two larger fragments and to the
nearly whole bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C3-145" href="#Footnote_C3-145" class="fnanchor">C3-145</a> After examination of the three cartridge cases
found on the sixth floor of the Depository, Frazier and Nicol concluded
that they had been fired in the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle to
the exclusion of all other weapons.<a id="FNanchor_C3-146" href="#Footnote_C3-146" class="fnanchor">C3-146</a> Two other experts from the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, who made independent examinations
of the nearly whole bullet, bullet fragments and cartridge cases,
reached the identical conclusions.<a id="FNanchor_C3-147" href="#Footnote_C3-147" class="fnanchor">C3-147</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr45">THE BULLET WOUNDS</h3>

<p>In considering the question of the source of the shots fired at President
Kennedy and Governor Connally, the Commission has also evaluated
the expert medical testimony of the doctors who observed the
wounds during the emergency treatment at Parkland Hospital and
during the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital. It paid particular
attention to any wound characteristics which would be of assistance
in identifying a wound as the entrance or exit point of a missile.
Additional information regarding the source and nature of the injuries
was obtained by expert examination of the clothes worn by the
two men, particularly those worn by President Kennedy, and from
the results of special wound ballistics tests conducted at the Commission’s
request, using the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle with ammunition
of the same type as that used and found on November 22,
1963.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<h4 id="hdr46">The President’s Head Wounds</h4>

<p>The detailed autopsy of President Kennedy performed on the night
of November 22 at the Bethesda Naval Hospital led the three examining
pathologists to conclude that the smaller hole in the rear of the
President’s skull was the point of entry and that the large opening
on the right side of his head was the wound of exit.<a id="FNanchor_C3-148" href="#Footnote_C3-148" class="fnanchor">C3-148</a> The smaller
hole on the back of the President’s head measured one-fourth of an
inch by five-eighths of an inch (6 by 15 millimeters).<a id="FNanchor_C3-149" href="#Footnote_C3-149" class="fnanchor">C3-149</a> The dimensions
of that wound were consistent with having been caused by a
6.5-millimeter bullet fired from behind and above which struck at a
tangent or an angle causing a 15-millimeter cut. The cut reflected a
larger dimension of entry than the bullet’s diameter of 6.5 millimeters,
since the missile, in effect, sliced along the skull for a fractional
distance until it entered.<a id="FNanchor_C3-150" href="#Footnote_C3-150" class="fnanchor">C3-150</a> The dimension of 6 millimeters, somewhat
smaller than the diameter of a 6.5-millimeter bullet, was caused by
the elastic recoil of the skull which shrinks the size of an opening after
a missile passes through it.<a id="FNanchor_C3-151" href="#Footnote_C3-151" class="fnanchor">C3-151</a></p>

<p>Lt. Col. Pierre A. Finck, Chief of the Wound Ballistics Pathology
Branch of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, who has had
extensive experience with bullet wounds, illustrated the characteristics
which led to his conclusions about the head wound by a chart
prepared by him. This chart, based on Colonel Finck’s studies of
more than 400 cases, depicted the effect of a perforating missile wound
on the human skull.<a id="FNanchor_C3-152" href="#Footnote_C3-152" class="fnanchor">C3-152</a> When a bullet enters the skull (cranial vault)
at one point and exits at another, it causes a beveling or cratering
effect where the diameter of the hole is smaller on the impact side than
on the exit side. Based on his observations of that beveling effect
on the President’s skull, Colonel Finck testified: “President Kennedy
was, in my opinion, shot from the rear. The bullet entered in the
back of the head and went out on the right side of his skull * * * he
was shot from above and behind.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-153" href="#Footnote_C3-153" class="fnanchor">C3-153</a></p>

<p>Comdr. James J. Humes, senior pathologist and director of
laboratories at the Bethesda Naval Hospital, who acted as chief
autopsy surgeon, concurred in Colonel Finck’s analysis. He compared
the beveling or coning effect to that caused by a BB shot
which strikes a pane of glass, causing a round or oval defect on the
side of the glass where the missile strikes and a belled-out or coned-out
surface on the opposite side of the glass.<a id="FNanchor_C3-154" href="#Footnote_C3-154" class="fnanchor">C3-154</a> Referring to the bullet
hole on the back of President Kennedy’s head, Commander Humes
testified: “The wound on the inner table, however, was larger and
had what in the field of wound ballistics is described as a shelving or
coning effect.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-155" href="#Footnote_C3-155" class="fnanchor">C3-155</a> After studying the other hole in the President’s
skull, Commander Humes stated: “* * * we concluded that the large
defect to the upper right side of the skull, in fact, would represent
a wound of exit.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-156" href="#Footnote_C3-156" class="fnanchor">C3-156</a> Those characteristics led Commander Humes
and Comdr. J. Thornton Boswell, chief of pathology at Bethesda
Naval Hospital, who assisted in the autopsy, to conclude that the bullet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
penetrated the rear of the President’s head and exited through a
large wound on the right side of his head.<a id="FNanchor_C3-157" href="#Footnote_C3-157" class="fnanchor">C3-157</a></p>

<p>Ballistics experiments (discussed more fully in app. X, <a href="#Page_585">pp. 585-586</a>)
showed that the rifle and bullets identified above were capable of
producing the President’s head wound. The Wound Ballistics Branch
of the U.S. Army laboratories at Edgewood Arsenal, Md., conducted
an extensive series of experiments to test the effect of Western Cartridge
Co. 6.5-millimeter bullets, the type found on Governor Connally’s
stretcher and in the Presidential limousine, fired from the
C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the Depository. The Edgewood
Arsenal tests were performed under the immediate supervision
of Alfred G. Olivier, a doctor who had spent 7 years in wounds ballistics
research for the U.S. Army.<a id="FNanchor_C3-158" href="#Footnote_C3-158" class="fnanchor">C3-158</a></p>

<p>One series of tests, performed on reconstructed inert human skulls,
demonstrated that the President’s head wound could have been caused
by the rifle and bullets fired by the assassin from the sixth-floor
window. The results of this series were illustrated by the findings on
one skull which was struck at a point closely approximating the
wound of entry on President Kennedy’s head. That bullet blew out
the right side of the reconstructed skull in a manner very similar to
the head wound of the President.<a id="FNanchor_C3-159" href="#Footnote_C3-159" class="fnanchor">C3-159</a> As a result of these tests, Dr.
Olivier concluded that a Western Cartridge Co. 6.5 bullet fired from
the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle at a distance of 90 yards would
make the same type of wound as that found on the President’s head.
Referring to the series of tests, Dr. Olivier testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It disclosed that the type of head wounds that the President
received could be done by this type of bullet. This surprised
me very much, because this type of stable bullet I didn’t think
would cause a massive head wound, I thought it would go
through making a small entrance and exit, but the bones of the
skull are enough to deform the end of this bullet causing it to
expend a lot of energy and blowing out the side of the
skull or blowing out fragments of the skull.<a id="FNanchor_C3-160" href="#Footnote_C3-160" class="fnanchor">C3-160</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">After examining the fragments of the bullet which struck the reconstructed
skull, Dr. Olivier stated <span class="locked">that—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">the recovered fragments were very similar to the ones recovered
on the front seat and on the floor of the car.</p>

<p>This, to me, indicates that those fragments did come from the
bullet that wounded the President in the head.<a id="FNanchor_C3-161" href="#Footnote_C3-161" class="fnanchor">C3-161</a></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="hdr47">The President’s Neck Wounds</h4>

<p>During the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital another bullet
wound was observed near the base of the back of President Kennedy’s
neck slightly to the right of his spine which provides further enlightenment
as to the source of the shots. The hole was located approximately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
5½ inches (14 centimeters) from the tip of the right shoulder
joint and approximately the same distance below the tip of the right
mastoid process, the bony point immediately behind the ear.<a id="FNanchor_C3-162" href="#Footnote_C3-162" class="fnanchor">C3-162</a> The
wound was approximately one-fourth by one-seventh of an inch (7 by
4 millimeters), had clean edges, was sharply delineated, and had
margins similar in all respects to those of the entry wound in the
skull.<a id="FNanchor_C3-163" href="#Footnote_C3-163" class="fnanchor">C3-163</a> Commanders Humes and Boswell agreed with Colonel
Finck’s testimony that this <span class="locked">hole—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * is a wound of entrance. * * * The basis for that conclusion
is that this wound was relatively small with clean edges.
It was not a jagged wound, and that is what we see in wound of
entrance at a long range.<a id="FNanchor_C3-164" href="#Footnote_C3-164" class="fnanchor">C3-164</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The autopsy examination further disclosed that, after entering the
President, the bullet passed between two large muscles, produced a
contusion on the upper part of the pleural cavity (without penetrating
that cavity), bruised the top portion of the right lung and ripped the
windpipe (trachea) in its path through the President’s neck.<a id="FNanchor_C3-165" href="#Footnote_C3-165" class="fnanchor">C3-165</a> The
examining surgeons concluded that the wounds were caused by the
bullet rather than the tracheotomy performed at Parkland Hospital.
The nature of the bruises indicated that the President’s heart and
lungs were functioning when the bruises were caused, whereas there
was very little circulation in the President’s body when incisions on
the President’s chest were made to insert tubes during the tracheotomy.<a id="FNanchor_C3-166" href="#Footnote_C3-166" class="fnanchor">C3-166</a>
No bone was struck by the bullet which passed through the
President’s body.<a id="FNanchor_C3-167" href="#Footnote_C3-167" class="fnanchor">C3-167</a> By projecting from a point of entry on the rear
of the neck and proceeding at a slight downward angle through the
bruised interior portions, the doctors concluded that the bullet exited
from the front portion of the President’s neck that had been cut away
by the tracheotomy.<a id="FNanchor_C3-168" href="#Footnote_C3-168" class="fnanchor">C3-168</a></p>

<p>Concluding that a bullet passed through the President’s neck, the
doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital rejected a theory that the bullet
lodged in the large muscles in the back of his neck and fell out through
the point of entry when external heart massage was applied at Parkland
Hospital. In the earlier stages of the autopsy, the surgeons were
unable to find a path into any large muscle in the back of the neck.
At that time they did not know that there had been a bullet hole in the
front of the President’s neck when he arrived at Parkland Hospital
because the tracheotomy incision had completely eliminated that
evidence.<a id="FNanchor_C3-169" href="#Footnote_C3-169" class="fnanchor">C3-169</a> While the autopsy was being performed, surgeons learned
that a whole bullet had been found at Parkland Hospital on a stretcher
which, at that time, was thought to be the stretcher occupied by the
President. This led to speculation that the bullet might have penetrated
a short distance into the back of the neck and then dropped out
onto the stretcher as a result of the external heart massage.<a id="FNanchor_C3-170" href="#Footnote_C3-170" class="fnanchor">C3-170</a></p>

<p>Further exploration during the autopsy disproved that theory. The
surgeons determined that the bullet had passed between two large strap
muscles and bruised them without leaving any channel, since the bullet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
merely passed between them.<a id="FNanchor_C3-171" href="#Footnote_C3-171" class="fnanchor">C3-171</a> Commander Humes, who believed
that a tracheotomy had been performed from his observations at the
autopsy, talked by telephone with Dr. Perry early on the morning of
November 23, and learned that his assumption was correct and that
Dr. Perry had used the missile wound in the neck as the point to make
the incision.<a id="FNanchor_C3-172" href="#Footnote_C3-172" class="fnanchor">C3-172</a> This confirmed the Bethesda surgeons’ conclusion
that the bullet had exited from the front part of the neck.</p>

<p>The findings of the doctors who conducted the autopsy were consistent
with the observations of the doctors who treated the President
at Parkland Hospital. Dr. Charles S. Carrico, a resident surgeon at
Parkland, noted a small wound approximately one-fourth of an inch
in diameter (5 to 8 millimeters) in the lower third of the neck below the
Adam’s apple.<a id="FNanchor_C3-173" href="#Footnote_C3-173" class="fnanchor">C3-173</a> Dr. Malcolm O. Perry, who performed the tracheotomy,
described the wound as approximately one-fifth of an inch in
diameter (5 millimeters) and exuding blood which partially hid edges
that were “neither cleancut, that is, punched out, nor were they very
ragged.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-174" href="#Footnote_C3-174" class="fnanchor">C3-174</a> Dr. Carrico testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Q. Based on your observations on the neck wound alone did you
have a sufficient basis to form an opinion as to whether it was an
entrance or an exit wound?</p>

<p>A. No, sir; we did not. Not having completely evaluated all
the wounds, traced out the course of the bullets, this wound would
have been compatible with either entrance or exit wound depending
upon the size, the velocity, the tissue structure and so forth.<a id="FNanchor_C3-175" href="#Footnote_C3-175" class="fnanchor">C3-175</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The same response was made by Dr. Perry to a similar query:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Q. Based on the appearance of the neck wound alone, could it
have been either an entrance or an exit wound?</p>

<p>A. It could have been either.<a id="FNanchor_C3-176" href="#Footnote_C3-176" class="fnanchor">C3-176</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Then each doctor was asked to take into account the other known facts,
such as the autopsy findings, the approximate distance the bullet
traveled and tested muzzle velocity of the assassination weapon. With
these additional factors, the doctors commented on the wound on the
front of the President’s neck as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. With those facts and the fact as I understand it
no other bullet was found this would be, this was, I believe, was an
exit wound.<a id="FNanchor_C3-177" href="#Footnote_C3-177" class="fnanchor">C3-177</a></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. A full jacketed bullet without deformation passing
through skin would leave a similar wound for an exit and entrance
wound and with the facts which you have made available and with
these assumptions, I believe that it was an exit wound.<a id="FNanchor_C3-178" href="#Footnote_C3-178" class="fnanchor">C3-178</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Other doctors at Parkland Hospital who observed the wound prior
to the tracheotomy agreed with the observations of Drs. Perry and
Carrico.<a id="FNanchor_C3-179" href="#Footnote_C3-179" class="fnanchor">C3-179</a> The bullet wound in the neck could be seen for only a short
time, since Dr. Perry eliminated evidence of it when he performed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
the tracheotomy. He selected that spot since it was the point where
such an operation was customarily performed, and it was one of the
safest and easiest spots from which to reach the trachea. In addition,
there was possibly an underlying wound to the muscles in the neck, the
carotid artery or the jugular vein, and Dr. Perry concluded that the
incision, therefore, had to be low in order to maintain respiration.<a id="FNanchor_C3-180" href="#Footnote_C3-180" class="fnanchor">C3-180</a></p>

<p>Considerable confusion has arisen because of comments attributed
to Dr. Perry concerning the nature of the neck wound. Immediately
after the assassination, many people reached erroneous conclusions
about the source of the shots because of Dr. Perry’s observations to
the press. On the afternoon of November 22, a press conference
was organized at Parkland Hospital by members of the White House
press staff and a hospital administrator. Newsmen with microphones
and cameras were crowded into a room to hear statements by Drs.
Perry and William Kemp Clark, chief neurosurgeon at Parkland,
who had attended to President Kennedy’s head injury. Dr. Perry
described the situation as “bedlam.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-181" href="#Footnote_C3-181" class="fnanchor">C3-181</a> The confusion was compounded
by the fact that some questions were only partially answered before
other questions were asked.<a id="FNanchor_C3-182" href="#Footnote_C3-182" class="fnanchor">C3-182</a></p>

<p>At the news conference, Dr. Perry answered a series of hypothetical
questions and stated to the press that a variety of possibilities could
account for the President’s wounds. He stated that a single bullet
could have caused the President’s wounds by entering through the
throat, striking the spine, and being deflected upward with the point
of exit being through the head.<a id="FNanchor_C3-183" href="#Footnote_C3-183" class="fnanchor">C3-183</a> This would have accounted for the
two wounds he observed, the hole in the front of the neck and the
large opening in the skull. At that time, Dr. Perry did not know
about either the wound on the back of the President’s neck or the
small bullet-hole wound in the back of the head. As described in
chapter II, the President was lying on his back during his entire
time at Parkland. The small hole in the head was also hidden from
view by the large quantity of blood which covered the President’s head.
Dr. Perry said his answers at the press conference were intended to
convey his theory about what could have happened, based on his limited
knowledge at the time, rather than his professional opinion about
what did happen.<a id="FNanchor_C3-184" href="#Footnote_C3-184" class="fnanchor">C3-184</a> Commenting on his answers at the press conference,
Dr. Perry testified before the Commission:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I expressed it [his answers] as a matter of speculation that this
was conceivable. But, again, Dr. Clark [who also answered
questions at the conference] and I emphasized that we had no way
of knowing.<a id="FNanchor_C3-185" href="#Footnote_C3-185" class="fnanchor">C3-185</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Dr. Perry’s recollection of his comments is corroborated by some of
the news stories after the press conference. The New York Herald
Tribune on November 23, 1963, reported as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Dr. Malcolm Perry, 34, attendant surgeon at Parkland Hospital
who attended the President, said he saw two wounds—one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
below the Adam’s apple, the other at the back of the head.
He said he did not know if two bullets were involved. It is
possible, he said, that the neck wound was the entrance and the
other the exit of the missile.<a id="FNanchor_C3-186" href="#Footnote_C3-186" class="fnanchor">C3-186</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">According to this report, Dr. Perry stated merely that it was “possible”
that the neck wound was a wound of entrance. This conforms with
his testimony before the Commission, where he stated that by themselves
the characteristics of the neck wound were consistent with
being either a point of entry or exit.</p>

<p><i>Wound ballistics tests.</i>—Experiments performed by the Army
Wound Ballistics experts at Edgewood Arsenal, Md. (discussed in
app. X, <a href="#Page_582">p. 582</a>) showed that under simulated conditions entry and
exit wounds are very similar in appearance. After reviewing the path
of the bullet through the President’s neck, as disclosed in the autopsy
report, the experts simulated the neck by using comparable material
with a thickness of approximately 5½ inches (13½ to 14½ centimeters),
which was the distance traversed by the bullet. Animal skin
was placed on each side, and Western Cartridge Co. 6.5 bullets were
fired from the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle from a distance of 180
feet. The animal skin on the entry side showed holes which were
regular and round. On the exit side two holes were only slightly elongated,
indicating that the bullet had become only a little unstable at
the point of exit.<a id="FNanchor_C3-187" href="#Footnote_C3-187" class="fnanchor">C3-187</a> A third exit hole was round, although not quite
as regular as the entry holes.<a id="FNanchor_C3-188" href="#Footnote_C3-188" class="fnanchor">C3-188</a> The exit holes, especially the one most
nearly round, appeared similar to the descriptions given by Drs. Perry
and Carrico of the hole in the front of the President’s neck.<a id="FNanchor_C3-189" href="#Footnote_C3-189" class="fnanchor">C3-189</a></p>

<p>The autopsy disclosed that the bullet which entered the back of
the President’s neck hit no bony structure and proceeded in a slightly
downward angle. The markings on the President’s clothing indicate
that the bullet moved in a slight right to left lateral direction as
it passed through the President’s body.<a id="FNanchor_C3-190" href="#Footnote_C3-190" class="fnanchor">C3-190</a> After the examining doctors
expressed the thought that a bullet would have lost very little
velocity in passing through the soft tissue of the neck, wound ballistics
experts conducted tests to measure the exit velocity of the bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C3-191" href="#Footnote_C3-191" class="fnanchor">C3-191</a>
The tests were the same as those used to create entry and exit holes,
supplemented by the use of break-type screens which measured the
velocity of bullets. The entrance velocity of the bullet fired from the
rifle averaged 1,904 feet per second after it traveled 180 feet. The
exit velocity averaged 1,772 to 1,798 feet per second, depending upon
the substance through which the bullet passed. A photograph of the
path of the bullet traveling through the simulated neck showed that it
proceeded in a straight line and was stable.<a id="FNanchor_C3-192" href="#Footnote_C3-192" class="fnanchor">C3-192</a></p>

<p><i>Examination of clothing.</i>—The clothing worn by President Kennedy
on November 22 had holes and tears which showed that a missile
entered the back of his clothing in the vicinity of his lower neck
and exited through the front of his shirt immediately behind his tie,
nicking the knot of his tie in its forward flight.<a id="FNanchor_C3-193" href="#Footnote_C3-193" class="fnanchor">C3-193</a> Although the caliber
of the bullet could not be determined and some of the clothing items<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
precluded a positive determination that some tears were made by
a bullet, all the defects could have been caused by a 6.5-millimeter
bullet entering the back of the President’s lower neck and exiting in
the area of the knot of his tie.<a id="FNanchor_C3-194" href="#Footnote_C3-194" class="fnanchor">C3-194</a></p>

<p>An examination of the suit jacket worn by the President by FBI
Agent Frazier revealed a roughly circular hole approximately one-fourth
of an inch in diameter on the rear of the coat, 5⅜ inches below
the top of the collar and 1¾ inches to the right of the center back seam
of the coat.<a id="FNanchor_C3-195" href="#Footnote_C3-195" class="fnanchor">C3-195</a> The hole was visible on the upper rear of the coat slightly
to the right of center. Traces of copper were found in the margins
of the hole and the cloth fibers around the margins were pushed inward.<a id="FNanchor_C3-196" href="#Footnote_C3-196" class="fnanchor">C3-196</a>
Those characteristics established that the hole was caused
by an entering bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C3-197" href="#Footnote_C3-197" class="fnanchor">C3-197</a> Although the precise size of the bullet could
not be determined from the hole, it was consistent with having been
made by a 6.5-millimeter bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C3-198" href="#Footnote_C3-198" class="fnanchor">C3-198</a></p>

<p>The shirt worn by the President contained a hole on the back side
5¾ inches below the top of the collar and 1⅛ inches to the right of
the middle of the back of the shirt.<a id="FNanchor_C3-199" href="#Footnote_C3-199" class="fnanchor">C3-199</a> The hole on the rear of the
shirt was approximately circular in shape and about one-fourth of an
inch in diameter, with the fibers pressed inward.<a id="FNanchor_C3-200" href="#Footnote_C3-200" class="fnanchor">C3-200</a> These factors
established it as a bullet entrance hole.<a id="FNanchor_C3-201" href="#Footnote_C3-201" class="fnanchor">C3-201</a> The relative position of the
hole in the back of the suit jacket to the hole in the back of the shirt
indicated that both were caused by the same penetrating missile.<a id="FNanchor_C3-202" href="#Footnote_C3-202" class="fnanchor">C3-202</a></p>

<p>On the front of the shirt, examination revealed a hole seven-eighths
of an inch below the collar button and a similar opening seven-eighths
of an inch below the buttonhole. These two holes fell into alinement
on overlapping positions when the shirt was buttoned.<a id="FNanchor_C3-203" href="#Footnote_C3-203" class="fnanchor">C3-203</a> Each hole
was a vertical, ragged slit approximately one-half of an inch in height,
with the cloth fibers protruding outward. Although the characteristics
of the slit established that the missile had exited to the front, the
irregular nature of the slit precluded a positive determination that it
was a bullet hole.<a id="FNanchor_C3-204" href="#Footnote_C3-204" class="fnanchor">C3-204</a> However, the hole could have been caused by a
round bullet although the characteristics were not sufficiently clear to
enable the examining expert to render a conclusive opinion.<a id="FNanchor_C3-205" href="#Footnote_C3-205" class="fnanchor">C3-205</a></p>

<p>When the President’s clothing was removed at Parkland Hospital,
his tie was cut off by severing the loop immediately to the wearer’s
left of the knot, leaving the knot in its original condition.<a id="FNanchor_C3-206" href="#Footnote_C3-206" class="fnanchor">C3-206</a> The tie
had a nick on the left side of the knot.<a id="FNanchor_C3-207" href="#Footnote_C3-207" class="fnanchor">C3-207</a> The nick was elongated
horizontally, indicating that the tear was made by some object moving
horizontally, but the fibers were not affected in a manner which
would shed light on the direction or the nature of the missile.<a id="FNanchor_C3-208" href="#Footnote_C3-208" class="fnanchor">C3-208</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr48">The Governor’s Wounds</h4>

<p>While riding in the right jump seat of the Presidential limousine
on November 22, Governor Connally sustained wounds of the back,
chest, right wrist and left thigh. Because of the small size and clean-cut
edges of the wound on the Governor’s back, Dr. Robert Shaw concluded
that it was an entry wound.<a id="FNanchor_C3-209" href="#Footnote_C3-209" class="fnanchor">C3-209</a> The bullet traversed the Governor’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
chest in a downward angle, shattering his fifth rib, and exited
below the right nipple.<a id="FNanchor_C3-210" href="#Footnote_C3-210" class="fnanchor">C3-210</a> The ragged edges of the 2-inch (5 centimeters)
opening on the front of the chest led Dr. Shaw to conclude
that it was the exit point of the bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C3-211" href="#Footnote_C3-211" class="fnanchor">C3-211</a> When Governor Connally
testified before the Commission 5 months after the assassination, on
April 21, 1964, the Commission observed the Governor’s chest wounds,
as well as the injuries to his wrist and thigh and watched Dr. Shaw
measure with a caliper an angle of declination of 25° from the
point of entry on the back to the point of exit on the front of the
Governor’s chest.<a id="FNanchor_C3-212" href="#Footnote_C3-212" class="fnanchor">C3-212</a></p>

<p>At the time of the shooting, Governor Connally was unaware
that he had sustained any injuries other than his chest wounds.<a id="FNanchor_C3-213" href="#Footnote_C3-213" class="fnanchor">C3-213</a> On
the back of his arm, about 2 inches (5 centimeters) above the wrist
joint on the thumb side, Dr. Charles F. Gregory observed a linear
perforating wound approximately one-fifth of an inch (one-half
centimeter) wide and 1 inch (2½ centimeters) long.<a id="FNanchor_C3-214" href="#Footnote_C3-214" class="fnanchor">C3-214</a> During his
operation on this injury, the doctor concluded that this ragged wound
was the point of entry because thread and cloth had been carried into
the wound to the region of the bone.<a id="FNanchor_C3-215" href="#Footnote_C3-215" class="fnanchor">C3-215</a> Dr. Gregory’s conclusions were
also based upon the location in the Governor’s wrist, as revealed by
X-ray, of small fragments of metal shed by the missile upon striking
the firm surface of the bone.<a id="FNanchor_C3-216" href="#Footnote_C3-216" class="fnanchor">C3-216</a> Evidence of different amounts of air
in the tissues of the wrist gave further indication that the bullet passed
from the back to the front of the wrist.<a id="FNanchor_C3-217" href="#Footnote_C3-217" class="fnanchor">C3-217</a> An examination of the
palm surface of the wrist showed a wound approximately one-fifth
of an inch (one-half centimeter) long and approximately three-fourths
of an inch (2 centimeters) above the crease of the right wrist.<a id="FNanchor_C3-218" href="#Footnote_C3-218" class="fnanchor">C3-218</a> Dr.
Shaw had initially believed that the missile entered on the palm side of
the Governor’s wrist and exited on the back side.<a id="FNanchor_C3-219" href="#Footnote_C3-219" class="fnanchor">C3-219</a> After reviewing
the factors considered by Dr. Gregory, however, Dr. Shaw withdrew
his earlier opinion. He deferred to the judgment of Dr. Gregory, who
had more closely examined that wound during the wrist operation.<a id="FNanchor_C3-220" href="#Footnote_C3-220" class="fnanchor">C3-220</a></p>

<p>In addition, Governor Connally suffered a puncture wound in the
left thigh that was approximately two-fifths of an inch (1 centimeter)
in diameter and located approximately 5 or 6 inches above the Governor’s
left knee.<a id="FNanchor_C3-221" href="#Footnote_C3-221" class="fnanchor">C3-221</a> On the Governor’s leg, very little soft-tissue
damage was noted, which indicated a tangential wound or the penetration
of a larger missile entering at low velocity and stopping after
entering the skin.<a id="FNanchor_C3-222" href="#Footnote_C3-222" class="fnanchor">C3-222</a> X-ray examination disclosed a tiny metallic
fragment embedded in the Governor’s leg.<a id="FNanchor_C3-223" href="#Footnote_C3-223" class="fnanchor">C3-223</a> The surgeons who
attended the Governor concluded that the thigh wound was not caused
by the small fragment in the thigh but resulted from the impact of a
larger missile.<a id="FNanchor_C3-224" href="#Footnote_C3-224" class="fnanchor">C3-224</a></p>

<p><i>Examination of clothing.</i>—The clothing worn by Governor Connally
on November 22, 1963, contained holes which matched his wounds.
On the back of the Governor’s coat, a hole was found 1⅛ inches
from the seam where the right sleeve attached to the coat and 7¼
inches to the right of the midline.<a id="FNanchor_C3-225" href="#Footnote_C3-225" class="fnanchor">C3-225</a> This hole was elongated in a
horizontal direction approximately five-eighths of an inch in length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
and one-fourth of an inch in height.<a id="FNanchor_C3-226" href="#Footnote_C3-226" class="fnanchor">C3-226</a> The front side of the Governor’s
coat contained a circular hole three-eighths of an inch in diameter,
located 5 inches to the right of the front right edge of the coat slightly
above the top button.<a id="FNanchor_C3-227" href="#Footnote_C3-227" class="fnanchor">C3-227</a> A rough hole approximately five-eighths of an
inch in length and three-eighths of an inch in width was found near the
end of the right sleeve.<a id="FNanchor_C3-228" href="#Footnote_C3-228" class="fnanchor">C3-228</a> Each of these holes could have been caused
by a bullet, but a positive determination of this fact or the direction
of the missile was not possible because the garment had been cleaned
and pressed prior to any opportunity for a scientific examination.<a id="FNanchor_C3-229" href="#Footnote_C3-229" class="fnanchor">C3-229</a></p>

<p>An examination of the Governor’s shirt disclosed a very ragged
tear five-eighths of an inch long horizontally and one-half of an inch
vertically on the back of the shirt near the right sleeve 2 inches from
the line where the sleeve attaches.<a id="FNanchor_C3-230" href="#Footnote_C3-230" class="fnanchor">C3-230</a> Immediately to the right was
another small tear, approximately three-sixteenths of an inch long.<a id="FNanchor_C3-231" href="#Footnote_C3-231" class="fnanchor">C3-231</a>
The two holes corresponded in position to the hole in the back of the
Governor’s coat.<a id="FNanchor_C3-232" href="#Footnote_C3-232" class="fnanchor">C3-232</a> A very irregular tear in the form of an “H” was
observed on the front side of the Governor’s shirt, approximately 1½
inches high, with a crossbar tear approximately 1 inch wide, located 5
inches from the right side seam and 9 inches from the top of the right
sleeve.<a id="FNanchor_C3-233" href="#Footnote_C3-233" class="fnanchor">C3-233</a> Because the shirt had been laundered, there were insufficient
characteristics for the expert examiner to form a conclusive opinion
on the direction or nature of the object causing the holes.<a id="FNanchor_C3-234" href="#Footnote_C3-234" class="fnanchor">C3-234</a> The rear
hole could have been caused by the entrance of a 6.5-millimeter bullet
and the front hole by the exit of such a bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C3-235" href="#Footnote_C3-235" class="fnanchor">C3-235</a></p>

<p>On the French cuff of the right sleeve of the Governor’s shirt was
a ragged, irregularly shaped hole located 1½ inches from the end of
the sleeve and 5½ inches from the outside cuff-link hole.<a id="FNanchor_C3-236" href="#Footnote_C3-236" class="fnanchor">C3-236</a> The characteristics
after laundering did not permit positive conclusions but
these holes could have been caused by a bullet passing through the
Governor’s right wrist from the back to the front sides.<a id="FNanchor_C3-237" href="#Footnote_C3-237" class="fnanchor">C3-237</a> The Governor’s
trousers contained a hole approximately one-fourth of an inch
in diameter in the region of the left knee.<a id="FNanchor_C3-238" href="#Footnote_C3-238" class="fnanchor">C3-238</a> The roughly circular
shape of the hole and the slight tearing away from the edges gave the
hole the general appearance of a bullet hole but it was not possible to
determine the direction of the missile which caused the hole.<a id="FNanchor_C3-239" href="#Footnote_C3-239" class="fnanchor">C3-239</a></p>

<p><i>Course of bullet.</i>—Ballistics experiments and medical findings established
that the missile which passed through the Governor’s wrist
and penetrated his thigh had first traversed his chest. The Army
Wound Ballistics experts conducted tests which proved that the Governor’s
wrist wound was not caused by a pristine bullet. (See app.
X, <a href="#Page_582">pp. 582-585</a>.) A bullet is pristine immediately on exiting from a
rifle muzzle when it moves in a straight line with a spinning motion and
maintains its uniform trajectory with but a minimum of nose surface
striking the air through which it passes.<a id="FNanchor_C3-240" href="#Footnote_C3-240" class="fnanchor">C3-240</a> When the straight line of
flight of a bullet is deflected by striking some object, it starts to wobble
or become irregular in flight, a condition called yaw.<a id="FNanchor_C3-241" href="#Footnote_C3-241" class="fnanchor">C3-241</a> A bullet with
yaw has a greater surface exposed to the striking material or air,
since the target or air is struck not only by the nose of the bullet, its
smallest striking surface, but also by the bullet’s sides.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span><a id="FNanchor_C3-242" href="#Footnote_C3-242" class="fnanchor">C3-242</a></p>

<p>The ballistics experts learned the exact nature of the Governor’s
wrist wound by examining Parkland Hospital records and X-rays and
conferring with Dr. Gregory. The C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle
found in the Depository was fired with bullets of the same type as
the bullet found on the Governor’s stretcher and the fragments found
in the Presidential limousine. Shots were fired from a distance of
70 yards at comparable flesh and bone protected by material similar
to the clothing worn by the Governor.<a id="FNanchor_C3-243" href="#Footnote_C3-243" class="fnanchor">C3-243</a> One of the test shots
wounded the comparable flesh and bone structure in virtually the same
place and from the same angle as the wound inflicted on Governor
Connally’s wrist. An X-ray and photograph of the simulated wrist
confirmed the similarity.<a id="FNanchor_C3-244" href="#Footnote_C3-244" class="fnanchor">C3-244</a> The bullet which inflicted that injury
during the tests had a nose which was substantially flattened from
striking the material.<a id="FNanchor_C3-245" href="#Footnote_C3-245" class="fnanchor">C3-245</a> The striking velocity at 70 yards of seven
shots fired during the tests averaged 1,858 feet per second; the average
exit velocity of five shots was 1,776 feet per second.<a id="FNanchor_C3-246" href="#Footnote_C3-246" class="fnanchor">C3-246</a></p>

<p>The conclusion that the Governor’s wrist was not struck by a pristine
bullet was based upon the following: (1) greater damage was inflicted
on the test material than on the Governor’s wrist;<a id="FNanchor_C3-247" href="#Footnote_C3-247" class="fnanchor">C3-247</a> (2) the test material
had a smaller entry wound and a larger exit wound, characteristic
of a pristine bullet, while the Governor’s wrist had a larger entry
wound as compared with its exit wound, indicating a bullet which
was tumbling;<a id="FNanchor_C3-248" href="#Footnote_C3-248" class="fnanchor">C3-248</a> (3) cloth was carried into the wrist wound, which
is characteristic of an irregular missile;<a id="FNanchor_C3-249" href="#Footnote_C3-249" class="fnanchor">C3-249</a> (4) the partial cutting of
a radial nerve and tendon leading to the Governor’s thumb further
suggested that the bullet which struck him was not pristine, since
such a bullet would merely push aside a tendon and nerve rather than
catch and tear them;<a id="FNanchor_C3-250" href="#Footnote_C3-250" class="fnanchor">C3-250</a> (5) the bullet found on the Governor’s
stretcher probably did not pass through the wrist as a pristine bullet
because its nose was not considerably flattened, as was the case with
the pristine bullet which struck the simulated wrist;<a id="FNanchor_C3-251" href="#Footnote_C3-251" class="fnanchor">C3-251</a> and (6) the
bullet which caused the Governor’s thigh injury and then fell out of
the wound had a “very low velocity,” whereas the pristine bullets
fired during the tests possessed a very high exit velocity.<a id="FNanchor_C3-252" href="#Footnote_C3-252" class="fnanchor">C3-252</a></p>

<p>All the evidence indicated that the bullet found on the Governor’s
stretcher could have caused all his wounds. The weight of the whole
bullet prior to firing was approximately 160-161 grains and that of
the recovered bullet was 158.6 grains.<a id="FNanchor_C3-253" href="#Footnote_C3-253" class="fnanchor">C3-253</a> An X-ray of the Governor’s
wrist showed very minute metallic fragments, and two or three of
these fragments were removed from his wrist.<a id="FNanchor_C3-254" href="#Footnote_C3-254" class="fnanchor">C3-254</a> All these fragments
were sufficiently small and light so that the nearly whole bullet found
on the stretcher could have deposited those pieces of metal as it tumbled
through his wrist.<a id="FNanchor_C3-255" href="#Footnote_C3-255" class="fnanchor">C3-255</a> In their testimony, the three doctors who
attended Governor Connally at Parkland Hospital expressed independently
their opinion that a single bullet had passed through his
chest; tumbled through his wrist with very little exit velocity, leaving
small metallic fragments from the rear portion of the bullet; punctured
his left thigh after the bullet had lost virtually all of its velocity; and
had fallen out of the thigh wound.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span><a id="FNanchor_C3-256" href="#Footnote_C3-256" class="fnanchor">C3-256</a></p>

<p>Governor Connally himself thought it likely that all his wounds
were caused by a single bullet. In his testimony before the Commission,
he repositioned himself as he recalled his position on the jump
seat, with his right palm on his left thigh, and said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I * * * wound up the next day realizing I was hit in three
places, and I was not conscious of having been hit but by one
bullet, so I tried to reconstruct how I could have been hit in three
places by the same bullet, and I merely, I know it penetrated from
the back through the chest first.</p>

<p>I assumed that I had turned as I described a moment ago,
placing my right hand on my left leg, that it hit my wrist, went
out the center of the wrist, the underside, and then into my leg,
but it might not have happened that way at all.<a id="FNanchor_C3-257" href="#Footnote_C3-257" class="fnanchor">C3-257</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The Governor’s posture explained how a single missile through his
body would cause all his wounds. His doctors at Parkland Hospital
had recreated his position, also, but they placed his right arm somewhat
higher than his left thigh although in the same alinement.<a id="FNanchor_C3-258" href="#Footnote_C3-258" class="fnanchor">C3-258</a>
The wound ballistics experts concurred in the opinion that a single
bullet caused all the Governor’s wounds.<a id="FNanchor_C3-259" href="#Footnote_C3-259" class="fnanchor">C3-259</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr49">THE TRAJECTORY</h3>

<p>The cumulative evidence of eyewitnesses, firearms and ballistic experts
and medical authorities demonstrated that the shots were fired
from above and behind President Kennedy and Governor Connally,
more particularly, from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository
Building. In order to determine the facts with as much
precision as possible and to insure that all data were consistent with
the shots having been fired from the sixth floor window, the Commission
requested additional investigation, including the analysis of motion
picture films of the assassination and onsite tests. The facts
developed through this investigation by the FBI and Secret Service
confirmed the conclusions reached by the Commission regarding the
source and trajectory of the shots which hit the President and the
Governor. Moreover, these facts enabled the Commission to make
certain approximations regarding the locations of the Presidential
limousine at the time of the shots and the relevant time intervals.</p>

<h4 id="hdr50">Films and Tests</h4>

<p>When the shots rang out the Presidential limousine was moving
beyond the Texas School Book Depository Building in a southwesterly
direction on Elm Street between Houston Street and the Triple Underpass.<a id="FNanchor_C3-260" href="#Footnote_C3-260" class="fnanchor">C3-260</a>
The general location of the car was described and marked
on maps by eyewitnesses as precisely as their observations and recollections
permitted.<a id="FNanchor_C3-261" href="#Footnote_C3-261" class="fnanchor">C3-261</a> More exact information was provided by motion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
pictures taken by Abraham Zapruder, Orville O. Nix and Mary
Muchmore, who were spectators at the scene.<a id="FNanchor_C3-262" href="#Footnote_C3-262" class="fnanchor">C3-262</a> Substantial light has
been shed on the assassination sequence by viewing these motion
pictures, particularly the Zapruder film, which was the most complete
and from which individual 35-millimeter slides were made of each
motion picture frame.<a id="FNanchor_C3-263" href="#Footnote_C3-263" class="fnanchor">C3-263</a></p>

<p>Examination of the Zapruder motion picture camera by the FBI
established that 18.3 pictures or frames were taken each second, and
therefore, the timing of certain events could be calculated by allowing
1/18.3 seconds for the action depicted from one frame to the next.<a id="FNanchor_C3-264" href="#Footnote_C3-264" class="fnanchor">C3-264</a>
The films and slides made from individual frames were viewed by Governor
and Mrs. Connally, the Governor’s doctors, the autopsy surgeons,
and the Army wound ballistics scientists in order to apply the knowledge
of each to determine the precise course of events.<a id="FNanchor_C3-265" href="#Footnote_C3-265" class="fnanchor">C3-265</a> Tests of the
assassin’s rifle disclosed that at least 2.3 seconds were required between
shots.<a id="FNanchor_C3-266" href="#Footnote_C3-266" class="fnanchor">C3-266</a> In evaluating the films in the light of these timing guides,
it was kept in mind that a victim of a bullet wound may not react
immediately and, in some situations, according to experts, the victim may
not even know where he has been hit, or when.<a id="FNanchor_C3-267" href="#Footnote_C3-267" class="fnanchor">C3-267</a></p>

<p>On May 24, 1964, agents of the FBI and Secret Service conducted
a series of tests to determine as precisely as possible what happened
on November 22, 1963. Since the Presidential limousine was being
remodeled and was therefore unavailable, it was simulated by using
the Secret Service followup car, which is similar in design.<a id="FNanchor_C3-268" href="#Footnote_C3-268" class="fnanchor">C3-268</a> Any
differences were taken into account. Two Bureau agents with approximately
the same physical characteristics sat in the car in the same
relative positions as President Kennedy and Governor Connally had
occupied. The back of the stand-in for the President was marked with
chalk at the point where the bullet entered. The Governor’s model
had on the same coat worn by Governor Connally when he was shot,
with the hole in the back circled in chalk.<a id="FNanchor_C3-269" href="#Footnote_C3-269" class="fnanchor">C3-269</a></p>

<p>To simulate the conditions which existed at the assassination scene
on November 22, the lower part of the sixth-floor window at the southeast
corner of the Depository Building was raised halfway, the cardboard
boxes were repositioned, the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle
found on the sixth floor of the Depository was used, and mounted on
that rifle was a camera which recorded the view as was seen by the
assassin.<a id="FNanchor_C3-270" href="#Footnote_C3-270" class="fnanchor">C3-270</a> In addition, the Zapruder, Nix, and Muchmore cameras
were on hand so that photographs taken by these cameras from the
same locations where they were used on November 22, 1963, could be
compared with the films of that date.<a id="FNanchor_C3-271" href="#Footnote_C3-271" class="fnanchor">C3-271</a> The agents ascertained that
the foliage of an oak tree that came between the gunman and his
target along the motorcade route on Elm Street was approximately
the same as on the day of the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C3-272" href="#Footnote_C3-272" class="fnanchor">C3-272</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr51">The First Bullet That Hit</h4>

<p>The position of President Kennedy’s car when he was struck in the
neck was determined with substantial precision from the films and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
onsite tests. The pictures or frames in the Zapruder film were marked
by the agents, with the number “1” given to the first frame where the
motorcycles leading the motorcade came into view on Houston Street.<a id="FNanchor_C3-273" href="#Footnote_C3-273" class="fnanchor">C3-273</a>
The numbers continue in sequence as Zapruder filmed the Presidential
limousine as it came around the corner and proceeded down Elm.
The President was in clear view of the assassin as he rode up Houston
Street and for 100 feet as he proceeded down Elm Street, until he
came to a point denoted as frame 166 on the Zapruder film.<a id="FNanchor_C3-274" href="#Footnote_C3-274" class="fnanchor">C3-274</a> These
facts were determined in the test by placing the car and men on Elm
Street in the exact spot where they were when each frame of the
Zapruder film was photographed. To pinpoint their locations, a man
stood at Zapruder’s position and directed the automobile and both
models to the positions shown on each frame, after which a Bureau photographer
crouched at the sixth-floor window and looked through a
camera whose lens recorded the view through the telescopic sight of
the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C3-275" href="#Footnote_C3-275" class="fnanchor">C3-275</a> (See Commission Exhibit No.
887, <a href="#Page_99">p. 99</a>.) Each position was measured to determine how far President
Kennedy had gone down Elm from a point, which was designated
as station C, on a line drawn along the west curbline of Houston
Street.<a id="FNanchor_C3-276" href="#Footnote_C3-276" class="fnanchor">C3-276</a></p>

<p>Based on these calculations, the agents concluded that at frame 166
of the Zapruder film the President passed beneath the foliage of the
large oak tree and the point of impact on the President’s back disappeared
from the gunman’s view as seen through the telescopic lens.<a id="FNanchor_C3-277" href="#Footnote_C3-277" class="fnanchor">C3-277</a>
(See Commission Exhibit No. 889, <a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>.) For a fleeting instant,
the President came back into view in the telescopic lens at frame 186
as he appeared in an opening among the leaves.<a id="FNanchor_C3-278" href="#Footnote_C3-278" class="fnanchor">C3-278</a> (See Commission
Exhibit No. 891, <a href="#Page_101">p. 101</a>.) The test revealed that the next point at
which the rifleman had a clear view through the telescopic sight of
the point where the bullet entered the President’s back was when
the car emerged from behind the tree at frame 210.<a id="FNanchor_C3-279" href="#Footnote_C3-279" class="fnanchor">C3-279</a> (See Commission
Exhibit No. 893, <a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>.) According to FBI Agent Lyndal L.
Shaneyfelt, “There is no obstruction from the sixth floor window
from the time they leave the tree until they disappear down toward
the triple overpass.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-280" href="#Footnote_C3-280" class="fnanchor">C3-280</a></p>

<p>As the President rode along Elm Street for a distance of about 140
feet, he was waving to the crowd.<a id="FNanchor_C3-281" href="#Footnote_C3-281" class="fnanchor">C3-281</a> Shaneyfelt testified that the
waving is seen on the Zapruder movie until around frame 205, when a
road sign blocked out most of the President’s body from Zapruder’s
view through the lens of his camera. However, the assassin continued
to have a clear view of the President as he proceeded down Elm.<a id="FNanchor_C3-282" href="#Footnote_C3-282" class="fnanchor">C3-282</a>
When President Kennedy again came fully into view in the Zapruder
film at frame 225, he seemed to be reacting to his neck wound by
raising his hands to his throat.<a id="FNanchor_C3-283" href="#Footnote_C3-283" class="fnanchor">C3-283</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 895,
<a href="#Page_103">p. 103</a>.) According to Shaneyfelt the reaction was “clearly apparent
in 226 and barely apparent in 225.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-284" href="#Footnote_C3-284" class="fnanchor">C3-284</a> It is probable that the
President was not shot before frame 210, since it is unlikely that the
assassin would deliberately have shot at him with a view obstructed
by the oak tree when he was about to have a clear opportunity. It is
also doubtful that even the most proficient marksman would have hit
him through the oak tree. In addition, the President’s reaction is
“barely apparent” in frame 225, which is 15 frames or approximately
eight-tenths second after frame 210, and a shot much before 210 would
assume a longer reaction time than was recalled by eyewitnesses at
the scene. Thus, the evidence indicated that the President was not
hit until at least frame 210 and that he was probably hit by frame 225.
The possibility of variations in reaction time in addition to the obstruction
of Zapruder’s view by the sign precluded a more specific determination
than that the President was probably shot through the neck
between frames 210 and 225, which marked his position between 138.9
and 153.8 feet west of station C.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span><a id="FNanchor_C3-285" href="#Footnote_C3-285" class="fnanchor">C3-285</a></p>

<p>Photograph of Presidential limousine taken during motorcade.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
According to Special Agent Robert A. Frazier, who occupied the
position of the assassin in the sixth-floor window during the reenactment,
it is likely that the bullet which passed through the President’s
neck, as described previously, then struck the automobile or someone
else in the automobile.<a id="FNanchor_C3-286" href="#Footnote_C3-286" class="fnanchor">C3-286</a> The minute examination by the FBI
inspection team, conducted in Washington between 14 and 16 hours
after the assassination, revealed no damage indicating that a bullet
struck any part of the interior of the Presidential limousine, with the
exception of the cracking of the windshield and the dent on the windshield
chrome.<a id="FNanchor_C3-287" href="#Footnote_C3-287" class="fnanchor">C3-287</a> Neither of these points of damage to the car could
have been caused by the bullet which exited from the President’s neck
at a velocity of 1,772 to 1,779 feet per second.<a id="FNanchor_C3-288" href="#Footnote_C3-288" class="fnanchor">C3-288</a> If the trajectory had
permitted the bullet to strike the windshield, the bullet would have
penetrated it and traveled a substantial distance down the road unless
it struck some other object en route.<a id="FNanchor_C3-289" href="#Footnote_C3-289" class="fnanchor">C3-289</a> Had that bullet struck the
metal framing, which was dented, it would have torn a hole in the
chrome and penetrated the framing, both inside and outside the car.<a id="FNanchor_C3-290" href="#Footnote_C3-290" class="fnanchor">C3-290</a>
At that exit velocity, the bullet would have penetrated any other metal
or upholstery surface of the interior of the automobile.<a id="FNanchor_C3-291" href="#Footnote_C3-291" class="fnanchor">C3-291</a></p>

<p>The bullet that hit President Kennedy in the back and exited through
his throat most likely could not have missed both the automobile and
its occupants. Since it did not hit the automobile, Frazier testified
that it probably struck Governor Connally.<a id="FNanchor_C3-292" href="#Footnote_C3-292" class="fnanchor">C3-292</a> The relative positions
of President Kennedy and Governor Connally at the time when the
President was struck in the neck confirm that the same bullet probably
passed through both men. Pictures taken of the President’s limousine
on November 22, 1963, showed that the Governor sat immediately in
front of the President.<a id="FNanchor_C3-293" href="#Footnote_C3-293" class="fnanchor">C3-293</a> Even though the precise distance cannot be
ascertained, it is apparent that President Kennedy was somewhat to the
Governor’s right. The President sat on the extreme right, as noted in
the films and by eyewitnesses, while the right edge of the jump seat in
which the Governor sat is 6 inches from the right door.<a id="FNanchor_C3-294" href="#Footnote_C3-294" class="fnanchor">C3-294</a> (See
Commission Exhibit No. 697, <a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a>.) The President wore a back brace
which tended to make him sit up straight, and the Governor also sat
erect since the jump seat gave him little leg room.<a id="FNanchor_C3-295" href="#Footnote_C3-295" class="fnanchor">C3-295</a></p>

<p>Based on his observations during the reenactment and the position
of Governor Connally shown in the Zapruder film after the car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
emerged from behind the sign, Frazier testified that Governor Connally
was in a position during the span from frame 207 to frame 225
to receive a bullet which would have caused the wounds he actually
suffered.<a id="FNanchor_C3-296" href="#Footnote_C3-296" class="fnanchor">C3-296</a> Governor Connally viewed the film and testified that he
was hit between frames 231 and 234.<a id="FNanchor_C3-297" href="#Footnote_C3-297" class="fnanchor">C3-297</a> According to Frazier, between
frames 235 and 240 the Governor turned sharply to his right, so that
by frame 240 he was too far to the right to have received his injuries
at that time.<a id="FNanchor_C3-298" href="#Footnote_C3-298" class="fnanchor">C3-298</a> At some point between frames 235 and 240, therefore,
is the last occasion when Governor Connally could have received his
injuries, since in the frames following 240 he remained turned too far
to his right.<a id="FNanchor_C3-299" href="#Footnote_C3-299" class="fnanchor">C3-299</a> If Governor Connally was hit by a separate shot between
frames 235 and 240 which followed the shot which hit the President’s
neck, it would follow that: (1) the assassin’s first shot, assuming
a minimum firing time of 2.3 seconds (or 42 frames), was fired between
frames 193 and 198 when his view was obscured by the oak tree; (2)
President Kennedy continued waving to the crowd after he was hit
and did not begin to react for about 1½ seconds; and (3) the first shot,
although hitting no bones in the President’s body, was deflected after
its exit from the President’s neck in such a way that it failed to hit
either the automobile or any of the other occupants.</p>

<p>Viewed through the telescopic sight of the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle from the sixth-floor window during the test, the marks
that simulated the entry wounds on the stand-ins for the President and
the Governor were generally in a straight line. That alinement became
obvious to the viewer through the scope as the Governor’s model
turned slightly to his right and assumed the position which Governor
Connally had described as his position when he was struck. Viewing
the stand-ins for the President and the Governor in the sight of the
C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle at the location depicted in frames 207
and 210, Frazier testified: “They both are in direct alinement with the
telescopic sight at the window. The Governor is immediately behind
the President in the field of view.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-300" href="#Footnote_C3-300" class="fnanchor">C3-300</a> (See Commission Exhibit No.
893, <a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>.) A surveyor then placed his sighting equipment at the
precise point of entry on the back of the President’s neck, assuming
that the President was struck at frame 210, and measured the angle to
the end of the muzzle of the rifle positioned where it was believed to
have been held by the assassin.<a id="FNanchor_C3-301" href="#Footnote_C3-301" class="fnanchor">C3-301</a> That angle measured 21°34’.<a id="FNanchor_C3-302" href="#Footnote_C3-302" class="fnanchor">C3-302</a>
From the same points of reference, the angle at frame 225 was measured
at 20°11’, giving an average angle of 20°52’30” from frame 210
to frame 225.<a id="FNanchor_C3-303" href="#Footnote_C3-303" class="fnanchor">C3-303</a> Allowing for a downward street grade of 3°9’, the
probable angle through the President’s body was calculated at
17°43’30”, assuming that he was sitting in a vertical position.<a id="FNanchor_C3-304" href="#Footnote_C3-304" class="fnanchor">C3-304</a></p>

<p>That angle was consistent with the trajectory of a bullet passing
through the President’s neck and then striking Governor Connally’s
back, causing the wounds which were discussed above. Shortly after
that angle was ascertained, the open car and the stand-ins were taken
by the agents to a nearby garage where a photograph was taken to
determine through closer study whether the angle of that shot could
have accounted for the wounds in the President’s neck and the Governor’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
back.<a id="FNanchor_C3-305" href="#Footnote_C3-305" class="fnanchor">C3-305</a> A rod was placed at an angle of 17°43’30” next to
the stand-ins for the President and the Governor, who were seated in
the same relative positions.<a id="FNanchor_C3-306" href="#Footnote_C3-306" class="fnanchor">C3-306</a> The wounds of entry and exit on the
President were approximated based on information gained from the
autopsy reports and photographs.<a id="FNanchor_C3-307" href="#Footnote_C3-307" class="fnanchor">C3-307</a> The hole in the back of the jacket
worn by the Governor and the medical description of the wound on his
back marked that entry point.<a id="FNanchor_C3-308" href="#Footnote_C3-308" class="fnanchor">C3-308</a> That line of fire from the sixth floor
of the Depository would have caused the bullet to exit under the Governor’s
right nipple just as the bullet did. Governor Connally’s
doctors measured an angle of declination on his body from the entry
wound on his back to the exit on the front of his chest at about 25°
when he sat erect.<a id="FNanchor_C3-309" href="#Footnote_C3-309" class="fnanchor">C3-309</a> That difference was explained by either a slight
deflection of the bullet caused by striking the fifth rib or the Governor’s
leaning slightly backward at the time he was struck. In addition,
the angle could not be fixed with absolute precision, since the large
wound on the front of his chest precluded an exact determination of
the point of exit.<a id="FNanchor_C3-310" href="#Footnote_C3-310" class="fnanchor">C3-310</a></p>

<p>The alinement of the points of entry was only indicative and not
conclusive that one bullet hit both men. The exact positions of the
men could not be re-created; thus, the angle could only be approximated.<a id="FNanchor_C3-311" href="#Footnote_C3-311" class="fnanchor">C3-311</a>
Had President Kennedy been leaning forward or backward,
the angle of declination of the shot to a perpendicular target would
have varied. The angle of 17°43’30” was approximately the angle
of declination reproduced in an artist’s drawing.<a id="FNanchor_C3-312" href="#Footnote_C3-312" class="fnanchor">C3-312</a> That drawing,
made from data provided by the autopsy surgeons, could not reproduce
the exact line of the bullet, since the exit wound was obliterated by the
tracheotomy. Similarly, if the President or the Governor had been
sitting in a different lateral position, the conclusion might have
varied. Or if the Governor had not turned in exactly the way calculated,
the alinement would have been destroyed.</p>

<p>Additional experiments by the Army Wound Ballistics Branch
further suggested that the same bullet probably passed through both
President Kennedy and Governor Connally. (See app. X, <a href="#Page_582">pp.
582-585</a>.) Correlation of a test simulating the Governor’s chest wound
with the neck and wrist experiments indicated that course. After
reviewing the Parkland Hospital medical records and X-rays of
the Governor and discussing his chest injury with the attending
surgeon, the Army ballistics experts virtually duplicated the wound
using the assassination weapon and animal flesh covered by cloth.<a id="FNanchor_C3-313" href="#Footnote_C3-313" class="fnanchor">C3-313</a>
The bullet that struck the animal flesh displayed characteristics similar
to the bullet found on Governor Connally’s stretcher.<a id="FNanchor_C3-314" href="#Footnote_C3-314" class="fnanchor">C3-314</a> Moreover,
the imprint on the velocity screen immediately behind the animal
flesh showed that the bullet was tumbling after exiting from the flesh,
having lost a total average of 265 feet per second.<a id="FNanchor_C3-315" href="#Footnote_C3-315" class="fnanchor">C3-315</a> Taking into
consideration the Governor’s size, the reduction in velocity of a
bullet passing through his body would be approximately 400 feet per
second.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span><a id="FNanchor_C3-316" href="#Footnote_C3-316" class="fnanchor">C3-316</a></p>

and the President and the wound ballistics tests performed at Edgewood
Arsenal, Drs. Olivier and Arthur J. Dziemian, chief of the
Army Wound Ballistics Branch, who had spent 17 years in that area of
specialization, concluded that it was probable that the same bullet
passed through the President’s neck and then inflicted all the wounds
on the Governor.<a id="FNanchor_C3-317" href="#Footnote_C3-317" class="fnanchor">C3-317</a> Referring to the President’s neck wound and
all the Governor’s wounds, Dr. Dziemian testified: “I think the probability
is very good that it is, that all the wounds were caused by one
bullet.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-318" href="#Footnote_C3-318" class="fnanchor">C3-318</a> Both Drs. Dziemian and Olivier believed that the wound
on the Governor’s wrist would have been more extensive had the
bullet which inflicted that injury merely passed through the Governor’s
chest, exiting at a velocity of approximately 1,500 feet per
second.<a id="FNanchor_C3-319" href="#Footnote_C3-319" class="fnanchor">C3-319</a> Thus, the Governor’s wrist wound suggested that the bullet
passed through the President’s neck, began to yaw in the air between
the President and the Governor, and then lost more velocity than 400
feet per second in passing through the Governor’s chest. A bullet
which was yawing on entering into the Governor’s back would lose
substantially more velocity in passing through his body than a pristine
bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C3-320" href="#Footnote_C3-320" class="fnanchor">C3-320</a> In addition, the bullet that struck the animal flesh was
flattened to a greater extent than the bullet which presumably struck
the Governor’s rib,<a id="FNanchor_C3-321" href="#Footnote_C3-321" class="fnanchor">C3-321</a> which suggests that the bullet which entered the
Governor’s chest had already lost velocity by passing through the
President’s neck. Moreover, the large wound on the Governor’s back
would be explained by a bullet which was yawing, although that type
of wound might also be accounted for by a tangential striking.<a id="FNanchor_C3-322" href="#Footnote_C3-322" class="fnanchor">C3-322</a></p>

<p>Dr. Frederick W. Light, Jr., the third of the wound ballistics experts,
who has been engaged in that specialty at Edgewood Arsenal
since 1951, testified that the anatomical findings were insufficient for
him to formulate a firm opinion as to whether the same bullet did or
did not pass through the President’s neck first before inflicting all
the wounds on Governor Connally.<a id="FNanchor_C3-323" href="#Footnote_C3-323" class="fnanchor">C3-323</a> Based on the other circumstances,
such as the relative positions of the President and the Governor
in the automobile, Dr. Light concluded that it was probable that
the same bullet traversed the President’s neck and inflicted all the
wounds on Governor Connally.<a id="FNanchor_C3-324" href="#Footnote_C3-324" class="fnanchor">C3-324</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr52">The Subsequent Bullet That Hit</h4>

<p>After a bullet penetrated President Kennedy’s neck, a subsequent
shot entered the back of his head and exited through the upper right
portion of his skull. The Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore films show
the instant in the sequence when that bullet struck. (See Commission
Exhibit No. 902, <a href="#Page_108">p. 108</a>.) That impact was evident from the explosion
of the President’s brain tissues from the right side of his head.
The immediately preceding frame from the Zapruder film shows the
President slumped to his left, clutching at his throat, with his chin
close to his chest and his head tilted forward at an angle.<a id="FNanchor_C3-325" href="#Footnote_C3-325" class="fnanchor">C3-325</a> Based
upon information provided by the doctors who conducted the autopsy,
an artist’s drawing depicted the path of the bullet through the President’s
head, with his head being in the same approximate position.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span><a id="FNanchor_C3-326" href="#Footnote_C3-326" class="fnanchor">C3-326</a></p>

<p>By using the Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore motion pictures, the
President’s location at the time the bullet penetrated his head was fixed
with reasonable precision. A careful analysis of the Nix and Muchmore
films led to fixing the exact location of these cameramen. The
point of impact of the bullet on the President’s head was apparent in
all of the movies. At that point in the Nix film a straight line was
plotted from the camera position to a fixed point in the background and
the President’s location along this line was marked on a plat map.<a id="FNanchor_C3-327" href="#Footnote_C3-327" class="fnanchor">C3-327</a>
A similar process was followed with the Muchmore film. The President’s
location on the plat map was identical to that determined from
the Nix film.<a id="FNanchor_C3-328" href="#Footnote_C3-328" class="fnanchor">C3-328</a> The President’s location, established through the Nix
and Muchmore films, was confirmed by comparing his position on the
Zapruder film. This location had hitherto only been approximated,
since there were no landmarks in the background of the Zapruder frame
for alinement purposes other than a portion of a painted line on the
curb.<a id="FNanchor_C3-329" href="#Footnote_C3-329" class="fnanchor">C3-329</a> Through these procedures, it was determined that President
Kennedy was shot in the head when he was 230.8 feet from a point on
the west curbline on Houston Street where it intersected with Elm
Street.<a id="FNanchor_C3-330" href="#Footnote_C3-330" class="fnanchor">C3-330</a> The President was 265.3 feet from the rifle in the sixth-floor
window and at that position the approximate angle of declination was
15°21’.<a id="FNanchor_C3-331" href="#Footnote_C3-331" class="fnanchor">C3-331</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr53">NUMBER OF SHOTS</h3>

<p>The consensus among the witnesses at the scene was that three shots
were fired.<a id="FNanchor_C3-332" href="#Footnote_C3-332" class="fnanchor">C3-332</a> However, some heard only two shots,<a id="FNanchor_C3-333" href="#Footnote_C3-333" class="fnanchor">C3-333</a> while others
testified that they heard four and perhaps as many as five or six
shots.<a id="FNanchor_C3-334" href="#Footnote_C3-334" class="fnanchor">C3-334</a> The difficulty of accurate perception of the sound of gunshots
required careful scrutiny of all of this testimony regarding the number
of shots. The firing of a bullet causes a number of noises: the muzzle
blast, caused by the smashing of the hot gases which propel the bullet
into the relatively stable air at the gun’s muzzle; the noise of the bullet,
caused by the shock wave built up ahead of the bullet’s nose as it
travels through the air; and the noise caused by the impact of the
bullet on its target.<a id="FNanchor_C3-335" href="#Footnote_C3-335" class="fnanchor">C3-335</a> Each noise can be quite sharp and may be
perceived as a separate shot. The tall buildings in the area might
have further distorted the sound.</p>

<p>The physical and other evidence examined by the Commission compels
the conclusion that at least two shots were fired. As discussed
previously, the nearly whole bullet discovered at Parkland Hospital
and the two larger fragments found in the Presidential automobile,
which were identified as coming from the assassination rifle, came
from at least two separate bullets and possibly from three.<a id="FNanchor_C3-336" href="#Footnote_C3-336" class="fnanchor">C3-336</a> The
most convincing evidence relating to the number of shots was provided
by the presence on the sixth floor of three spent cartridges which were
demonstrated to have been fired by the same rifle that fired the bullets
which caused the wounds. It is possible that the assassin carried an
empty shell in the rifle and fired only two shots, with the witnesses
hearing multiple noises made by the same shot. Soon after the three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
empty cartridges were found, officials at the scene decided that three
shots were fired, and that conclusion was widely circulated by the
press. The eyewitness testimony may be subconsciously colored by
the extensive publicity given the conclusion that three shots were fired.
Nevertheless, the preponderance of the evidence, in particular the
three spent cartridges, led the Commission to conclude that there were
three shots fired.</p>

<h3 id="hdr54">THE SHOT THAT MISSED</h3>

<p>From the initial findings that (<i>a</i>) one shot passed through the
President’s neck and then most probably passed through the Governor’s
body, (<i>b</i>) a subsequent shot penetrated the President’s head, (<i>c</i>) no
other shot struck any part of the automobile, and (<i>d</i>) three shots were
fired, it follows that one shot probably missed the car and its occupants.
The evidence is inconclusive as to whether it was the first,
second, or third shot which missed.</p>

<h4 id="hdr55">The First Shot</h4>

<p>If the first shot missed, the assassin perhaps missed in an effort to
fire a hurried shot before the President passed under the oak tree, or
possibly he fired as the President passed under the tree and the tree
obstructed his view. The bullet might have struck a portion of the
tree and been completely deflected. On the other hand, the greatest
cause for doubt that the first shot missed is the improbability that the
same marksman who twice hit a moving target would be so inaccurate
on the first and closest of his shots as to miss completely, not only the
target, but the large automobile.</p>

<p>Some support for the contention that the first shot missed is found
in the statement of Secret Service Agent Glen A. Bennett, stationed in
the right rear seat of the President’s followup car, who heard a sound
like a firecracker as the motorcade proceeded down Elm Street. At
that moment, Agent Bennett stated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * I looked at the back of the President. I heard another
firecracker noise and saw that shot hit the President about four
inches down from the right shoulder. A second shot followed
immediately and hit the right rear high of the President’s head.<a id="FNanchor_C3-337" href="#Footnote_C3-337" class="fnanchor">C3-337</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Substantial weight may be given Bennett’s observations. Although
his formal statement was dated November 23, 1963, his notes indicate
that he recorded what he saw and heard at 5:30 p.m., November 22,
1963, on the airplane en route back to Washington, prior to the autopsy,
when it was not yet known that the President had been hit in the
back.<a id="FNanchor_C3-338" href="#Footnote_C3-338" class="fnanchor">C3-338</a> It is possible, of course, that Bennett did not observe the hole
in the President’s back, which might have been there immediately
after the first noise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Governor Connally’s testimony supports the view that the first
shot missed, because he stated that he heard a shot, turned slightly
to his right, and, as he started to turn back toward his left, was struck
by the second bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C3-339" href="#Footnote_C3-339" class="fnanchor">C3-339</a> He never saw the President during the shooting
sequence, and it is entirely possible that he heard the missed shot
and that both men were struck by the second bullet. Mrs. Connally
testified that after the first shot she turned and saw the President’s
hands moving toward his throat, as seen in the films at frame 225.<a id="FNanchor_C3-340" href="#Footnote_C3-340" class="fnanchor">C3-340</a>
However, Mrs. Connally further stated that she thought her husband
was hit immediately thereafter by the second bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C3-341" href="#Footnote_C3-341" class="fnanchor">C3-341</a> If the same
bullet struck both the President and the Governor, it is entirely possible
that she saw the President’s movements at the same time as she heard
the second shot. Her testimony, therefore, does not preclude the possibility
of the first shot having missed.</p>

<p>Other eyewitness testimony, however, supports the conclusion that
the first of the shots fired hit the President. As discussed in chapter
II, Special Agent Hill’s testimony indicates that the President was
hit by the first shot and that the head injury was caused by a second
shot which followed about 5 seconds later. James W. Altgens, a
photographer in Dallas for the Associated Press, had stationed himself
on Elm Street opposite the Depository to take pictures of the passing
motorcade. Altgens took a widely circulated photograph which
showed President Kennedy reacting to the first of the two shots which
hit him. (See Commission Exhibit No. 900, <a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>.) According to
Altgens, he snapped the picture “almost simultaneously” with a shot
which he is confident was the first one fired.<a id="FNanchor_C3-342" href="#Footnote_C3-342" class="fnanchor">C3-342</a> Comparison of his
photograph with the Zapruder film, however, revealed that Altgens
took his picture at approximately the same moment as frame 255 of
the movie, 30 to 45 frames (approximately 2 seconds) later than the
point at which the President was shot in the neck.<a id="FNanchor_C3-343" href="#Footnote_C3-343" class="fnanchor">C3-343</a> (See Commission
Exhibit No. 901, <a href="#Page_114">p. 114</a>.) Another photographer, Phillip L. Willis,
snapped a picture at a time which he also asserts was simultaneous
with the first shot. Analysis of his photograph revealed that it was
taken at approximately frame 210 of the Zapruder film, which was the
approximate time of the shot that probably hit the President and the
Governor. If Willis accurately recalled that there were no previous
shots, this would be strong evidence that the first shot did not miss.<a id="FNanchor_C3-344" href="#Footnote_C3-344" class="fnanchor">C3-344</a></p>

<p>If the first shot did not miss, there must be an explanation for Governor
Connally’s recollection that he was not hit by it. There was,
conceivably, a delayed reaction between the time the bullet struck him
and the time he realized that he was hit, despite the fact that the bullet
struck a glancing blow to a rib and penetrated his wrist bone. The
Governor did not even know that he had been struck in the wrist or
in the thigh until he regained consciousness in the hospital the next
day. Moreover, he testified that he did not hear what he thought
was the second shot, although he did hear a subsequent shot which
coincided with the shattering of the President’s head.<a id="FNanchor_C3-345" href="#Footnote_C3-345" class="fnanchor">C3-345</a> One possibility,
therefore, would be a sequence in which the Governor heard
the first shot, did not immediately feel the penetration of the bullet,
then felt the delayed reaction of the impact on his back, later heard the
shot which shattered the President’s head, and then lost consciousness
without hearing a third shot which might have occurred later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<h4 id="hdr56">The Second Shot</h4>

<p>The possibility that the second shot missed is consistent with the
elapsed time between the two shots that hit their mark. From the
timing evidenced by the Zapruder films, there was an interval of from
4.8 to 5.6 seconds between the shot which struck President Kennedy’s
neck (between frames 210 to 225) and the shot which struck his head
at frame 313.<a id="FNanchor_C3-346" href="#Footnote_C3-346" class="fnanchor">C3-346</a> Since a minimum of 2.3 seconds must elapse between
shots, a bullet could have been fired from the rifle and missed
during this interval.<a id="FNanchor_C3-347" href="#Footnote_C3-347" class="fnanchor">C3-347</a> This possibility was buttressed by the testimony
of witnesses who claimed that the shots were evenly spaced,
since a second shot occurring within an interval of approximately 5
seconds would have to be almost exactly midway in this period. If
Altgens’ recollection is correct that he snapped his picture at the same
moment as he heard a shot, then it is possible that he heard a second
shot which missed, since a shot fired 2.3 seconds before he took his
picture at frame 255 could have hit the President at about frame 213.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a substantial majority of the witnesses stated
that the shots were not evenly spaced. Most witnesses recalled that
the second and third shots were bunched together, although some
believed that it was the first and second which were bunched.<a id="FNanchor_C3-348" href="#Footnote_C3-348" class="fnanchor">C3-348</a> To the
extent that reliance can be placed on recollection of witnesses as to the
spacing of the shots, the testimony that the shots were not evenly
spaced would militate against a second shot missing. Another factor
arguing against the second shot missing is that the gunman would have
been shooting at very near the minimum allowable time to have fired
the three shots within 4.8 to 5.6 seconds, although it was entirely possible
for him to have done so. (See ch. IV, <a href="#Page_188">pp. 188-194</a>.)</p>

<h4 id="hdr57">The Third Shot</h4>

<p>The last possibility, of course, is that it was the third shot which
missed. This conclusion conforms most easily with the probability
that the assassin would most likely have missed the farthest shot,
particularly since there was an acceleration of the automobile after
the shot which struck the President’s head. The limousine also
changed direction by following the curve to the right, whereas previously
it had been proceeding in almost a straight line with a rifle
protruding from the sixth-floor window of the Depository Building.</p>

<p>One must consider, however, the testimony of the witnesses
who described the head shot as the concluding event in the assassination
sequence. Illustrative is the testimony of Associated
Press photographer Altgens, who had an excellent vantage point
near the President’s car. He recalled that the shot which hit the President’s
head “was the last shot—that much I will say with a great degree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
of certainty.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-349" href="#Footnote_C3-349" class="fnanchor">C3-349</a> On the other hand, Emmett J. Hudson, the groundskeeper
of Dealey Plaza, testified that from his position on Elm Street,
midway between Houston Street and the Triple Underpass, he heard
a third shot after the shot which hit the President in the head.<a id="FNanchor_C3-350" href="#Footnote_C3-350" class="fnanchor">C3-350</a> In
addition, Mrs. Kennedy’s testimony indicated that neither the first
nor the second shot missed. Immediately after the first noise she
turned, because of the Governor’s yell, and saw her husband raise
his hand to his forehead. Then the second shot struck the President’s
head.<a id="FNanchor_C3-351" href="#Footnote_C3-351" class="fnanchor">C3-351</a></p>

<p>Some evidence suggested that a third shot may have entirely missed
and hit the turf or street by the Triple Underpass. Royce G. Skelton,
who watched the motorcade from the railroad bridge, testified that
after two shots “the car came on down close to the Triple Underpass”
and an additional shot “hit in the left front of the President’s car on
the cement.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-352" href="#Footnote_C3-352" class="fnanchor">C3-352</a> Skelton thought that there had been a total of four
shots, either the third or fourth of which hit in the vicinity of the underpass.<a id="FNanchor_C3-353" href="#Footnote_C3-353" class="fnanchor">C3-353</a>
Dallas Patrolman J. W. Foster, who was also on the
Triple Underpass, testified that a shot hit the turf near a manhole
cover in the vicinity of the underpass.<a id="FNanchor_C3-354" href="#Footnote_C3-354" class="fnanchor">C3-354</a> Examination of this area,
however, disclosed no indication that a bullet struck at the locations
indicated by Skelton or Foster.<a id="FNanchor_C3-355" href="#Footnote_C3-355" class="fnanchor">C3-355</a></p>

<p>At a different location in Dealey Plaza, the evidence indicated that
a bullet fragment did hit the street. James T. Tague, who got out of
his car to watch the motorcade from a position between Commerce and
Main Streets near the Triple Underpass, was hit on the cheek by an
object during the shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C3-356" href="#Footnote_C3-356" class="fnanchor">C3-356</a> Within a few minutes Tague reported
this to Deputy Sheriff Eddy R. Walthers, who was examining the area
to see if any bullets had struck the turf.<a id="FNanchor_C3-357" href="#Footnote_C3-357" class="fnanchor">C3-357</a> Walthers immediately
started to search where Tague had been standing and located a place
on the south curb of Main Street where it appeared a bullet had hit the
cement.<a id="FNanchor_C3-358" href="#Footnote_C3-358" class="fnanchor">C3-358</a> According to Tague, “There was a mark quite obviously
that was a bullet, and it was very fresh.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-359" href="#Footnote_C3-359" class="fnanchor">C3-359</a> In Tague’s opinion, it was
the second shot which caused the mark, since he thinks he heard the
third shot after he was hit in the face.<a id="FNanchor_C3-360" href="#Footnote_C3-360" class="fnanchor">C3-360</a> This incident appears to
have been recorded in the contemporaneous report of Dallas Patrolman
L. L. Hill, who radioed in around 12:40 p.m.: “I have one guy
that was possibly hit by a richochet from the bullet off the concrete.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-361" href="#Footnote_C3-361" class="fnanchor">C3-361</a>
Scientific examination of the mark on the south curb of Main Street by
FBI experts disclosed metal smears which, “were spectrographically
determined to be essentially lead with a trace of antimony.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-362" href="#Footnote_C3-362" class="fnanchor">C3-362</a> The
mark on the curb could have originated from the lead core of a bullet
but the absence of copper precluded “the possibility that the mark on
the curbing section was made by an unmutilated military full
metal-jacketed bullet such as the bullet from Governor Connally’s
stretcher.”<a id="FNanchor_C3-363" href="#Footnote_C3-363" class="fnanchor">C3-363</a></p>

<p>It is true that the noise of a subsequent shot might have been drowned
out by the siren on the Secret Service followup car immediately after
the head shot, or the dramatic effect of the head shot might have caused
so much confusion that the memory of subsequent events was blurred.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
Nevertheless, the preponderance of the eyewitness testimony that the
head shot was the final shot must be weighed in any determination as
to whether it was the third shot that missed. Even if it were caused
by a bullet fragment, the mark on the south curb of Main Street cannot
be identified conclusively with any of the three shots fired. Under the
circumstances it might have come from the bullet which hit the President’s
head, or it might have been a product of the fragmentation of
the missed shot upon hitting some other object in the area.<a id="FNanchor_C3-364" href="#Footnote_C3-364" class="fnanchor">C3-364</a> Since he
did not observe any of the shots striking the President, Tague’s
testimony that the second shot, rather than the third, caused the
scratch on his cheek, does not assist in limiting the possibilities.</p>

<p>The wide range of possibilities and the existence of conflicting
testimony, when coupled with the impossibility of scientific verification,
precludes a conclusive finding by the Commission as to which
shot missed.</p>

<h3 id="hdr58">TIME SPAN OF SHOTS</h3>

<p>Witnesses at the assassination scene said that the shots were fired
within a few seconds, with the general estimate being 5 to 6 seconds.<a id="FNanchor_C3-365" href="#Footnote_C3-365" class="fnanchor">C3-365</a>
That approximation was most probably based on the earlier publicized
reports that the first shot struck the President in the neck, the second
wounded the Governor and the third shattered the President’s
head, with the time span from the neck to the head shots on the President
being approximately 5 seconds. As previously indicated, the
time span between the shot entering the back of the President’s neck
and the bullet which shattered his skull was 4.8 to 5.6 seconds. If the
second shot missed, then 4.8 to 5.6 seconds was the total time span of the
shots. If either the first or third shots missed, then a minimum of 2.3
seconds (necessary to operate the rifle) must be added to the time span
of the shots which hit, giving a minimum time of 7.1 to 7.9 seconds for
the three shots. If more than 2.3 seconds elapsed between a shot that
missed and one that hit, then the time span would be correspondingly
increased.</p>

<h3 id="hdr59">CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>Based on the evidence analyzed in this chapter, the Commission has
concluded that the shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded
Governor Connally were fired from the sixth-floor window at the
southeast corner of the Texas School Book Depository Building. Two
bullets probably caused all the wounds suffered by President Kennedy
and Governor Connally. Since the preponderance of the evidence
indicated that three shots were fired, the Commission concluded that
one shot probably missed the Presidential limousine and its occupants,
and that the three shots were fired in a time period ranging from
approximately 4.8 to in excess of 7 seconds.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> preceding chapter has established that the bullets
which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally
were fired from the southeast corner window of the sixth
floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building and that the
weapon which fired these bullets was a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter
Italian rifle bearing the serial number C2766. In this chapter

concerning the identity of the assassin. This evidence includes
(1) the ownership and possession of the weapon used to commit the
assassination, (2) the means by which the weapon was brought into
the Depository Building, (3) the identity of the person present at the
window from which the shots were fired, (4) the killing of Dallas
Patrolman J.D. Tippit within 45 minutes after the assassination,
(5) the resistance to arrest and the attempted shooting of another
police officer by the man (Lee Harvey Oswald) subsequently accused
of assassinating President Kennedy and killing Patrolman Tippit, (6)
the lies told to the police by Oswald, (7) the evidence linking Oswald
to the attempted killing of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker (Resigned,
U.S. Army) on April 10, 1963, and (8) Oswald’s capability with a
rifle.</p>

<h3 id="hdr61">OWNERSHIP AND POSSESSION OF ASSASSINATION WEAPON</h3>

<h4 id="hdr62">Purchase of Rifle by Oswald</h4>

<p>Shortly after the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle was found on the sixth
floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building,<a id="FNanchor_C4-1" href="#Footnote_C4-1" class="fnanchor">C4-1</a> agents of the
FBI learned from retail outlets in Dallas that Crescent Firearms,
Inc., of New York City, was a distributor of surplus Italian 6.5-millimeter
military rifles.<a id="FNanchor_C4-2" href="#Footnote_C4-2" class="fnanchor">C4-2</a> During the evening of November 22, 1963,
a review of the records of Crescent Firearms revealed that the
firm had shipped an Italian carbine, serial number C2766, to Klein’s
Sporting Goods Co., of Chicago, Ill.<a id="FNanchor_C4-3" href="#Footnote_C4-3" class="fnanchor">C4-3</a> After searching their records
from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. the officers of Klein’s discovered that a rifle
bearing serial number C2766 had been shipped to one A. Hidell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
Post Office Box 2915, Dallas, Tex., on March 20, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-4" href="#Footnote_C4-4" class="fnanchor">C4-4</a> (See Waldman
Exhibit No. 7, <a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>.)</p>

<p>According to its microfilm records, Klein’s received an order for a
rifle on March 13, 1963, on a coupon clipped from the February 1963
issue of the American Rifleman magazine. The order coupon was
signed, in handprinting, “A. Hidell, P.O. Box 2915, Dallas, Texas.”
(See Commission Exhibit No. 773, <a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>.) It was sent in an envelope
bearing the same name and return address in handwriting.
Document examiners for the Treasury Department and the FBI
testified unequivocally that the bold printing on the face of the mail-order
coupon was in the handprinting of Lee Harvey Oswald and that
the writing on the envelope was also his.<a id="FNanchor_C4-5" href="#Footnote_C4-5" class="fnanchor">C4-5</a> Oswald’s writing on these
and other documents was identified by comparing the writing and
printing on the documents in question with that appearing on documents
known to have been written by Oswald, such as his letters, passport
application, and endorsements of checks.<a id="FNanchor_C4-6" href="#Footnote_C4-6" class="fnanchor">C4-6</a> (See app. X, <a href="#Page_568">p.
568-569</a>.)</p>

<p>In addition to the order coupon the envelope contained a U.S.
postal money order for $21.45, purchased as No. 2,202,130,462 in
Dallas, Tex., on March 12, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-7" href="#Footnote_C4-7" class="fnanchor">C4-7</a> The canceled money order was
obtained from the Post Office Department. Opposite the printed
words “Pay To” were written the words “Kleins Sporting Goods,”
and opposite the printed word “From” were written the words “A.
Hidell, P.O. Box 2915 Dallas, Texas.” These words were also in
the handwriting of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-8" href="#Footnote_C4-8" class="fnanchor">C4-8</a> (See Commission Exhibit
No. 788, <a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>.)</p>

<p>From Klein’s records it was possible to trace the processing of the
order after its receipt. A bank deposit made on March 13, 1963, included
an item of $21.45. Klein’s shipping order form shows an imprint
made by the cash register which recorded the receipt of $21.45 on
March 13, 1963. This price included $19.95 for the rifle and the scope,
and $1.50 for postage and handling. The rifle without the scope cost
only $12.78.<a id="FNanchor_C4-9" href="#Footnote_C4-9" class="fnanchor">C4-9</a></p>

<p>According to the vice president of Klein’s, William Waldman, the
scope was mounted on the rifle by a gunsmith employed by Klein’s,
and the rifle was shipped fully assembled in accordance with customary
company procedures.<a id="FNanchor_C4-10" href="#Footnote_C4-10" class="fnanchor">C4-10</a> The specific rifle shipped against the order
had been received by Klein’s from Crescent on February 21, 1963.
It bore the manufacturer’s serial number C2766. On that date, Klein’s
placed an internal control number VC836 on this rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C4-11" href="#Footnote_C4-11" class="fnanchor">C4-11</a> According
to Klein’s shipping order form, one Italian carbine 6.5 X-4× scope,
control number VC836, serial number C2766, was shipped parcel post
to “A. Hidell, P.O. Box 2915, Dallas, Texas,” on March 20, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-12" href="#Footnote_C4-12" class="fnanchor">C4-12</a>
Information received from the Italian Armed Forces Intelligence
Service has established that this particular rifle was the only rifle of
its type bearing serial number C2766.<a id="FNanchor_C4-13" href="#Footnote_C4-13" class="fnanchor">C4-13</a> (See app. X, <a href="#Page_554">p. 554</a>.)</p>

<p>The post office box to which the rifle was shipped was rented to
“Lee H. Oswald” from October 9, 1962, to May 14, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-14" href="#Footnote_C4-14" class="fnanchor">C4-14</a> Experts
on handwriting identification from the Treasury Department and the
FBI testified that the signature and other writing on the application
for that box were in the handwriting of Lee Harvey Oswald,<a id="FNanchor_C4-15" href="#Footnote_C4-15" class="fnanchor">C4-15</a> as
was a change-of-address card dated May 12, 1963,<a id="FNanchor_C4-16" href="#Footnote_C4-16" class="fnanchor">C4-16</a> by which Oswald
requested that mail addressed to that box be forwarded to him in
New Orleans, where he had moved on April 24.<a id="FNanchor_C4-17" href="#Footnote_C4-17" class="fnanchor">C4-17</a> Since the rifle
was shipped from Chicago on March 20, 1963, it was received in Dallas
during the period when Oswald rented and used the box. (See Commission
Exhibit No. 791, <a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>.)</p>

It is not known whether the application for post office box 2915
listed “A. Hidell” as a person entitled to receive mail at this box.
In accordance with postal regulations, the portion of the application
which lists names of persons, other than the applicant, entitled to receive
mail was thrown away after the box was closed on May 14,
1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-18" href="#Footnote_C4-18" class="fnanchor">C4-18</a> Postal Inspector Harry D. Holmes of the Dallas Post Office
testified, however, that when a package is received for a certain box,
a notice is placed in that box regardless of whether the name on the
package is listed on the application as a person entitled to receive mail
through that box. The person having access to the box then takes the
notice to the window and is given the package. Ordinarily, Inspector
Holmes testified, identification is not requested because it is assumed
that the person with the notice is entitled to the package.<a id="FNanchor_C4-19" href="#Footnote_C4-19" class="fnanchor">C4-19</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s use of the name “Hidell” to purchase the assassination
weapon was one of several instances in which he used this name as
an alias. When arrested on the day of the assassination, he had in
his possession a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 caliber revolver<a id="FNanchor_C4-20" href="#Footnote_C4-20" class="fnanchor">C4-20</a> purchased by
mail-order coupon from Seaport-Traders, Inc., a mail-order division
of George Rose &amp; Co., Los Angeles. The mail-order coupon listed
the purchaser as “A. J. Hidell Age 28” with the address of post office
box 2915 in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C4-21" href="#Footnote_C4-21" class="fnanchor">C4-21</a> Handwriting experts from the FBI and
the Treasury Department testified that the writing on the mail-order
form was that of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-22" href="#Footnote_C4-22" class="fnanchor">C4-22</a></p>

<p>Among other identification cards in Oswald’s wallet at the time of
his arrest were a Selective Service notice of classification, a Selective
Service registration certificate,<a id="FNanchor_C4-23" href="#Footnote_C4-23" class="fnanchor">C4-23</a> and a certificate of service in the U.S.
Marine Corps,<a id="FNanchor_C4-24" href="#Footnote_C4-24" class="fnanchor">C4-24</a> all three cards being in his own name. Also in his
wallet at that time were a Selective Service notice of classification and
a Marine certificate of service in the name of Alek James
Hidell.<a id="FNanchor_C4-25" href="#Footnote_C4-25" class="fnanchor">C4-25</a> On the Hidell Selective Service card there appeared
a signature, “Alek J. Hidell,” and the photograph of Lee
Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-26" href="#Footnote_C4-26" class="fnanchor">C4-26</a> Experts on questioned documents from the
Treasury Department and the FBI testified that the Hidell cards
were counterfeit photographic reproductions made by photographing
the Oswald cards, retouching the resulting negatives, and producing
prints from the retouched negatives. The Hidell signature on the
notice of classification was in the handwriting of Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-27" href="#Footnote_C4-27" class="fnanchor">C4-27</a> (See app.
X, <a href="#Page_572">p. 572</a>.)</p>

<p>In Oswald’s personal effects found in his room at 1026 North Beckley
Avenue in Dallas was a purported international certificate of vaccination
signed by “Dr. A. J. Hideel,” Post Office Box 30016, New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_C4-28" href="#Footnote_C4-28" class="fnanchor">C4-28</a> It certified that Lee Harvey Oswald had been vaccinated
for smallpox on June 8, 1963. This, too, was a forgery. The signature
of “A. J. Hideel” was in the handwriting of Lee Harvey
Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-29" href="#Footnote_C4-29" class="fnanchor">C4-29</a> There is no “Dr. Hideel” licensed to practice medicine in
Louisiana.<a id="FNanchor_C4-30" href="#Footnote_C4-30" class="fnanchor">C4-30</a> There is no post office box 30016 in the New Orleans Post
Office but Oswald had rented post office box 30061 in New Orleans<a id="FNanchor_C4-31" href="#Footnote_C4-31" class="fnanchor">C4-31</a> on
June 3, 1963, listing Marina Oswald and A. J. Hidell as additional
persons entitled to receive mail in the box.<a id="FNanchor_C4-32" href="#Footnote_C4-32" class="fnanchor">C4-32</a> The New Orleans postal
authorities had not discarded the portion of the application listing
the names of those, other than the owner of the box, entitled to receive
mail through the box. Expert testimony confirmed that the
writing on this application was that of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-33" href="#Footnote_C4-33" class="fnanchor">C4-33</a></p>

<p>Hidell’s name on the post office box application was part of Oswald’s
use of a nonexistent Hidell to serve as president of the so-called
New Orleans Chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. (As
discussed below in ch. VI, <a href="#Page_292">p. 292</a>.) Marina Oswald testified that she
first learned of Oswald’s use of the fictitious name “Hidell” in connection
with his pro-Castro activities in New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_C4-34" href="#Footnote_C4-34" class="fnanchor">C4-34</a> According
to her testimony, he compelled her to write the name “Hidell” on membership
cards in the space designated for the signature of the “Chapter
President.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-35" href="#Footnote_C4-35" class="fnanchor">C4-35</a> The name “Hidell” was stamped on some of the
“Chapter’s” printed literature and on the membership application
blanks.<a id="FNanchor_C4-36" href="#Footnote_C4-36" class="fnanchor">C4-36</a> Marina Oswald testified, “I knew there was no such organization.
And I know Hidell is merely an altered Fidel, and I
laughed at such foolishness.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-37" href="#Footnote_C4-37" class="fnanchor">C4-37</a> Hidell was a fictitious president of an
organization of which Oswald was the only member.<a id="FNanchor_C4-38" href="#Footnote_C4-38" class="fnanchor">C4-38</a></p>

<p>When seeking employment in New Orleans, Oswald listed a “Sgt.
Robt. Hidell” as a reference on one job application<a id="FNanchor_C4-39" href="#Footnote_C4-39" class="fnanchor">C4-39</a> and “George
Hidell” as a reference on another.<a id="FNanchor_C4-40" href="#Footnote_C4-40" class="fnanchor">C4-40</a> Both names were found to be
fictitious.<a id="FNanchor_C4-41" href="#Footnote_C4-41" class="fnanchor">C4-41</a> Moreover, the use of “Alek” as a first name for Hidell
is a further link to Oswald because “Alek” was Oswald’s nickname
in Russia.<a id="FNanchor_C4-42" href="#Footnote_C4-42" class="fnanchor">C4-42</a> Letters received by Marina Oswald from her husband
signed “Alek” were given to the Commission.<a id="FNanchor_C4-43" href="#Footnote_C4-43" class="fnanchor">C4-43</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr63">Oswald’s Palmprint on Rifle Barrel</h4>

<p>Based on the above evidence, the Commission concluded that Oswald
purchased the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building.
Additional evidence of ownership was provided in the form of palmprint
identification which indicated that Oswald had possession of
the rifle he had purchased.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the rifle was discovered on the sixth floor of
the Depository Building<a id="FNanchor_C4-44" href="#Footnote_C4-44" class="fnanchor">C4-44</a> it was examined by Lt. J. C. Day of the
identification bureau of the Dallas police. He lifted the rifle by the
wooden stock after his examination convinced him that the wood
was too rough to take fingerprints. Capt. J. W. Fritz then ejected a
cartridge by operating the bolt, but only after Day viewed the knob
on the bolt through a magnifying glass and found no prints.<a id="FNanchor_C4-45" href="#Footnote_C4-45" class="fnanchor">C4-45</a> Day
continued to examine the rifle with the magnifying glass, looking for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
possible fingerprints. He applied fingerprint powder to the side of
the metal housing near the trigger, and noticed traces of two prints.<a id="FNanchor_C4-46" href="#Footnote_C4-46" class="fnanchor">C4-46</a>
At 11:45 p.m. on November 22, the rifle was released to the FBI and
forwarded to Washington where it was examined on the morning of
November 23 by Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the Latent Fingerprint
Section of the FBI’s Identification Division.<a id="FNanchor_C4-47" href="#Footnote_C4-47" class="fnanchor">C4-47</a></p>

<p>In his testimony before the Commission, Latona stated that when
he received the rifle, the area where prints were visible was protected
by cellophane.<a id="FNanchor_C4-48" href="#Footnote_C4-48" class="fnanchor">C4-48</a> He examined these prints, as well as photographs
of them which the Dallas police had made, and concluded that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * the formations, the ridge formations and characteristics,
were insufficient for purposes of either effecting identification or a
determination that the print was not identical with the prints of
people. Accordingly, my opinion simply was that the latent
prints which were there were of no value.<a id="FNanchor_C4-49" href="#Footnote_C4-49" class="fnanchor">C4-49</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Latona then processed the complete weapon but developed no
identifiable prints.<a id="FNanchor_C4-50" href="#Footnote_C4-50" class="fnanchor">C4-50</a> He stated that the poor quality of the wood
and the metal would cause the rifle to absorb moisture from the skin,
thereby making a clear print unlikely.<a id="FNanchor_C4-51" href="#Footnote_C4-51" class="fnanchor">C4-51</a></p>

<p>On November 22, however, before surrendering possession of the
rifle to the FBI Laboratory, Lieutenant Day of the Dallas Police Department
had “lifted” a palmprint from the underside of the gun barrel
“near the firing end of the barrel about 3 inches under the
Woodstock when I took the Woodstock loose.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-52" href="#Footnote_C4-52" class="fnanchor">C4-52</a> “Lifting” a print involves
the use of adhesive material to remove the fingerprint powder
which adheres to the original print. In this way the powdered impression
is actually removed from the object.<a id="FNanchor_C4-53" href="#Footnote_C4-53" class="fnanchor">C4-53</a> The lifting had been
so complete in this case that there was no trace of the print on the
rifle itself when it was examined by Latona. Nor was there any indication
that the lift had been performed.<a id="FNanchor_C4-54" href="#Footnote_C4-54" class="fnanchor">C4-54</a> Day, on the other
hand, believed that sufficient traces of the print had been left on the
rifle barrel, because he did not release the lifted print until November
26, when he received instructions to send “everything that we
had” to the FBI.<a id="FNanchor_C4-55" href="#Footnote_C4-55" class="fnanchor">C4-55</a> The print arrived in the FBI Laboratory in
Washington on November 29, mounted on a card on which Lieutenant
Day had written the words “off underside gun barrel near end of foregrip
C2766.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-56" href="#Footnote_C4-56" class="fnanchor">C4-56</a> The print’s positive identity as having been lifted
from the rifle was confirmed by FBI Laboratory tests which established
that the adhesive material bearing the print also bore impressions
of the same irregularities that appeared on the barrel of the
rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C4-57" href="#Footnote_C4-57" class="fnanchor">C4-57</a></p>

<p>Latona testified that this palmprint was the right palmprint of
Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-58" href="#Footnote_C4-58" class="fnanchor">C4-58</a> At the request of the Commission, Arthur
Mandella, fingerprint expert with the New York City Police Department,
conducted an independent examination and also determined
that this was the right palmprint of Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-59" href="#Footnote_C4-59" class="fnanchor">C4-59</a> Latona’s findings
were also confirmed by Ronald G. Wittmus, another FBI fingerprint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
expert.<a id="FNanchor_C4-60" href="#Footnote_C4-60" class="fnanchor">C4-60</a> In the opinion of these experts, it was not possible to estimate
the time which elapsed between the placing of the print on the
rifle and the date of the lift.<a id="FNanchor_C4-61" href="#Footnote_C4-61" class="fnanchor">C4-61</a></p>

<p>Experts testifying before the Commission agreed that palmprints
are as unique as fingerprints for purposes of establishing identification.<a id="FNanchor_C4-62" href="#Footnote_C4-62" class="fnanchor">C4-62</a>
Oswald’s palmprint on the underside of the barrel demonstrates
that he handled the rifle when it was disassembled. A palmprint
could not be placed on this portion of the rifle, when assembled,
because the wooden foregrip covers the barrel at this point.<a id="FNanchor_C4-63" href="#Footnote_C4-63" class="fnanchor">C4-63</a> The
print is additional proof that the rifle was in Oswald’s possession.</p>

<h4 id="hdr64">Fibers on Rifle</h4>

<p>In a crevice between the butt plate of the rifle and the wooden
stock was a tuft of several cotton fibers of dark blue, gray-black, and
orange-yellow shades.<a id="FNanchor_C4-64" href="#Footnote_C4-64" class="fnanchor">C4-64</a> On November 23, 1963, these fibers were
examined by Paul M. Stombaugh, a special agent assigned to the Hair
and Fiber Unit of the FBI Laboratory.<a id="FNanchor_C4-65" href="#Footnote_C4-65" class="fnanchor">C4-65</a> He compared them with
the fibers found in the shirt which Oswald was wearing when arrested
in the Texas Theatre.<a id="FNanchor_C4-66" href="#Footnote_C4-66" class="fnanchor">C4-66</a> This shirt was also composed of dark
blue, gray-black and orange-yellow cotton fibers. Stombaugh testified
that the colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft
on the rifle matched those in Oswald’s shirt.<a id="FNanchor_C4-67" href="#Footnote_C4-67" class="fnanchor">C4-67</a> (See app. X, <a href="#Page_592">p. 592</a>.)</p>

<p>Stombaugh explained in his testimony that in fiber analysis, as
distinct from fingerprint or firearms identification, it is not possible
to state with scientific certainty that a particular small group of
fibers come from a certain piece of clothing to the exclusion of all
others because there are not enough microscopic characteristics present
in fibers.<a id="FNanchor_C4-68" href="#Footnote_C4-68" class="fnanchor">C4-68</a> Judgments as to probability will depend on the number
and types of matches.<a id="FNanchor_C4-69" href="#Footnote_C4-69" class="fnanchor">C4-69</a> He concluded, “There is no doubt
in my mind that these fibers could have come from this shirt. There
is no way, however, to eliminate the possibility of the fibers having
come from another identical shirt.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-70" href="#Footnote_C4-70" class="fnanchor">C4-70</a></p>

<p>Having considered the probabilities as explained in Stombaugh’s
testimony, the Commission has concluded that the fibers in the tuft
on the rifle most probably came from the shirt worn by Oswald when
he was arrested, and that this was the same shirt which Oswald wore on
the morning of the assassination. Marina Oswald testified that she
thought her husband wore this shirt to work on that day.<a id="FNanchor_C4-71" href="#Footnote_C4-71" class="fnanchor">C4-71</a> The testimony
of those who saw him after the assassination was inconclusive
about the color of Oswald’s shirt,<a id="FNanchor_C4-72" href="#Footnote_C4-72" class="fnanchor">C4-72</a> but Mary Bledsoe, a former landlady
of Oswald, saw him on a bus approximately 10 minutes after
the assassination and identified the shirt as being the one worn by
Oswald primarily because of a distinctive hole in the shirt’s right
elbow.<a id="FNanchor_C4-73" href="#Footnote_C4-73" class="fnanchor">C4-73</a> Moreover, the bus transfer which he obtained as he left the
bus was still in the pocket when he was arrested.<a id="FNanchor_C4-74" href="#Footnote_C4-74" class="fnanchor">C4-74</a> Although Oswald
returned to his roominghouse after the assassination and when questioned
by the police, claimed to have changed his shirt,<a id="FNanchor_C4-75" href="#Footnote_C4-75" class="fnanchor">C4-75</a> the evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
indicates that he continued wearing the same shirt which he was wearing
all morning and which he was still wearing when arrested.</p>

<p>In light of these findings the Commission evaluated the additional
testimony of Stombaugh that the fibers were caught in the crevice of
the rifle’s butt plate “in the recent past.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-76" href="#Footnote_C4-76" class="fnanchor">C4-76</a> Although Stombaugh
was unable to estimate the period of time the fibers were on the rifle
he said that the fibers “were clean, they had good color to them, there
was no grease on them and they were not fragmented. They looked
as if they had just been picked up.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-77" href="#Footnote_C4-77" class="fnanchor">C4-77</a> The relative freshness of the
fibers is strong evidence that they were caught on the rifle on the
morning of the assassination or during the preceding evening. For
10 days prior to the eve of the assassination Oswald had not been present
at Ruth Paine’s house in Irving, Tex.,<a id="FNanchor_C4-78" href="#Footnote_C4-78" class="fnanchor">C4-78</a> where the rifle was kept.<a id="FNanchor_C4-79" href="#Footnote_C4-79" class="fnanchor">C4-79</a>
Moreover, the Commission found no reliable evidence that Oswald
used the rifle at any time between September 23, when it was transported
from New Orleans, and November 22, the day of the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C4-80" href="#Footnote_C4-80" class="fnanchor">C4-80</a>
The fact that on the morning of the assassination Oswald was
wearing the shirt from which these relatively fresh fibers most probably
originated, provides some evidence that they were placed on the
rifle that day since there was limited, if any, opportunity for Oswald
to handle the weapon during the 2 months prior to November 22.</p>

<p>On the other hand Stombaugh pointed out that fibers might retain
their freshness if the rifle had been “put aside” after catching the fibers.
The rifle used in the assassination probably had been wrapped in a
blanket for about 8 weeks prior to November 22.<a id="FNanchor_C4-81" href="#Footnote_C4-81" class="fnanchor">C4-81</a> Because the relative
freshness of these fibers might be explained by the continuous
storage of the rifle in the blanket, the Commission was unable to reach
any firm conclusion as to when the fibers were caught in the rifle. The
Commission was able to conclude, however, that the fibers most probably
came from Oswald’s shirt. This adds to the conviction of the
Commission that Oswald owned and handled the weapon used in the
assassination.</p>

<h4 id="hdr65">Photograph of Oswald With Rifle</h4>

<p>During the period from March 2, 1963, to April 24, 1963, the
Oswalds lived on Neely Street in Dallas in a rented house which
had a small back yard.<a id="FNanchor_C4-82" href="#Footnote_C4-82" class="fnanchor">C4-82</a> One Sunday, while his wife was hanging
diapers, Oswald asked her to take a picture of him holding a rifle, a
pistol and issues of two newspapers later identified as the Worker
and the Militant.<a id="FNanchor_C4-83" href="#Footnote_C4-83" class="fnanchor">C4-83</a> Two pictures were taken. The Commission
has concluded that the rifle shown in these pictures is the same rifle
which was found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building on
November 22, 1963. (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 133-A and
133-B, <a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a>.)</p>

<p>One of these pictures, Exhibit No. 133-A, shows most of the rifle’s
configuration.<a id="FNanchor_C4-84" href="#Footnote_C4-84" class="fnanchor">C4-84</a> Special Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, a photography
expert with the FBI, photographed the rifle used in the assassination,
attempting to duplicate the position of the rifle and the lighting in
Exhibit No. 133-A.<a id="FNanchor_C4-85" href="#Footnote_C4-85" class="fnanchor">C4-85</a> After comparing the rifle in the simulated
photograph with the rifle in Exhibit No. 133-A, Shaneyfelt testified,
“I found it to be the same general configuration. All appearances
were the same.” He found “one notch in the stock at this point
that appears very faintly in the photograph.” He stated, however,
that while he “found no differences” between the rifles in the
two photographs, he could not make a “positive identification to the
exclusion of all other rifles of the same general configuration.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span><a id="FNanchor_C4-86" href="#Footnote_C4-86" class="fnanchor">C4-86</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
The authenticity of these pictures has been established by expert
testimony which links the second picture, Commission Exhibit No.
133-B, to Oswald’s Imperial Reflex camera, with which Marina Oswald
testified she took the pictures.<a id="FNanchor_C4-87" href="#Footnote_C4-87" class="fnanchor">C4-87</a> The negative of that picture, Commission
Exhibit No. 133-B, was found among Oswald’s possessions.<a id="FNanchor_C4-88" href="#Footnote_C4-88" class="fnanchor">C4-88</a>
Using a recognized technique of determining whether a picture was
taken with a particular camera, Shaneyfelt compared this negative
with a negative which he made by taking a new picture with
Oswald’s camera.<a id="FNanchor_C4-89" href="#Footnote_C4-89" class="fnanchor">C4-89</a> He concluded that the negative of Exhibit No.
133-B was exposed in Oswald’s Imperial Reflex camera to the exclusion
of all other cameras.<a id="FNanchor_C4-90" href="#Footnote_C4-90" class="fnanchor">C4-90</a> He could not test Exhibit No. 133-A
in the same way because the negative was never recovered.<a id="FNanchor_C4-91" href="#Footnote_C4-91" class="fnanchor">C4-91</a> Both
pictures, however, have identical backgrounds and lighting and,
judging from the shadows, were taken at the same angle. They are
photographs of the same scene.<a id="FNanchor_C4-92" href="#Footnote_C4-92" class="fnanchor">C4-92</a> Since Exhibit No. 133-B was taken
with Oswald’s camera, it is reasonably certain that Exhibit No. 133-A
was taken by the same camera at the same time, as Marina Oswald
testified. Moreover, Shaneyfelt testified that in his opinion the photographs
were not composites of two different photographs and that
Oswald’s face had not been superimposed on another body.<a id="FNanchor_C4-93" href="#Footnote_C4-93" class="fnanchor">C4-93</a></p>

<p>One of the photographs taken by Marina Oswald was widely
published in newspapers and magazines, and in many instances the
details of these pictures differed from the original, and even from
each other, particularly as to the configuration of the rifle. The Commission
sought to determine whether these photographs were retouched
prior to publication. Shaneyfelt testified that the published
photographs appeared to be based on a copy of the original which
the publications had each retouched differently.<a id="FNanchor_C4-94" href="#Footnote_C4-94" class="fnanchor">C4-94</a> Several of the
publications furnished the Commission with the prints they had used,
or described by correspondence the retouching they had done. This
information enabled the Commission to conclude that the published
pictures were the same as the original except for retouching done by
these publications, apparently for the purpose of clarifying the lines
of the rifle and other details in the picture.<a id="FNanchor_C4-95" href="#Footnote_C4-95" class="fnanchor">C4-95</a></p>

<p>The dates surrounding the taking of this picture and the purchase of
the rifle reinforce the belief that the rifle in the photograph is the rifle
which Oswald bought from Klein’s. The rifle was shipped from
Klein’s in Chicago on March 20, 1963, at a time when the Oswalds
were living on Neely Street.<a id="FNanchor_C4-96" href="#Footnote_C4-96" class="fnanchor">C4-96</a> From an examination of one of the
photographs, the Commission determined the dates of the issues of
the Militant and the Worker which Oswald was holding in his hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
By checking the actual mailing dates of these issues and the time it
usually takes to effect delivery to Dallas, it was established that the
photographs must have been taken sometime after March 27.<a id="FNanchor_C4-97" href="#Footnote_C4-97" class="fnanchor">C4-97</a> Marina
Oswald testified that the photographs were taken on a Sunday about 2
weeks before the attempted shooting of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker
on April 10, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-98" href="#Footnote_C4-98" class="fnanchor">C4-98</a> By Sunday, March 31, 1963, 10 days prior to the
Walker attempt, Oswald had undoubtedly received the rifle shipped
from Chicago on March 20, the revolver shipped from Los Angeles on
the same date,<a id="FNanchor_C4-99" href="#Footnote_C4-99" class="fnanchor">C4-99</a> and the two newspapers which he was holding in the
picture.</p>

<h4 id="hdr66">Rifle Among Oswald’s Possessions</h4>

<p>Marina Oswald testified that the rifle found on the sixth floor of
the Depository Building was the “fateful rifle of Lee Oswald.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-100" href="#Footnote_C4-100" class="fnanchor">C4-100</a>
Moreover, it was the only rifle owned by her husband following his
return from the Soviet Union in June 1962.<a id="FNanchor_C4-101" href="#Footnote_C4-101" class="fnanchor">C4-101</a> It had been purchased
in March 1963, and taken to New Orleans where Marina Oswald saw
it in their rented apartment during the summer of 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-102" href="#Footnote_C4-102" class="fnanchor">C4-102</a> It appears
from his wife’s testimony that Oswald may have sat on the screened-in
porch at night practicing with the rifle by looking through the telescopic
sight and operating the bolt.<a id="FNanchor_C4-103" href="#Footnote_C4-103" class="fnanchor">C4-103</a> In September 1963, Oswald
loaded their possessions into a station wagon owned by Ruth Paine,
who had invited Marina Oswald and the baby to live at her home in
Irving,<a id="FNanchor_C4-104" href="#Footnote_C4-104" class="fnanchor">C4-104</a> Tex. Marina Oswald has stated that the rifle was among
these possessions,<a id="FNanchor_C4-105" href="#Footnote_C4-105" class="fnanchor">C4-105</a> although Ruth Paine testified that she was not
aware of it.<a id="FNanchor_C4-106" href="#Footnote_C4-106" class="fnanchor">C4-106</a></p>

<p>From September 24, 1963, when Marina Oswald arrived in Irving
from New Orleans, until the morning of the assassination, the rifle
was, according to the evidence, stored in a green and brown blanket
in the Paines’ garage among the Oswalds’ other possessions.<a id="FNanchor_C4-107" href="#Footnote_C4-107" class="fnanchor">C4-107</a> About
1 week after the return from New Orleans, Marina Oswald was looking
in the garage for parts to the baby’s crib and thought that the parts
might be in the blanket. When she started to open the blanket, she saw
the stock of the rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C4-108" href="#Footnote_C4-108" class="fnanchor">C4-108</a> Ruth and Michael Paine both noticed the
rolled-up blanket in the garage during the time that Marina Oswald
was living in their home.<a id="FNanchor_C4-109" href="#Footnote_C4-109" class="fnanchor">C4-109</a> On several occasions, Michael Paine
moved the blanket in the garage.<a id="FNanchor_C4-110" href="#Footnote_C4-110" class="fnanchor">C4-110</a> He thought it contained tent
poles, or possibly other camping equipment such as a folding shovel.<a id="FNanchor_C4-111" href="#Footnote_C4-111" class="fnanchor">C4-111</a>
When he appeared before the Commission, Michael Paine lifted the
blanket with the rifle wrapped inside and testified that it appeared
to be the same approximate weight and shape as the package in his
garage.<a id="FNanchor_C4-112" href="#Footnote_C4-112" class="fnanchor">C4-112</a></p>

<p>About 3 hours after the assassination, a detective and deputy sheriff
saw the blanket-roll, tied with a string, lying on the floor of the Paines’
garage. Each man testified that he thought he could detect the outline
of a rifle in the blanket, even though the blanket was empty.<a id="FNanchor_C4-113" href="#Footnote_C4-113" class="fnanchor">C4-113</a>
Paul M. Stombaugh, of the FBI Laboratory, examined the blanket
and discovered a bulge approximately 10 inches long midway in the
blanket. This bulge was apparently caused by a hard protruding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
object which had stretched the blanket’s fibers. It could have been
caused by the telescopic sight of the rifle which was approximately 11
inches long.<a id="FNanchor_C4-114" href="#Footnote_C4-114" class="fnanchor">C4-114</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 1304, <a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>.)</p>

<h4 id="hdr67">Conclusion</h4>

<p>Having reviewed the evidence that (1) Lee Harvey Oswald purchased
the rifle used in the assassination, (2) Oswald’s palmprint was
on the rifle in a position which shows that he had handled it while it was
disassembled, (3) fibers found on the rifle most probably came from the
shirt Oswald was wearing on the day of the assassination, (4) a
photograph taken in the yard of Oswald’s apartment showed him holding
this rifle, and (5) the rifle was kept among Oswald’s possessions
from the time of its purchase until the day of the assassination, the
Commission concluded that the rifle used to assassinate President Kennedy
and wound Governor Connally was owned and possessed by
Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<h3 id="hdr68">THE RIFLE IN THE BUILDING</h3>

<p>The Commission has evaluated the evidence tending to show how
Lee Harvey Oswald’s Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, serial number C2766,
was brought into the Depository Building, where it was found on
the sixth floor shortly after the assassination. In this connection the
Commission considered (1) the circumstances surrounding Oswald’s
return to Irving, Tex., on Thursday, November 21, 1963, (2) the disappearance
of the rifle from its normal place of storage, (3) Oswald’s
arrival at the Depository Building on November 22, carrying a long
and bulky brown paper package, (4) the presence of a long handmade
brown paper bag near the point from which the shots were fired,
and (5) the palmprint, fiber, and paper analyses linking Oswald and
the assassination weapon to this bag.</p>

<h4 id="hdr69">The Curtain Rod Story</h4>

<p>During October and November of 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald lived
in a roominghouse in Dallas while his wife and children lived in
Irving, at the home of Ruth Paine,<a id="FNanchor_C4-115" href="#Footnote_C4-115" class="fnanchor">C4-115</a> approximately 15 miles
from Oswald’s place of work at the Texas School Book Depository.
Oswald traveled between Dallas and Irving on weekends in a car
driven by a neighbor of the Paines, Buell Wesley Frazier, who also
worked at the Depository.<a id="FNanchor_C4-116" href="#Footnote_C4-116" class="fnanchor">C4-116</a> Oswald generally would go to Irving
on Friday afternoon and return to Dallas Monday morning. According
to the testimony of Frazier, Marina Oswald, and Ruth Paine, it
appears that Oswald never returned to Irving in midweek prior to
November 21, 1963, except on Monday, October 21, when he visited
his wife in the hospital after the birth of their second child.<a id="FNanchor_C4-117" href="#Footnote_C4-117" class="fnanchor">C4-117</a></p>

<p>During the morning of November 21, Oswald asked Frazier whether
he could ride home with him that afternoon. Frazier, surprised, asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
him why he was going to Irving on Thursday night rather than
Friday. Oswald replied, “I’m going home to get some curtain
rods * * * [to] put in an apartment.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-118" href="#Footnote_C4-118" class="fnanchor">C4-118</a> The two men left work at
4:40 p.m. and drove to Irving. There was little conversation between
them on the way home.<a id="FNanchor_C4-119" href="#Footnote_C4-119" class="fnanchor">C4-119</a> Mrs. Linnie Mae Randle, Frazier’s sister,
commented to her brother about Oswald’s unusual midweek return
to Irving. Frazier told her that Oswald had come home to get curtain
rods.<a id="FNanchor_C4-120" href="#Footnote_C4-120" class="fnanchor">C4-120</a></p>

<p>It would appear, however, that obtaining curtain rods was
not the purpose of Oswald’s trip to Irving on November 21. Mrs.
A. C. Johnson, his landlady, testified that Oswald’s room at 1026
North Beckley Avenue had curtains and curtain rods,<a id="FNanchor_C4-121" href="#Footnote_C4-121" class="fnanchor">C4-121</a> and that
Oswald had never discussed the subject with her.<a id="FNanchor_C4-122" href="#Footnote_C4-122" class="fnanchor">C4-122</a> In the Paines’
garage, along with many other objects of a household character,
there were two flat lightweight curtain rods belonging to Ruth
Paine but they were still there on Friday afternoon after Oswald’s
arrest.<a id="FNanchor_C4-123" href="#Footnote_C4-123" class="fnanchor">C4-123</a> Oswald never asked Mrs. Paine about the use of curtain
rods,<a id="FNanchor_C4-124" href="#Footnote_C4-124" class="fnanchor">C4-124</a> and Marina Oswald testified that Oswald did not say anything
about curtain rods on the day before the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C4-125" href="#Footnote_C4-125" class="fnanchor">C4-125</a> No curtain
rods were known to have been discovered in the Depository Building
after the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C4-126" href="#Footnote_C4-126" class="fnanchor">C4-126</a> In deciding whether Oswald carried a rifle
to work in a long paper bag on November 22, the Commission gave
weight to the fact that Oswald gave a false reason for returning home
on November 21, and one which provided an excuse for the carrying
of a bulky package the following morning.</p>

<h4 id="hdr70">The Missing Rifle</h4>

<p>Before dinner on November 21, Oswald played on the lawn of the
Paines’ home with his daughter June.<a id="FNanchor_C4-127" href="#Footnote_C4-127" class="fnanchor">C4-127</a> After dinner Ruth Paine and
Marina Oswald were busy cleaning house and preparing their children
for bed.<a id="FNanchor_C4-128" href="#Footnote_C4-128" class="fnanchor">C4-128</a> Between the hours of 8 and 9 p.m. they were occupied
with the children in the bedrooms located at the extreme east end of
the house.<a id="FNanchor_C4-129" href="#Footnote_C4-129" class="fnanchor">C4-129</a> On the west end of the house is the attached garage,
which can be reached from the kitchen or from the outside.<a id="FNanchor_C4-130" href="#Footnote_C4-130" class="fnanchor">C4-130</a> In the
garage were the personal belongings of the Oswald family including,
as the evidence has shown, the rifle wrapped in the old brown and
green blanket.<a id="FNanchor_C4-131" href="#Footnote_C4-131" class="fnanchor">C4-131</a></p>

<p>At approximately 9 p.m., after the children had been put to bed,
Mrs. Paine, according to her testimony before the Commission, “went
out to the garage to paint some children’s blocks, and worked in the
garage for half an hour or so. I noticed when I went out that the
light was on.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-132" href="#Footnote_C4-132" class="fnanchor">C4-132</a> Mrs. Paine was certain that she had not left the
light on in the garage after dinner.<a id="FNanchor_C4-133" href="#Footnote_C4-133" class="fnanchor">C4-133</a> According to Mrs. Paine,
Oswald had gone to bed by 9 p.m.;<a id="FNanchor_C4-134" href="#Footnote_C4-134" class="fnanchor">C4-134</a> Marina Oswald testified that it
was between 9 and 10 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C4-135" href="#Footnote_C4-135" class="fnanchor">C4-135</a> Neither Marina Oswald nor Ruth Paine
saw Oswald in the garage.<a id="FNanchor_C4-136" href="#Footnote_C4-136" class="fnanchor">C4-136</a> The period between 8 and 9 p.m.,
however, provided ample opportunity for Oswald to prepare the
rifle for his departure the next morning. Only if disassembled could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
the rifle fit into the paper bag found near the window<a id="FNanchor_C4-137" href="#Footnote_C4-137" class="fnanchor">C4-137</a> from which
the shots were fired. A firearms expert with the FBI assembled the
rifle in 6 minutes using a 10-cent coin as a tool, and he could disassemble
it more rapidly.<a id="FNanchor_C4-138" href="#Footnote_C4-138" class="fnanchor">C4-138</a> While the rifle may have already been
disassembled when Oswald arrived home on Thursday, he had ample
time that evening to disassemble the rifle and insert it into the
paper bag.</p>

<p>On the day of the assassination, Marina Oswald was watching
television when she learned of the shooting. A short time later Mrs.
Paine told her that someone had shot the President “from the building
in which Lee is working.” Marina Oswald testified that at that time
“My heart dropped. I then went to the garage to see whether the
rifle was there and I saw that the blanket was still there and I said
‘Thank God.’” She did not unroll the blanket. She saw that it was
in its usual position and it appeared to her to have something inside.<a id="FNanchor_C4-139" href="#Footnote_C4-139" class="fnanchor">C4-139</a></p>

<p>Soon afterward, at about 3 p.m., police officers arrived and searched
the house. Mrs. Paine pointed out that most of the Oswalds’ possessions
were in the garage.<a id="FNanchor_C4-140" href="#Footnote_C4-140" class="fnanchor">C4-140</a> With Ruth Paine acting as an interpreter,
Detective Rose asked Marina whether her husband had a rifle.
Mrs. Paine, who had no knowledge of the rifle, first said “No,” but
when the question was translated, Marina Oswald replied “Yes.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-141" href="#Footnote_C4-141" class="fnanchor">C4-141</a>
She pointed to the blanket which was on the floor very close to where
Ruth Paine was standing. Mrs. Paine testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As she [Marina] told me about it I stepped onto the blanket
roll. * * * And she indicated to me that she had peered into this
roll and saw a portion of what she took to be a gun she knew her
husband to have, a rifle. And I then translated this to the officers
that she knew that her husband had a gun that he had stored in
here. * * * I then stepped off of it and the officer picked it up in
the middle and it bent so. * * *<a id="FNanchor_C4-142" href="#Footnote_C4-142" class="fnanchor">C4-142</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Mrs. Paine had the actual blanket before her as she testified and
she indicated that the blanket hung limp in the officer’s hand.<a id="FNanchor_C4-143" href="#Footnote_C4-143" class="fnanchor">C4-143</a>
Marina Oswald testified that this was her first knowledge that the
rifle was not in its accustomed place.<a id="FNanchor_C4-144" href="#Footnote_C4-144" class="fnanchor">C4-144</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr71">The Long and Bulky Package</h4>

<p>On the morning of November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald left
the Paine house in Irving at approximately 7:15 a.m., while Marina
Oswald was still in bed.<a id="FNanchor_C4-145" href="#Footnote_C4-145" class="fnanchor">C4-145</a> Neither she nor Mrs. Paine saw him leave
the house.<a id="FNanchor_C4-146" href="#Footnote_C4-146" class="fnanchor">C4-146</a> About half-a-block away from the Paine house was the
residence of Mrs. Linnie Mae Randle, the sister of the man with whom
Oswald drove to work—Buell Wesley Frazier. Mrs. Randle stated
that on the morning of November 22, while her brother was eating
breakfast, she looked out the breakfast-room window and saw Oswald
cross the street and walk toward the driveway where her brother parked
his car near the carport. He carried a “heavy brown bag.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-147" href="#Footnote_C4-147" class="fnanchor">C4-147</a> Oswald
gripped the bag in his right hand near the top. “It tapered like this
as he hugged it in his hand. It was * * * more bulky toward the
bottom” than toward the top.<a id="FNanchor_C4-148" href="#Footnote_C4-148" class="fnanchor">C4-148</a> She then opened the kitchen door
and saw Oswald open the right rear door of her brother’s car and place
the package in the back of the car.<a id="FNanchor_C4-149" href="#Footnote_C4-149" class="fnanchor">C4-149</a> Mrs. Randle estimated that the
package was approximately 28 inches long and about 8 inches wide.<a id="FNanchor_C4-150" href="#Footnote_C4-150" class="fnanchor">C4-150</a>
She thought that its color was similar to that of the bag found on the
sixth floor of the School Book Depository after the assassination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span><a id="FNanchor_C4-151" href="#Footnote_C4-151" class="fnanchor">C4-151</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
Frazier met Oswald at the kitchen door and together they walked to
the car.<a id="FNanchor_C4-152" href="#Footnote_C4-152" class="fnanchor">C4-152</a> After entering the car, Frazier glanced over his shoulder
and noticed a brown paper package on the back seat. He asked,
“What’s the package, Lee?” Oswald replied, “curtain rods.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-153" href="#Footnote_C4-153" class="fnanchor">C4-153</a>
Frazier told the Commission “* * * the main reason he was going
over there that Thursday afternoon when he was to bring back
some curtain rods, so I didn’t think any more about it when he
told me that.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-154" href="#Footnote_C4-154" class="fnanchor">C4-154</a> Frazier estimated that the bag was 2 feet long
“give and take a few inches,” and about 5 or 6 inches wide.<a id="FNanchor_C4-155" href="#Footnote_C4-155" class="fnanchor">C4-155</a> As
they sat in the car, Frazier asked Oswald where his lunch was, and
Oswald replied that he was going to buy his lunch that day.<a id="FNanchor_C4-156" href="#Footnote_C4-156" class="fnanchor">C4-156</a> Frazier
testified that Oswald carried no lunch bag that day. “When he rode
with me, I say he always brought lunch except that one day on
November 22 he didn’t bring his lunch that day.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-157" href="#Footnote_C4-157" class="fnanchor">C4-157</a></p>

<p>Frazier parked the car in the company parking lot about 2 blocks
north of the Depository Building. Oswald left the car first, picked
up the brown paper bag, and proceeded toward the building ahead of
Frazier. Frazier walked behind and as they crossed the railroad
tracks he watched the switching of the cars. Frazier recalled that
one end of the package was under Oswald’s armpit and the lower
part was held with his right hand so that it was carried straight
and parallel to his body. When Oswald entered the rear door of
the Depository Building, he was about 50 feet ahead of Frazier. It
was the first time that Oswald had not walked with Frazier from
the parking lot to the building entrance.<a id="FNanchor_C4-158" href="#Footnote_C4-158" class="fnanchor">C4-158</a> When Frazier entered
the building, he did not see Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-159" href="#Footnote_C4-159" class="fnanchor">C4-159</a> One employee, Jack Dougherty,
believed that he saw Oswald coming to work, but he does not
remember that Oswald had anything in his hands as he entered the
door.<a id="FNanchor_C4-160" href="#Footnote_C4-160" class="fnanchor">C4-160</a> No other employee has been found who saw Oswald enter
that morning.<a id="FNanchor_C4-161" href="#Footnote_C4-161" class="fnanchor">C4-161</a></p>

<p>In deciding whether Oswald carried the assassination weapon in the
bag which Frazier and Mrs. Randle saw, the Commission has carefully
considered the testimony of these two witnesses with regard to the
length of the bag. Frazier and Mrs. Randle testified that the bag
which Oswald was carrying was approximately 27 or 28 inches long,<a id="FNanchor_C4-162" href="#Footnote_C4-162" class="fnanchor">C4-162</a>
whereas the wooden stock of the rifle, which is its largest component,
measured 34.8 inches.<a id="FNanchor_C4-163" href="#Footnote_C4-163" class="fnanchor">C4-163</a> The bag found on the sixth floor was 38
inches long.<a id="FNanchor_C4-164" href="#Footnote_C4-164" class="fnanchor">C4-164</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 1304, <a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>.)
When Frazier appeared before the Commission and was asked
to demonstrate how Oswald carried the package, he said, “Like
I said, I remember that I didn’t look at the package very much <span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>* * *
but when I did look at it he did have his hands on the package like
that,”<a id="FNanchor_C4-165" href="#Footnote_C4-165" class="fnanchor">C4-165</a> and at this point Frazier placed the upper part of the
package under his armpit and attempted to cup his right hand beneath
the bottom of the bag. The disassembled rifle was too long to be
carried in this manner. Similarly, when the butt of the rifle was
placed in Frazier’s hand, it extended above his shoulder to ear level.<a id="FNanchor_C4-166" href="#Footnote_C4-166" class="fnanchor">C4-166</a>
Moreover, in an interview on December 1, 1963, with agents of the
FBI, Frazier had marked the point on the back seat of his car which
he believed was where the bag reached when it was laid on the seat
with one edge against the door. The distance between the point on
the seat and the door was 27 inches.<a id="FNanchor_C4-167" href="#Footnote_C4-167" class="fnanchor">C4-167</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Randle said, when shown the paper bag, that the bag she
saw Oswald carrying “wasn’t that long, I mean it was folded down at
the top as I told you. It definitely wasn’t that long.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-168" href="#Footnote_C4-168" class="fnanchor">C4-168</a> And she
folded the bag to a length of about 28½ inches. Frazier doubted
whether the bag that Oswald carried was as wide as the bag found
on the sixth floor,<a id="FNanchor_C4-169" href="#Footnote_C4-169" class="fnanchor">C4-169</a> although Mrs. Randle testified that the width
was approximately the same.<a id="FNanchor_C4-170" href="#Footnote_C4-170" class="fnanchor">C4-170</a></p>

<p>The Commission has weighed the visual recollection of Frazier
and Mrs. Randle against the evidence here presented that the bag
Oswald carried contained the assassination weapon and has concluded
that Frazier and Randle are mistaken as to the length of the
bag. Mrs. Randle saw the bag fleetingly and her first remembrance
is that it was held in Oswald’s right hand “and it almost touched the
ground as he carried it.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-171" href="#Footnote_C4-171" class="fnanchor">C4-171</a> Frazier’s view of the bag was from the
rear. He continually advised that he was not paying close attention.<a id="FNanchor_C4-172" href="#Footnote_C4-172" class="fnanchor">C4-172</a>
For example, he said,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * I didn’t pay too much attention the way he was walking because
I was walking along there looking at the railroad cars and
watching the men on the diesel switch them cars and I didn’t pay
too much attention on how he carried the package at all.<a id="FNanchor_C4-173" href="#Footnote_C4-173" class="fnanchor">C4-173</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Frazier could easily have been mistaken when he stated that Oswald
held the bottom of the bag cupped in his hand with the upper end
tucked into his armpit.</p>

<h4 id="hdr72">Location of Bag</h4>

<p>A handmade bag of wrapping paper and tape<a id="FNanchor_C4-174" href="#Footnote_C4-174" class="fnanchor">C4-174</a> was found in
the southeast corner of the sixth floor alongside the window from
which the shots were fired.<a id="FNanchor_C4-175" href="#Footnote_C4-175" class="fnanchor">C4-175</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 2707,
<a href="#Page_142">p. 142</a>.) It was not a standard type bag which could be obtained
in a store and it was presumably made for a particular purpose.
It was the appropriate size to contain, in disassembled form, Oswald’s
Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, serial No. C2766, which was also found
on the sixth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C4-176" href="#Footnote_C4-176" class="fnanchor">C4-176</a> Three cartons had been placed at the window
apparently to act as a gun rest and a fourth carton was placed
behind those at the window.<a id="FNanchor_C4-177" href="#Footnote_C4-177" class="fnanchor">C4-177</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 1301,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
<a href="#Page_138">p. 138</a>.) A person seated on the fourth carton could assemble the rifle
without being seen from the rest of the sixth floor because the cartons
stacked around the southeast corner would shield him.<a id="FNanchor_C4-178" href="#Footnote_C4-178" class="fnanchor">C4-178</a> (See Commission
Exhibit No. 723, <a href="#Page_80">p. 80</a>.) The presence of the bag in this
corner is cogent evidence that it was used as the container for the
rifle. At the time the bag was found, Lieutenant Day of the Dallas
police wrote on it, “Found next to the sixth floor window gun fired
from. May have been used to carry gun. Lt. J. C. Day.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-179" href="#Footnote_C4-179" class="fnanchor">C4-179</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr73">Scientific Evidence Linking Rifle and Oswald to Paper Bag</h4>

<p><i>Oswald’s fingerprint and palmprint found on bag.</i>—Using a standard
chemical method involving silver nitrates<a id="FNanchor_C4-180" href="#Footnote_C4-180" class="fnanchor">C4-180</a> the FBI Laboratory
developed a latent palmprint and latent fingerprint on the bag. (See
app. X, <a href="#Page_565">p. 565</a>.) Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the FBI’s Latent
Fingerprint Section, identified these prints as the left index
fingerprint and right palmprint of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-181" href="#Footnote_C4-181" class="fnanchor">C4-181</a> The
portion of the palm which was identified was the heel of the right
palm, i.e., the area near the wrist, on the little finger side.<a id="FNanchor_C4-182" href="#Footnote_C4-182" class="fnanchor">C4-182</a> These
prints were examined independently by Ronald G. Wittmus of the
FBI,<a id="FNanchor_C4-183" href="#Footnote_C4-183" class="fnanchor">C4-183</a> and by Arthur Mandella, a fingerprint expert with the New
York City Police Department.<a id="FNanchor_C4-184" href="#Footnote_C4-184" class="fnanchor">C4-184</a> Both concluded that the prints
were the right palm and left index finger of Lee Oswald. No other
identifiable prints were found on the bag.<a id="FNanchor_C4-185" href="#Footnote_C4-185" class="fnanchor">C4-185</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s palmprint on the bottom of the paper bag indicated, of
course, that he had handled the bag. Furthermore, it was consistent
with the bag having contained a heavy or bulky object when he handled
it since a light object is usually held by the fingers.<a id="FNanchor_C4-186" href="#Footnote_C4-186" class="fnanchor">C4-186</a> The palmprint
was found on the closed end of the bag. It was from Oswald’s right
hand, in which he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier’s
car to the building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-187" href="#Footnote_C4-187" class="fnanchor">C4-187</a></p>

<p><i>Materials used to make bag.</i>—On the day of the assassination, the
Dallas police obtained a sample of wrapping paper and tape from
the shipping room of the Depository and forwarded it to the FBI
Laboratory in Washington.<a id="FNanchor_C4-188" href="#Footnote_C4-188" class="fnanchor">C4-188</a> James C. Cadigan, a questioned-documents
expert with the Bureau, compared the samples with the paper
and tape in the actual bag. He testified, “In all of the observations
and physical tests that I made I found * * * the bag * * * and the
paper sample * * * were the same.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-189" href="#Footnote_C4-189" class="fnanchor">C4-189</a></p>

<p>Among other tests, the paper and tape were submitted to fiber
analysis and spectrographic examination.<a id="FNanchor_C4-190" href="#Footnote_C4-190" class="fnanchor">C4-190</a> In addition the tape was
compared to determine whether the sample tape and the tape on the
bag had been taken from the tape dispensing machine at the Depository.
When asked to explain the similarity of characteristics,
Cadigan stated:<a id="FNanchor_C4-191" href="#Footnote_C4-191" class="fnanchor">C4-191</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, briefly, it would be the thickness of both the paper and
the tape, the color under various lighting conditions of both the
paper and the tape, the width of the tape, the knurled markings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
on the surface of the fiber, the texture of the fiber, the felting
pattern * * *</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I found that the paper sack found on the sixth floor * * * and
the sample * * * had the same observable characteristics
both under the microscope and all the visual tests that I could
conduct.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The papers I also found were similar in fiber composition,
therefore, in addition to the visual characteristics, microscopic
and UV [ultra violet] characteristics.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Mr. Cadigan concluded that the paper and tape from the bag were
identical in all respects to the sample paper and tape taken from the
Texas School Book Depository shipping room on November 22, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-192" href="#Footnote_C4-192" class="fnanchor">C4-192</a></p>

<p>On December 1, 1963, a replica bag was made from materials found
on that date in the shipping room. This was done as an investigatory
aid since the original bag had been discolored during various
laboratory examinations and could not be used for valid identification
by witnesses.<a id="FNanchor_C4-193" href="#Footnote_C4-193" class="fnanchor">C4-193</a> Cadigan found that the paper used to make this
replica sack had different characteristics from the paper in the original
bag.<a id="FNanchor_C4-194" href="#Footnote_C4-194" class="fnanchor">C4-194</a> The science of paper analysis enabled him to distinguish
between different rolls of paper even though they were produced by
the same manufacturer.<a id="FNanchor_C4-195" href="#Footnote_C4-195" class="fnanchor">C4-195</a></p>

<p>Since the Depository normally used approximately one roll of paper
every 3 working days,<a id="FNanchor_C4-196" href="#Footnote_C4-196" class="fnanchor">C4-196</a> it was not surprising that the replica sack
made on December 1, 1963, had different characteristics from both
the actual bag and the sample taken on November 22. On the other
hand, since two rolls could be made from the same batch of paper,
one cannot estimate when, prior to November 22, Oswald made the
paper bag. However, the complete identity of characteristics between
the paper and tape in the bag found on the sixth floor and the paper
and tape found in the shipping room of the Depository on November
22 enabled the Commission to conclude that the bag was made
from these materials. The Depository shipping department was on
the first floor to which Oswald had access in the normal performance
of his duties filling orders.<a id="FNanchor_C4-197" href="#Footnote_C4-197" class="fnanchor">C4-197</a></p>

<p><i>Fibers in paper bag matched fibers in blanket.</i>—When Paul M.
Stombaugh of the FBI Laboratory examined the paper bag, he found,
on the inside, a single brown delustered viscose fiber and several light
green cotton fibers.<a id="FNanchor_C4-198" href="#Footnote_C4-198" class="fnanchor">C4-198</a> The blanket in which the rifle was stored was
composed of brown and green cotton, viscose and woolen fibers.<a id="FNanchor_C4-199" href="#Footnote_C4-199" class="fnanchor">C4-199</a></p>

<p>The single brown viscose fiber found in the bag matched some
of the brown viscose fibers from the blanket in all observable characteristics.<a id="FNanchor_C4-200" href="#Footnote_C4-200" class="fnanchor">C4-200</a>
The green cotton fibers found in the paper bag matched
some of the green cotton fibers in the blanket “in all observable microscopic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
characteristics.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-201" href="#Footnote_C4-201" class="fnanchor">C4-201</a> Despite these matches, however, Stombaugh
was unable to render an opinion that the fibers which he found
in the bag had probably come from the blanket, because other types
of fibers present in the blanket were not found in the bag. He
concluded:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All I would say here is that it is possible that these fibers could
have come from this blanket, because this blanket is composed
of brown and green woolen fibers, brown and green delustered
viscose fibers, and brown and green cotton fibers. * * * We found
no brown cotton fibers, no green viscose fibers, and no woolen
fibers.</p>

<p>So if I found all of these then I would have been able to say
these fibers probably had come from this blanket. But since I
found so few, then I would say the possibility exists, these fibers
could have come from this blanket.<a id="FNanchor_C4-202" href="#Footnote_C4-202" class="fnanchor">C4-202</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Stombaugh confirmed that the rifle could have picked up fibers
from the blanket and transferred them to the paper bag.<a id="FNanchor_C4-203" href="#Footnote_C4-203" class="fnanchor">C4-203</a> In light
of the other evidence linking Lee Harvey Oswald, the blanket, and
the rifle to the paper bag found on the sixth floor, the Commission
considered Stombaugh’s testimony of probative value in deciding
whether Oswald carried the rifle into the building in the paper bag.</p>

<h4 id="hdr74">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that
Lee Harvey Oswald (1) told the curtain rod story to Frazier to explain
both the return to Irving on a Thursday and the obvious bulk
of the package which he intended to bring to work the next day; (2)
took paper and tape from the wrapping bench of the Depository and
fashioned a bag large enough to carry the disassembled rifle; (3)
removed the rifle from the blanket in the Paines’ garage on Thursday
evening; (4) carried the rifle into the Depository Building, concealed
in the bag; and, (5) left the bag alongside the window from which
the shots were fired.</p>

<h3 id="hdr75">OSWALD AT WINDOW</h3>

<p>Lee Harvey Oswald was hired on October 15, 1963, by the Texas
School Book Depository as an “order filler.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-204" href="#Footnote_C4-204" class="fnanchor">C4-204</a> He worked principally
on the first and sixth floors of the building, gathering books listed on orders
and delivering them to the shipping room on the first floor.<a id="FNanchor_C4-205" href="#Footnote_C4-205" class="fnanchor">C4-205</a> He
had ready access to the sixth floor,<a id="FNanchor_C4-206" href="#Footnote_C4-206" class="fnanchor">C4-206</a> from the southeast corner window
of which the shots were fired.<a id="FNanchor_C4-207" href="#Footnote_C4-207" class="fnanchor">C4-207</a> The Commission evaluated the
physical evidence found near the window after the assassination and
the testimony of eyewitnesses in deciding whether Lee Harvey Oswald

<h4 id="hdr76">Palmprints and Fingerprints on Cartons and Paper Bag</h4>

<p>Below the southeast corner window on the sixth floor was a large
carton of books measuring approximately 18 by 12 by 14 inches which
had been moved from a stack along the south wall.<a id="FNanchor_C4-208" href="#Footnote_C4-208" class="fnanchor">C4-208</a> Atop this carton
was a small carton marked “Rolling Readers,” measuring approximately
13 by 9 by 8 inches.<a id="FNanchor_C4-209" href="#Footnote_C4-209" class="fnanchor">C4-209</a> In front of this small carton and resting
partially on the windowsill was another small “Rolling Readers” carton.<a id="FNanchor_C4-210" href="#Footnote_C4-210" class="fnanchor">C4-210</a>
These two small cartons had been moved from a stack about
three aisles away.<a id="FNanchor_C4-211" href="#Footnote_C4-211" class="fnanchor">C4-211</a> The boxes in the window appeared to have been
arranged as a convenient gun rest.<a id="FNanchor_C4-212" href="#Footnote_C4-212" class="fnanchor">C4-212</a> (See Commission Exhibit No.
1301, <a href="#Page_138">p. 138</a>.) Behind these boxes was another carton placed on
the floor on which a man sitting could look southwesterly down Elm
Street over the top of the “Rolling Readers” cartons.<a id="FNanchor_C4-213" href="#Footnote_C4-213" class="fnanchor">C4-213</a> Next to these
cartons was the handmade paper bag, previously discussed, on which
appeared the print of the left index finger and right palm of Lee
Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-214" href="#Footnote_C4-214" class="fnanchor">C4-214</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 1302, <a href="#Page_139">p. 139</a>.)</p>

<p>The cartons were forwarded to the FBI in Washington. Sebastian
F. Latona, supervisor of the Latent Fingerprint Section,
testified that 20 identifiable fingerprints and 8 palmprints were developed
on these cartons.<a id="FNanchor_C4-215" href="#Footnote_C4-215" class="fnanchor">C4-215</a> The carton on the windowsill and the
large carton below the window contained no prints which could be
identified as being those of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-216" href="#Footnote_C4-216" class="fnanchor">C4-216</a> The other “Rolling
Readers” carton, however, contained a palmprint and a fingerprint
which were identified by Latona as being the left palmprint and right
index fingerprint of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-217" href="#Footnote_C4-217" class="fnanchor">C4-217</a> (See app. X, <a href="#Page_566">p. 566</a>.)</p>

<p>The Commission has considered the possibility that the cartons
might have been moved in connection with the work that was being
performed on the sixth floor on November 22. Depository employees
were laying a new floor at the west end and transferring books from
the west to the east end of the building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-218" href="#Footnote_C4-218" class="fnanchor">C4-218</a> The “Rolling Readers”
cartons, however, had not been moved by the floor layers and had apparently
been taken to the window from their regular position for
some particular purpose.<a id="FNanchor_C4-219" href="#Footnote_C4-219" class="fnanchor">C4-219</a> The “Rolling Readers” boxes contained,
instead of books, light blocks used as reading aids.<a id="FNanchor_C4-220" href="#Footnote_C4-220" class="fnanchor">C4-220</a> They could be
easily adjusted and were still solid enough to serve as a gun rest.</p>

<p>The box on the floor, behind the three near the window, had been one
of these moved by the floor layers from the west wall to near the east
side of the building in preparation for the laying of the floor.<a id="FNanchor_C4-221" href="#Footnote_C4-221" class="fnanchor">C4-221</a> During
the afternoon of November 22, Lieutenant Day of the Dallas police
dusted this carton with powder and developed a palmprint on the top
edge of the carton on the side nearest the window.<a id="FNanchor_C4-222" href="#Footnote_C4-222" class="fnanchor">C4-222</a> The position of
this palmprint on the carton was parallel with the long axis of the box,
and at right angles with the short axis; the bottom of the palm rested
on the box.<a id="FNanchor_C4-223" href="#Footnote_C4-223" class="fnanchor">C4-223</a> Someone sitting on the box facing the window would
have his palm in this position if he placed his hand alongside his
right hip. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1302, <a href="#Page_139">p. 139</a>.) This print<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
which had been cut out of the box was also forwarded to the FBI and
Latona identified it as Oswald’s right palmprint.<a id="FNanchor_C4-224" href="#Footnote_C4-224" class="fnanchor">C4-224</a> In Latona’s opinion
“not too long” a time had elapsed between the time that the print
was placed on the carton and the time that it had been developed by
the Dallas police.<a id="FNanchor_C4-225" href="#Footnote_C4-225" class="fnanchor">C4-225</a> Although Bureau experiments had shown that
24 hours was a likely maximum time, Latona stated that he could only
testify with certainty that the print was less than 3 days old.<a id="FNanchor_C4-226" href="#Footnote_C4-226" class="fnanchor">C4-226</a></p>

<p>The print, therefore, could have been placed on the carton at any
time within this period. The freshness of this print could be estimated
only because the Dallas police developed it through the use of
powder. Since cartons absorb perspiration, powder can successfully
develop a print on such material<a id="FNanchor_C4-227" href="#Footnote_C4-227" class="fnanchor">C4-227</a> only within a limited time.
When the FBI in Washington received the cartons, the remaining
prints, including Oswald’s on the Rolling Readers carton, were developed
by chemical processes. The freshness of prints developed in
this manner<a id="FNanchor_C4-228" href="#Footnote_C4-228" class="fnanchor">C4-228</a> cannot be estimated, so no conclusions can be drawn
as to whether these remaining prints preceded or followed the print
developed in Dallas by powder. Most of the prints were found to
have been placed on the cartons by an FBI clerk and a Dallas police
officer after the cartons had been processed with powder by the Dallas
Police.<a id="FNanchor_C4-229" href="#Footnote_C4-229" class="fnanchor">C4-229</a> (See ch. VI, <a href="#Page_249">p. 249</a>; app. X, <a href="#Page_566">p. 566</a>.)</p>

<p>In his independent investigation, Arthur Mandella of the New York
City Police Department reached the same conclusion as Latona that the
prints found on the cartons were those of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a href="#Footnote_C4-229" class="fnanchor">C4-229</a> In
addition, Mandella was of the opinion that the print taken from the
carton on the floor was probably made within a day or a day and a half
of the examination on November 22.<a id="FNanchor_C4-230" href="#Footnote_C4-230" class="fnanchor">C4-230</a> Moreover, another expert with
the FBI, Ronald G. Wittmus, conducted a separate examination and
also agreed with Latona that the prints were Oswald’s.<a id="FNanchor_C4-231" href="#Footnote_C4-231" class="fnanchor">C4-231</a></p>

<p>In evaluating the significance of these fingerprint and palmprint
identifications, the Commission considered the possibility that Oswald
handled these cartons as part of his normal duties. Since other
identifiable prints were developed on the cartons, the Commission
requested that they be compared with the prints of the 12 warehouse
employees who, like Oswald, might have handled the cartons. They
were also compared with the prints of those law enforcement officials
who might have handled the cartons. The results of this investigation
are fully discussed in chapter VI, page 249. Although a person could
handle a carton and not leave identifiable prints, none of these employees
except Oswald left identifiable prints on the cartons.<a id="FNanchor_C4-232" href="#Footnote_C4-232" class="fnanchor">C4-232</a> This
finding, in addition to the freshness of one of the prints and the presence
of Oswald’s prints on two of the four cartons and the paper bag
led the Commission to attach some probative value to the fingerprint
and palmprint identifications in reaching the conclusion that Oswald
was at the window from which the shots were fired, although the
prints do not establish the exact time he was there.</p>

<h4 id="hdr77">Oswald’s Presence on Sixth Floor Approximately 35 Minutes Before
the Assassination</h4>

<p>Additional testimony linking Oswald with the point from which
the shots were fired was provided by the testimony of Charles Givens,
who was the last known employee to see Oswald inside the building
prior to the assassination. During the morning of November 22,
Givens was working with the floor-laying crew in the southwest
section of the sixth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C4-233" href="#Footnote_C4-233" class="fnanchor">C4-233</a> At about 11:45 a.m. the floor-laying
crew used both elevators to come down from the sixth floor. The employees
raced the elevators to the first floor.<a id="FNanchor_C4-234" href="#Footnote_C4-234" class="fnanchor">C4-234</a> Givens saw Oswald
standing at the gate on the fifth floor as the elevator went by.<a id="FNanchor_C4-235" href="#Footnote_C4-235" class="fnanchor">C4-235</a>
Givens testified that after reaching the first floor, “I discovered I left
my cigarettes in my jacket pocket upstairs, and I took the elevator
back upstairs to get my jacket with my cigarettes in it.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-236" href="#Footnote_C4-236" class="fnanchor">C4-236</a> He saw
Oswald, a clipboard in hand, walking from the southeast corner of
the sixth floor toward the elevator.<a id="FNanchor_C4-237" href="#Footnote_C4-237" class="fnanchor">C4-237</a> (See Commission Exhibit No.
2707, <a href="#Page_142">p. 142</a>.) Givens said to Oswald, “Boy are you going downstairs? * * * It’s near lunch time.” Oswald said, “No, sir. When
you get downstairs, close the gate to the elevator.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-238" href="#Footnote_C4-238" class="fnanchor">C4-238</a> Oswald was
referring to the west elevator which operates by pushbutton and only
with the gate closed.<a id="FNanchor_C4-239" href="#Footnote_C4-239" class="fnanchor">C4-239</a> Givens said, “Okay,” and rode down in the
east elevator. When he reached the first floor, the west elevator—the
one with the gate—was not there. Givens thought this was about
11:55 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_C4-240" href="#Footnote_C4-240" class="fnanchor">C4-240</a> None of the Depository employees is known to have seen
Oswald again until after the shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C4-241" href="#Footnote_C4-241" class="fnanchor">C4-241</a></p>

<p>The significance of Givens’ observation that Oswald was carrying
his clipboard became apparent on December 2, 1963, when an employee,
Frankie Kaiser, found a clipboard hidden by book cartons
in the northwest corner of the sixth floor at the west wall a few feet
from where the rifle had been found.<a id="FNanchor_C4-242" href="#Footnote_C4-242" class="fnanchor">C4-242</a> This clipboard had been
made by Kaiser and had his name on it.<a id="FNanchor_C4-243" href="#Footnote_C4-243" class="fnanchor">C4-243</a> Kaiser identified it as
the clipboard which Oswald had appropriated from him when
Oswald came to work at the Depository.<a id="FNanchor_C4-244" href="#Footnote_C4-244" class="fnanchor">C4-244</a> Three invoices on this
clipboard, each dated November 22, were for Scott-Foresman books,
located on the first and sixth floors.<a id="FNanchor_C4-245" href="#Footnote_C4-245" class="fnanchor">C4-245</a> Oswald had not filled any of
the three orders.<a id="FNanchor_C4-246" href="#Footnote_C4-246" class="fnanchor">C4-246</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr78">Eyewitness Identification of Assassin</h4>

<p>Howard L. Brennan was an eyewitness to the shooting. As indicated
previously the Commission considered his testimony as probative
in reaching the conclusion that the shots came from the sixth
floor, southeast corner window of the Depository Building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-247" href="#Footnote_C4-247" class="fnanchor">C4-247</a> (See
ch. III, <a href="#Page_61">pp. 61-68</a>.) Brennan also testified that Lee Harvey Oswald,
whom he viewed in a police lineup on the night of the assassination,
was the man he saw fire the shots from the sixth-floor window of the
Depository Building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-248" href="#Footnote_C4-248" class="fnanchor">C4-248</a> When the shots were fired, Brennan was in
an excellent position to observe anyone in the window. He was sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
on a concrete wall on the southwest corner of Elm and Houston Streets,
looking north at the Depository Building which was directly in front
of him.<a id="FNanchor_C4-249" href="#Footnote_C4-249" class="fnanchor">C4-249</a> The window was approximately 120 feet away.<a id="FNanchor_C4-250" href="#Footnote_C4-250" class="fnanchor">C4-250</a>(See
Commission Exhibit No. 477, <a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>.)</p>

<p>In the 6- to 8-minute period before the motorcade arrived,<a id="FNanchor_C4-251" href="#Footnote_C4-251" class="fnanchor">C4-251</a> Brennan
saw a man leave and return to the window “a couple of times.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-252" href="#Footnote_C4-252" class="fnanchor">C4-252</a>
After hearing the first shot, which he thought was a motorcycle backfire,
Brennan glanced up at the window. He testified that “this man
I saw previously was aiming for his last shot * * * as it appeared to
me he was standing up and resting against the left window sill * * *.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-253" href="#Footnote_C4-253" class="fnanchor">C4-253</a></p>

<p>Brennan saw the man fire the last shot and disappear from the window.
Within minutes of the assassination, Brennan described the man
to the police.<a id="FNanchor_C4-254" href="#Footnote_C4-254" class="fnanchor">C4-254</a> This description most probably led to the radio
alert sent to police cars at approximately 12:45 p.m., which described
the suspect as white, slender, weighing about 165 pounds, about 5’10”
tall, and in his early thirties.<a id="FNanchor_C4-255" href="#Footnote_C4-255" class="fnanchor">C4-255</a> In his sworn statement to the police
later that day, Brennan described the man in similar terms, except
that he gave the weight as between 165 and 175 pounds and the height
was omitted.<a id="FNanchor_C4-256" href="#Footnote_C4-256" class="fnanchor">C4-256</a> In his testimony before the Commission, Brennan
described the person he saw as “* * * a man in his early thirties,
fair complexion, slender, but neat, neat slender, possible 5 foot 10 * * *
160 to 170 pounds.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-257" href="#Footnote_C4-257" class="fnanchor">C4-257</a> Oswald was 5’9”, slender and 24 years old.
When arrested, he gave his weight as 140 pounds.<a id="FNanchor_C4-258" href="#Footnote_C4-258" class="fnanchor">C4-258</a> On other occasions
he gave weights of both 140 and 150 pounds.<a id="FNanchor_C4-259" href="#Footnote_C4-259" class="fnanchor">C4-259</a> The New Orleans
police records of his arrest in August of 1963 show a weight of
136 pounds.<a id="FNanchor_C4-260" href="#Footnote_C4-260" class="fnanchor">C4-260</a> The autopsy report indicated an estimated weight
of 150 pounds.<a id="FNanchor_C4-261" href="#Footnote_C4-261" class="fnanchor">C4-261</a></p>

<p>Brennan’s description should also be compared with the eyewitness
description broadcast over the Dallas police radio at 1:22 p.m. of
the man who shot Patrolman J. D. Tippit. The suspect was described
as “a white male about 30, 5’8”, black hair, slender. * * *”<a id="FNanchor_C4-262" href="#Footnote_C4-262" class="fnanchor">C4-262</a> At 1:29
p.m. the police radio reported that the description of the suspect in
the Tippit shooting was similar to the description which had been
given by Brennan in connection with the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C4-263" href="#Footnote_C4-263" class="fnanchor">C4-263</a> Approximately
7 or 8 minutes later the police radio reported that “an eyeball
witness” described the suspect in the Tippit shooting as “a white
male, 27, 5’11”, 165 pounds, black wavy hair.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-264" href="#Footnote_C4-264" class="fnanchor">C4-264</a> As will be discussed
fully below, the Commission has concluded that this suspect was Lee
Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Although Brennan testified that the man in the window was standing
when he fired the shots,<a id="FNanchor_C4-265" href="#Footnote_C4-265" class="fnanchor">C4-265</a> most probably he was either sitting or
kneeling. The half-open window,<a id="FNanchor_C4-266" href="#Footnote_C4-266" class="fnanchor">C4-266</a> the arrangement of the boxes,<a id="FNanchor_C4-267" href="#Footnote_C4-267" class="fnanchor">C4-267</a>
and the angle of the shots virtually preclude a standing position.<a id="FNanchor_C4-268" href="#Footnote_C4-268" class="fnanchor">C4-268</a>
It is understandable, however, for Brennan to have believed that the
man with the rifle was standing. A photograph of the building taken
seconds after the assassination shows three employees looking out of
the fifth-floor window directly below the window from which the
shots were fired. Brennan testified that they were standing,<a id="FNanchor_C4-269" href="#Footnote_C4-269" class="fnanchor">C4-269</a> which
is their apparent position in the photograph.<a id="FNanchor_C4-270" href="#Footnote_C4-270" class="fnanchor">C4-270</a> (See Dillard Exhibits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
Nos. C and D. <a href="#Page_66">pp. 66-67</a>.) But the testimony of these employees,<a id="FNanchor_C4-271" href="#Footnote_C4-271" class="fnanchor">C4-271</a>
together with photographs subsequently taken of them at
the scene of the assassination,<a id="FNanchor_C4-272" href="#Footnote_C4-272" class="fnanchor">C4-272</a> establishes that they were either squatting
or kneeling. (See Commission Exhibit No. 485, <a href="#Page_69">p. 69</a>.) Since
the window ledges in the Depository Building are lower than in most
buildings,<a id="FNanchor_C4-273" href="#Footnote_C4-273" class="fnanchor">C4-273</a> a person squatting or kneeling exposes more of his body
than would normally be the case. From the street, this creates the
impression that the person is standing. Brennan could have seen
enough of the body of a kneeling or squatting person to estimate his
height.</p>

<p>Shortly after the assassination Brennan noticed two of these employees
leaving the building and immediately identified them as having
been in the fifth-floor windows.<a id="FNanchor_C4-274" href="#Footnote_C4-274" class="fnanchor">C4-274</a> When the three employees appeared
before the Commission, Brennan identified the two whom he
saw leave the building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-275" href="#Footnote_C4-275" class="fnanchor">C4-275</a> The two men, Harold Norman and James
Jarman, Jr., each confirmed that when they came out of the building,
they saw and heard Brennan describing what he had seen.<a id="FNanchor_C4-276" href="#Footnote_C4-276" class="fnanchor">C4-276</a> Norman
stated, “* * * I remember him talking and I believe I remember
seeing him saying that he saw us when we first went up to the fifth-floor
window, he saw us then.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-277" href="#Footnote_C4-277" class="fnanchor">C4-277</a> Jarman heard Brennan “talking
to this officer about that he had heard these shots and he had seen
the barrel of the gun sticking out the window, and he said that the
shots came from inside the building.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-278" href="#Footnote_C4-278" class="fnanchor">C4-278</a></p>

<p>During the evening of November 22, Brennan identified Oswald
as the person in the lineup who bore the closest resemblance to the man
in the window but he said he was unable to make a positive identification.<a id="FNanchor_C4-279" href="#Footnote_C4-279" class="fnanchor">C4-279</a>
Prior to the lineup, Brennan had seen Oswald’s picture on
television and he told the Commission that whether this affected his
identification “is something I do not know.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-280" href="#Footnote_C4-280" class="fnanchor">C4-280</a> In an interview with
FBI agents on December 17, 1963, Brennan stated that he was sure
that the person firing the rifle was Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-281" href="#Footnote_C4-281" class="fnanchor">C4-281</a> In another interview
with FBI agents on January 7, 1964, Brennan appeared to revert to
his earlier inability to make a positive identification,<a id="FNanchor_C4-282" href="#Footnote_C4-282" class="fnanchor">C4-282</a> but, in his testimony
before the Commission, Brennan stated that his remarks of
January 7 were intended by him merely as an accurate report of what
he said on November 22.<a id="FNanchor_C4-283" href="#Footnote_C4-283" class="fnanchor">C4-283</a></p>

<p>Brennan told the Commission that he could have made a positive
identification in the lineup on November 22 but did not do so because he
felt that the assassination was “a Communist activity, and I felt like
there hadn’t been more than one eyewitness, and if it got to be a known
fact that I was an eyewitness, my family or I, either one, might not be
safe.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-284" href="#Footnote_C4-284" class="fnanchor">C4-284</a> When specifically asked before the Commission whether or
not he could positively identify the man he saw in the sixth-floor
window as the same man he saw in the police station, Brennan stated,
“I could at that time—I could, with all sincerity, identify him as
being the same man.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-285" href="#Footnote_C4-285" class="fnanchor">C4-285</a></p>

<p>Although the record indicates that Brennan was an accurate observer,
he declined to make a positive identification of Oswald when
he first saw him in the police lineup.<a id="FNanchor_C4-286" href="#Footnote_C4-286" class="fnanchor">C4-286</a> The Commission, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
does not base its conclusion concerning the identity of the assassin on
Brennan’s subsequent certain identification of Lee Harvey Oswald
as the man he saw fire the rifle. Immediately after the assassination,
however, Brennan described to the police the man he saw in the
window and then identified Oswald as the person who most nearly
resembled the man he saw. The Commission is satisfied that, at the
least, Brennan saw a man in the window who closely resembled Lee
Harvey Oswald, and that Brennan believes the man he saw was in
fact Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Two other witnesses were able to offer partial descriptions of a man
they saw in the southeast corner window of the sixth floor approximately
1 minute before the assassination, although neither witness saw
the shots being fired.<a id="FNanchor_C4-287" href="#Footnote_C4-287" class="fnanchor">C4-287</a> Ronald Fischer and Robert Edwards were
standing on the curb at the southwest corner of Elm and Houston
Streets,<a id="FNanchor_C4-288" href="#Footnote_C4-288" class="fnanchor">C4-288</a> the same corner where Brennan was sitting on a concrete
wall.<a id="FNanchor_C4-289" href="#Footnote_C4-289" class="fnanchor">C4-289</a> Fischer testified that about 10 or 15 seconds before the motorcade
turned onto Houston Street from Main Street, Edwards said,
“Look at that guy there in that window.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-290" href="#Footnote_C4-290" class="fnanchor">C4-290</a></p>

<p>Fischer looked up and watched the man in the window for 10 or
15 seconds and then started watching the motorcade, which came into
view on Houston Street.<a id="FNanchor_C4-291" href="#Footnote_C4-291" class="fnanchor">C4-291</a> He said that the man held his attention
until the motorcade came because the man:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * appeared uncomfortable for one, and secondly, he wasn’t
watching * * * he didn’t look like he was watching for the
parade. He looked like he was looking down toward the Trinity
River and the Triple Underpass down at the end—toward the
end of Elm Street. And * * * all the time I watched him, he
never moved his head, he never—he never moved anything. Just
was there transfixed.<a id="FNanchor_C4-292" href="#Footnote_C4-292" class="fnanchor">C4-292</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Fischer placed the man in the easternmost window on the south
side of the Depository Building on either the fifth or the sixth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C4-293" href="#Footnote_C4-293" class="fnanchor">C4-293</a>
He said that he could see the man from the middle of his chest to the
top of his head, and that as he was facing the window the man was in
the lower right-hand portion of the window and “seemed to be sitting
a little forward.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-294" href="#Footnote_C4-294" class="fnanchor">C4-294</a> The man was dressed in a light-colored, open-neck
shirt which could have been either a sports shirt or a T-shirt, and
he had brown hair, a slender face and neck with light complexion, and
looked to be 22 or 24 years old.<a id="FNanchor_C4-295" href="#Footnote_C4-295" class="fnanchor">C4-295</a> The person in the window was a
white man and “looked to me like he was looking straight at the Triple
Underpass” down Elm Street.<a id="FNanchor_C4-296" href="#Footnote_C4-296" class="fnanchor">C4-296</a> Boxes and cases were stacked behind
him.<a id="FNanchor_C4-297" href="#Footnote_C4-297" class="fnanchor">C4-297</a></p>

<p>Approximately 1 week after the assassination, according to Fischer,
policemen showed him a picture of Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-298" href="#Footnote_C4-298" class="fnanchor">C4-298</a> In his testimony he
said, “I told them that that could have been the man. * * * That
that could have been the man that I saw in the window in the School
Book Depository Building, but that I was not sure.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-299" href="#Footnote_C4-299" class="fnanchor">C4-299</a> Fischer
described the man’s hair as some shade of brown—“it wasn’t dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
and it wasn’t light.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-300" href="#Footnote_C4-300" class="fnanchor">C4-300</a> On November 22, Fischer had apparently
described the man as “light-headed.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-301" href="#Footnote_C4-301" class="fnanchor">C4-301</a> Fischer explained that he did
not mean by the earlier statement that the man was blond, but rather
that his hair was not black.<a id="FNanchor_C4-302" href="#Footnote_C4-302" class="fnanchor">C4-302</a></p>

<p>Robert Edwards said that, while looking at the south side of the
Depository Building shortly before the motorcade, he saw nothing of
importance “except maybe one individual who was up there in the
corner room of the sixth floor which was crowded in among boxes.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-303" href="#Footnote_C4-303" class="fnanchor">C4-303</a>
He said that this was a white man about average in size, “possibly
thin,” and that he thought the man had light-brown hair.<a id="FNanchor_C4-304" href="#Footnote_C4-304" class="fnanchor">C4-304</a> Fischer
and Edwards did not see the man clearly enough or long enough to
identify him. Their testimony is of probative value, however, because
their limited description is consistent with that of the man who has
been found by the Commission, based on other evidence, to have fired
the shots from the window.</p>

<p>Another person who saw the assassin as the shots were fired was
Amos L. Euins, age 15, who was one of the first witnesses to alert the
police to the Depository as the source of the shots, as has been discussed
in chapter III.<a id="FNanchor_C4-305" href="#Footnote_C4-305" class="fnanchor">C4-305</a> Euins, who was on the southwest corner of
Elm and Houston Streets,<a id="FNanchor_C4-306" href="#Footnote_C4-306" class="fnanchor">C4-306</a> testified that he could not describe the man
he saw in the window. According to Euins, however, as the man lowered
his head in order to aim the rifle down Elm Street, he appeared
to have a white bald spot on his head.<a id="FNanchor_C4-307" href="#Footnote_C4-307" class="fnanchor">C4-307</a> Shortly after the assassination,
Euins signed an affidavit describing the man as “white,”<a id="FNanchor_C4-308" href="#Footnote_C4-308" class="fnanchor">C4-308</a> but
a radio reporter testified that Euins described the man to him as
“colored.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-309" href="#Footnote_C4-309" class="fnanchor">C4-309</a> In his Commission testimony, Euins stated that he
could not ascertain the man’s race and that the statement in the affidavit
was intended to refer only to the white spot on the man’s head
and not to his race.<a id="FNanchor_C4-310" href="#Footnote_C4-310" class="fnanchor">C4-310</a> A Secret Service agent who spoke to Euins
approximately 20 to 30 minutes after the assassination confirmed that
Euins could neither describe the man in the window nor indicate his
race.<a id="FNanchor_C4-311" href="#Footnote_C4-311" class="fnanchor">C4-311</a> Accordingly, Euins’ testimony is considered probative as to
the source of the shots but is inconclusive as to the identity of the
man in the window.</p>

<p>In evaluating the evidence that Oswald was at the southeast corner
window of the sixth floor at the time of the shooting, the Commission
has considered the allegation that Oswald was photographed standing
in front of the building when the shots were fired. The picture
which gave rise to these allegations was taken by Associated Press
Photographer James W. Altgens, who was standing on the south side
of Elm Street between the Triple Underpass and the Depository
Building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-312" href="#Footnote_C4-312" class="fnanchor">C4-312</a> As the motorcade started its descent down Elm Street,
Altgens snapped a picture of the Presidential limousine with the
entrance to the Depository Building in the background.<a id="FNanchor_C4-313" href="#Footnote_C4-313" class="fnanchor">C4-313</a> Just before
snapping the picture Altgens heard a noise which sounded like the
popping of a firecracker. Investigation has established that Altgens’
picture was taken approximately 2 seconds after the firing of the shot
which entered the back of the President’s neck.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span><a id="FNanchor_C4-314" href="#Footnote_C4-314" class="fnanchor">C4-314</a></p>

In the background of this picture were several employees watching
the parade from the steps of the Depository Building. One of these
employees was alleged to resemble Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-315" href="#Footnote_C4-315" class="fnanchor">C4-315</a> The Commission
has determined that the employee was in fact Billy Nolan
Lovelady, who identified himself in the picture.<a id="FNanchor_C4-316" href="#Footnote_C4-316" class="fnanchor">C4-316</a> Standing alongside
him were Buell Wesley Frazier<a id="FNanchor_C4-317" href="#Footnote_C4-317" class="fnanchor">C4-317</a> and William Shelley,<a id="FNanchor_C4-318" href="#Footnote_C4-318" class="fnanchor">C4-318</a> who
also identified Lovelady. The Commission is satisfied that Oswald
does not appear in this photograph. (See Commission Exhibit No.
900, <a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>.)</p>

<h4 id="hdr79">Oswald’s Actions in Building After Assassination</h4>

<p>In considering whether Oswald was at the southeast corner window
at the time the shots were fired, the Commission has reviewed the testimony
of witnesses who saw Oswald in the building within minutes
after the assassination. The Commission has found that Oswald’s
movements, as described by these witnesses, are consistent with his
having been at the window at 12:30 p.m.</p>

<p><i>The encounter in the lunchroom.</i>—The first person to see Oswald
after the assassination was Patrolman M. L. Baker of the Dallas
Police Department. Baker was riding a two-wheeled motorcycle
behind the last press car of the motorcade.<a id="FNanchor_C4-319" href="#Footnote_C4-319" class="fnanchor">C4-319</a> As he turned the corner
from Main onto Houston at a speed of about 5 to 10 miles per hour,<a id="FNanchor_C4-320" href="#Footnote_C4-320" class="fnanchor">C4-320</a>
a strong wind blowing from the north almost unseated him.<a id="FNanchor_C4-321" href="#Footnote_C4-321" class="fnanchor">C4-321</a> At
about this time he heard the first shot.<a id="FNanchor_C4-322" href="#Footnote_C4-322" class="fnanchor">C4-322</a> Having recently heard the
sounds of rifles while on a hunting trip, Baker recognized the shots as
that of a high-powered rifle; “it sounded high and I immediately kind
of looked up, and I had a feeling that it came from the building, either
right in front of me [the Depository Building] or of the one across to
the right of it.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-323" href="#Footnote_C4-323" class="fnanchor">C4-323</a> He saw pigeons flutter upward. He was not certain,
“but I am pretty sure they came from the building right on the
northwest corner.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-324" href="#Footnote_C4-324" class="fnanchor">C4-324</a> He heard two more shots spaced “pretty well
even to me.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-325" href="#Footnote_C4-325" class="fnanchor">C4-325</a> After the third shot, he “revved that motorcycle up,”
drove to the northwest corner of Elm and Houston, and parked
approximately 10 feet from the traffic signal.<a id="FNanchor_C4-326" href="#Footnote_C4-326" class="fnanchor">C4-326</a> As he was parking
he noted that people were “falling, and they were rolling around down
there * * * grabbing their children” and rushing about.<a id="FNanchor_C4-327" href="#Footnote_C4-327" class="fnanchor">C4-327</a> A woman
screamed, “Oh, they have shot that man, they have shot that man.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-328" href="#Footnote_C4-328" class="fnanchor">C4-328</a>
Baker “had it in mind that the shots came from the top of this building
here,” so he ran straight to the entrance of the Depository Building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-329" href="#Footnote_C4-329" class="fnanchor">C4-329</a></p>

<p>Baker testified that he entered the lobby of the building and “spoke
out and asked where the stairs or elevator was * * * and this man,
Mr. Truly, spoke up and says, it seems to me like he says, ‘I am a
building manager. Follow me, officer, and I will show you.’”<a id="FNanchor_C4-330" href="#Footnote_C4-330" class="fnanchor">C4-330</a>
Baker and building superintendent Roy Truly went through a second
set of doors<a id="FNanchor_C4-331" href="#Footnote_C4-331" class="fnanchor">C4-331</a> and stopped at a swinging door where Baker bumped
into Truly’s back.<a id="FNanchor_C4-332" href="#Footnote_C4-332" class="fnanchor">C4-332</a> They went through the swinging door and continued
at “a good trot” to the northwest corner of the floor where Truly
hoped to find one of the two freight elevators. (See Commission
Exhibit No. 1061, <a href="#Page_148">p. 148</a>.) Neither elevator was there.<a id="FNanchor_C4-333" href="#Footnote_C4-333" class="fnanchor">C4-333</a> Truly
pushed the button for the west elevator which operates automatically
if the gate is closed.<a id="FNanchor_C4-334" href="#Footnote_C4-334" class="fnanchor">C4-334</a> He shouted twice, “Turn loose the elevator.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-335" href="#Footnote_C4-335" class="fnanchor">C4-335</a>
When the elevator failed to come, Baker said, “let’s take the stairs,”
and he followed Truly up the stairway, which is to the west of the
elevator.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span><a id="FNanchor_C4-336" href="#Footnote_C4-336" class="fnanchor">C4-336</a></p>

SHOWING ROUTE OF OSWALD</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
The stairway is located in the northwest corner of the Depository
Building. The stairs from one floor to the next are “<b class="sans">L</b>-shaped,” with
both legs of the “<b class="sans">L</b>” approximately the same length. Because the
stairway itself is enclosed, neither Baker nor Truly could see anything
on the second-floor hallway until they reached the landing at the top
of the stairs.<a id="FNanchor_C4-337" href="#Footnote_C4-337" class="fnanchor">C4-337</a> On the second-floor landing there is a small open
area with a door at the east end. This door leads into a small vestibule,
and another door leads from the vestibule into the second-floor lunchroom.<a id="FNanchor_C4-338" href="#Footnote_C4-338" class="fnanchor">C4-338</a>
(See Commission Exhibit No. 1118, <a href="#Page_150">p. 150</a>.) The lunchroom
door is usually open, but the first door is kept shut by a closing mechanism
on the door.<a id="FNanchor_C4-339" href="#Footnote_C4-339" class="fnanchor">C4-339</a> This vestibule door is solid except for a small glass
window in the upper part of the door.<a id="FNanchor_C4-340" href="#Footnote_C4-340" class="fnanchor">C4-340</a> As Baker reached the second
floor, he was about 20 feet from the vestibule door.<a id="FNanchor_C4-341" href="#Footnote_C4-341" class="fnanchor">C4-341</a> He intended
to continue around to his left toward the stairway going up but
through the window in the door he caught a fleeting glimpse of a man
walking in the vestibule toward the lunchroom.<a id="FNanchor_C4-342" href="#Footnote_C4-342" class="fnanchor">C4-342</a></p>

<p>Since the vestibule door is only a few feet from the lunchroom
door,<a id="FNanchor_C4-343" href="#Footnote_C4-343" class="fnanchor">C4-343</a> the man must have entered the vestibule only a second or two
before Baker arrived at the top of the stairwell. Yet he must have
entered the vestibule door before Truly reached the top of the stairwell,
since Truly did not see him.<a id="FNanchor_C4-344" href="#Footnote_C4-344" class="fnanchor">C4-344</a> If the man had passed from the
vestibule into the lunchroom, Baker could not have seen him. Baker
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He [Truly] had already started around the bend to come to the
next elevator going up, I was coming out this one on the second
floor, and I don’t know, I was kind of sweeping this area as I
come up, I was looking from right to left and as I got to this door
here I caught a glimpse of this man, just, you know, a sudden
glimpse * * * and it looked to me like he was going away from
me. * * *</p>

<p>I can’t say whether he had gone on through that door [the
lunchroom door] or not. All I did was catch a glance at him,
and evidently he was—this door might have been, you know,
closing and almost shut at that time.<a id="FNanchor_C4-345" href="#Footnote_C4-345" class="fnanchor">C4-345</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">With his revolver drawn, Baker opened the vestibule door and ran
into the vestibule. He saw a man walking away from him in the
lunchroom. Baker stopped at the door of the lunchroom and commanded,
“Come here.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-346" href="#Footnote_C4-346" class="fnanchor">C4-346</a> The man turned and walked back toward
Baker.<a id="FNanchor_C4-347" href="#Footnote_C4-347" class="fnanchor">C4-347</a> He had been proceeding toward the rear of the lunchroom.<a id="FNanchor_C4-348" href="#Footnote_C4-348" class="fnanchor">C4-348</a>
Along a side wall of the lunchroom was a soft drink vending
machine,<a id="FNanchor_C4-349" href="#Footnote_C4-349" class="fnanchor">C4-349</a> but at that time the man had nothing in his hands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span><a id="FNanchor_C4-350" href="#Footnote_C4-350" class="fnanchor">C4-350</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Truly had run up several steps toward the third floor.
Missing Baker, he came back to find the officer in the doorway to the
lunchroom “facing Lee Harvey Oswald.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-351" href="#Footnote_C4-351" class="fnanchor">C4-351</a> Baker turned to Truly
and said, “Do you know this man, does he work here?”<a id="FNanchor_C4-352" href="#Footnote_C4-352" class="fnanchor">C4-352</a> Truly
replied, “Yes.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-353" href="#Footnote_C4-353" class="fnanchor">C4-353</a> Baker stated later that the man did not seem to be
out of breath; he seemed calm. “He never did say a word or nothing.
In fact, he didn’t change his expression one bit.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-354" href="#Footnote_C4-354" class="fnanchor">C4-354</a> Truly said of
Oswald: “He didn’t seem to be excited or overly afraid or anything.
He might have been a bit startled, like I might have been if somebody
confronted me. But I cannot recall any change in expression of any
kind on his face.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-355" href="#Footnote_C4-355" class="fnanchor">C4-355</a> Truly thought that the officer’s gun at that
time appeared to be almost touching the middle portion of Oswald’s
body. Truly also noted at this time that Oswald’s hands were
empty.<a id="FNanchor_C4-356" href="#Footnote_C4-356" class="fnanchor">C4-356</a></p>

<p>In an effort to determine whether Oswald could have descended
to the lunchroom from the sixth floor by the time Baker and Truly
arrived, Commission counsel asked Baker and Truly to repeat their
movements from the time of the shot until Baker came upon Oswald
in the lunchroom. Baker placed himself on a motorcycle about 200 feet
from the corner of Elm and Houston Streets where he said he heard the
shots.<a id="FNanchor_C4-357" href="#Footnote_C4-357" class="fnanchor">C4-357</a> Truly stood in front of the building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-358" href="#Footnote_C4-358" class="fnanchor">C4-358</a> At a given signal,
they reenacted the event. Baker’s movements were timed with a
stopwatch. On the first test, the elapsed time between the simulated
first shot and Baker’s arrival on the second-floor stair landing was
1 minute and 30 seconds. The second test run required 1 minute and
15 seconds.<a id="FNanchor_C4-359" href="#Footnote_C4-359" class="fnanchor">C4-359</a></p>

<p>A test was also conducted to determine the time required to walk
from the southeast corner of the sixth floor to the second-floor lunchroom
by stairway. Special Agent John Howlett of the Secret Service
carried a rifle from the southeast corner of the sixth floor along the east
aisle to the northeast corner. He placed the rifle on the floor near the
site where Oswald’s rifle was actually found after the shooting.
Then Howlett walked down the stairway to the second-floor landing
and entered the lunchroom. The first test, run at normal walking pace,
required 1 minute, 18 seconds;<a id="FNanchor_C4-360" href="#Footnote_C4-360" class="fnanchor">C4-360</a> the second test, at a “fast walk” took
1 minute, 14 seconds.<a id="FNanchor_C4-361" href="#Footnote_C4-361" class="fnanchor">C4-361</a> The second test followed immediately after the
first. The only interval was the time necessary to ride in the elevator
from the second to the sixth floor and walk back to the southeast corner.
Howlett was not short winded at the end of either test run.<a id="FNanchor_C4-362" href="#Footnote_C4-362" class="fnanchor">C4-362</a></p>

<p>The minimum time required by Baker to park his motorcycle and
reach the second-floor lunchroom was within 3 seconds of the time
needed to walk from the southeast corner of the sixth floor down the
stairway to the lunchroom. The time actually required for Baker
and Truly to reach the second floor on November 22 was probably
longer than in the test runs. For example, Baker required 15 seconds
after the simulated shot to ride his motorcycle 180 to 200 feet, park it,
and run 45 feet to the building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-363" href="#Footnote_C4-363" class="fnanchor">C4-363</a> No allowance was made for the
special conditions which existed on the day of the assassination—possible
delayed reaction to the shot, jostling with the crowd of people on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
the steps and scanning the area along Elm Street and the parkway.<a id="FNanchor_C4-364" href="#Footnote_C4-364" class="fnanchor">C4-364</a>
Baker said, “We simulated the shots and by the time we got there, we
did everything that I did that day, and this would be the minimum,
because I am sure that I, you know, it took me a little longer.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-365" href="#Footnote_C4-365" class="fnanchor">C4-365</a> On
the basis of this time test, therefore, the Commission concluded that
Oswald could have fired the shots and still have been present in the
second-floor lunchroom when seen by Baker and Truly.</p>

<p>That Oswald descended by stairway from the sixth floor to the second-floor
lunchroom is consistent with the movements of the two elevators,
which would have provided the other possible means of descent.
When Truly, accompanied by Baker, ran to the rear of the first floor,
he was certain that both elevators, which occupy the same shaft,<a id="FNanchor_C4-366" href="#Footnote_C4-366" class="fnanchor">C4-366</a> were
on the fifth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C4-367" href="#Footnote_C4-367" class="fnanchor">C4-367</a> Baker, not realizing that there were two elevators,
thought that only one elevator was in the shaft and that it was
two or three floors above the second floor.<a id="FNanchor_C4-368" href="#Footnote_C4-368" class="fnanchor">C4-368</a> In the few seconds which
elapsed while Baker and Truly ran from the first to the second floor,
neither of these slow elevators could have descended from the fifth to
the second floor. Furthermore, no elevator was at the second floor
when they arrived there.<a id="FNanchor_C4-369" href="#Footnote_C4-369" class="fnanchor">C4-369</a> Truly and Baker continued up the stairs
after the encounter with Oswald in the lunchroom. There was no
elevator on the third or fourth floor. The east elevator was on the fifth
floor when they arrived; the west elevator was not. They took the east
elevator to the seventh floor and ran up a stairway to the roof where
they searched for several minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C4-370" href="#Footnote_C4-370" class="fnanchor">C4-370</a></p>

<p>Jack Dougherty, an employee working on the fifth floor, testified
that he took the west elevator to the first floor after hearing a noise
which sounded like a backfire.<a id="FNanchor_C4-371" href="#Footnote_C4-371" class="fnanchor">C4-371</a> Eddie Piper, the janitor, told
Dougherty that the President had been shot,<a id="FNanchor_C4-372" href="#Footnote_C4-372" class="fnanchor">C4-372</a> but in his testimony
Piper did not mention either seeing or talking with Dougherty during
these moments of excitement.<a id="FNanchor_C4-373" href="#Footnote_C4-373" class="fnanchor">C4-373</a> Both Dougherty and Piper were
confused witnesses. They had no exact memory of the events of that
afternoon. Truly was probably correct in stating that the west
elevator was on the fifth floor when he looked up the elevator shaft
from the first floor. The west elevator was not on the fifth floor when
Baker and Truly reached that floor, probably because Jack Dougherty
took it to the first floor while Baker and Truly were running up the
stairs or in the lunchroom with Oswald. Neither elevator could have
been used by Oswald as a means of descent.</p>

<p>Oswald’s use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of
other employees in the building. Three employees—James Jarman,
Jr., Harold Norman, and Bonnie Ray Williams—were watching the
parade from the fifth floor, directly below the window from which the
shots were fired. They rushed to the west windows after the shots
were fired and remained there until after they saw Patrolman Baker’s
white helmet on the fifth floor moving toward the elevator.<a id="FNanchor_C4-374" href="#Footnote_C4-374" class="fnanchor">C4-374</a> While
they were at the west windows their view of the stairwell was completely
blocked by shelves and boxes.<a id="FNanchor_C4-375" href="#Footnote_C4-375" class="fnanchor">C4-375</a> This is the period during
which Oswald would have descended the stairs. In all likelihood
Dougherty took the elevator down from the fifth floor after Jarman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Norman, and Williams ran to the west windows and were deciding
what to do. None of these three men saw Dougherty, probably because
of the anxiety of the moment and because of the books which
may have blocked the view.<a id="FNanchor_C4-376" href="#Footnote_C4-376" class="fnanchor">C4-376</a> Neither Jarman, Norman, Williams,
or Dougherty saw Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-377" href="#Footnote_C4-377" class="fnanchor">C4-377</a></p>

<p>Victoria Adams, who worked on the fourth floor of the Depository
Building, claimed that within about 1 minute following the shots she
ran from a window on the south side of the fourth floor,<a id="FNanchor_C4-378" href="#Footnote_C4-378" class="fnanchor">C4-378</a> down the
rear stairs to the first floor, where she encountered two Depository
employees—William Shelley and Billy Lovelady.<a id="FNanchor_C4-379" href="#Footnote_C4-379" class="fnanchor">C4-379</a> If her estimate
of time is correct, she reached the bottom of the stairs before Truly
and Baker started up, and she must have run down the stairs ahead
of Oswald and would probably have seen or heard him. Actually she
noticed no one on the back stairs. If she descended from the fourth
to the first floor as fast as she claimed in her testimony, she would have
seen Baker or Truly on the first floor or on the stairs, unless they were
already in the second-floor lunchroom talking to Oswald. When she
reached the first floor, she actually saw Shelley and Lovelady slightly
east of the east elevator.</p>

<p>Shelley and Lovelady, however, have testified that they were watching
the parade from the top step of the building entrance when Gloria
Calverly, who works in the Depository Building, ran up and said that
the President had been shot.<a id="FNanchor_C4-380" href="#Footnote_C4-380" class="fnanchor">C4-380</a> Lovelady and Shelley moved out
into the street.<a id="FNanchor_C4-381" href="#Footnote_C4-381" class="fnanchor">C4-381</a> About this time Shelley saw Truly and Patrolman
Baker go into the building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-382" href="#Footnote_C4-382" class="fnanchor">C4-382</a> Shelley and Lovelady, at a fast walk or
trot, turned west into the railroad yards and then to the west side of
the Depository Building. They reentered the building by the rear door
several minutes after Baker and Truly rushed through the front
entrance.<a id="FNanchor_C4-383" href="#Footnote_C4-383" class="fnanchor">C4-383</a> On entering, Lovelady saw a girl on the first floor who
he believes was Victoria Adams.<a id="FNanchor_C4-384" href="#Footnote_C4-384" class="fnanchor">C4-384</a> If Miss Adams accurately recalled
meeting Shelley and Lovelady when she reached the bottom of the
stairs, then her estimate of the time when she descended from the
fourth floor is incorrect, and she actually came down the stairs several
minutes after Oswald and after Truly and Baker as well.</p>

<p><i>Oswald’s departure from building.</i>—Within a minute after Baker
and Truly left Oswald in the lunchroom, Mrs. R. A. Reid, clerical
supervisor for the Texas School Book Depository, saw him walk
through the clerical office on the second floor toward the door leading
to the front stairway. Mrs. Reid had watched the parade from the
sidewalk in front of the building with Truly and Mr. O. V. Campbell,
vice president of the Depository.<a id="FNanchor_C4-385" href="#Footnote_C4-385" class="fnanchor">C4-385</a> She testified that she heard three
shots which she thought came from the building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-386" href="#Footnote_C4-386" class="fnanchor">C4-386</a> She ran inside
and up the front stairs into the large open office reserved for clerical
employees. As she approached her desk, she saw Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-387" href="#Footnote_C4-387" class="fnanchor">C4-387</a> He
was walking into the office from the back hallway, carrying a full
bottle of Coca-Cola in his hand,<a id="FNanchor_C4-388" href="#Footnote_C4-388" class="fnanchor">C4-388</a> presumably purchased after the
encounter with Baker and Truly. As Oswald passed Mrs. Reid
she said, “Oh, the President has been shot, but maybe they didn’t hit
him.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-389" href="#Footnote_C4-389" class="fnanchor">C4-389</a> Oswald mumbled something and walked by.<a id="FNanchor_C4-390" href="#Footnote_C4-390" class="fnanchor">C4-390</a> She paid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
no more attention to him. The only exit from the office in the direction
Oswald was moving was through the door to the front stairway.<a id="FNanchor_C4-391" href="#Footnote_C4-391" class="fnanchor">C4-391</a>
(See Commission Exhibit 1118, <a href="#Page_150">p. 150</a>.) Mrs. Reid testified that
when she saw Oswald, he was wearing a T-shirt and no jacket.<a id="FNanchor_C4-392" href="#Footnote_C4-392" class="fnanchor">C4-392</a>
When he left home that morning, Marina Oswald, who was still in
bed, suggested that he wear a jacket.<a id="FNanchor_C4-393" href="#Footnote_C4-393" class="fnanchor">C4-393</a> A blue jacket, later identified
by Marina Oswald as her husband’s,<a id="FNanchor_C4-394" href="#Footnote_C4-394" class="fnanchor">C4-394</a> was subsequently found in
the building,<a id="FNanchor_C4-395" href="#Footnote_C4-395" class="fnanchor">C4-395</a> apparently left behind by Oswald.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reid believes that she returned to her desk from the street
about 2 minutes after the shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C4-396" href="#Footnote_C4-396" class="fnanchor">C4-396</a> Reconstructing her movements,
Mrs. Reid ran the distance three times and was timed in 2 minutes by
stopwatch.<a id="FNanchor_C4-397" href="#Footnote_C4-397" class="fnanchor">C4-397</a> The reconstruction was the minimum time.<a id="FNanchor_C4-398" href="#Footnote_C4-398" class="fnanchor">C4-398</a> Accordingly,
she probably met Oswald at about 12:32, approximately 30-45
seconds after Oswald’s lunchroom encounter with Baker and Truly.
After leaving Mrs. Reid in the front office, Oswald could have gone
down the stairs and out the front door by 12:33 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C4-399" href="#Footnote_C4-399" class="fnanchor">C4-399</a>—3 minutes
after the shooting. At that time the building had not yet been sealed
off by the police.</p>

<p>While it was difficult to determine exactly when the police sealed
off the building, the earliest estimates would still have permitted
Oswald to leave the building by 12:33. One of the police officers assigned
to the corner of Elm and Houston Streets for the Presidential
motorcade, W.E. Barnett, testified that immediately after the shots
he went to the rear of the building to check the fire escape. He then
returned to the corner of Elm and Houston where he met a sergeant
who instructed him to find out the name of the building. Barnett ran
to the building, noted its name, and then returned to the corner.<a id="FNanchor_C4-400" href="#Footnote_C4-400" class="fnanchor">C4-400</a>
There he was met by a construction worker—in all likelihood Howard
Brennan, who was wearing his work helmet.<a id="FNanchor_C4-401" href="#Footnote_C4-401" class="fnanchor">C4-401</a> This worker told
Barnett that the shots had been fired from a window in the Depository
Building, whereupon Barnett posted himself at the front door to make
certain that no one left the building. The sergeant did the same
thing at the rear of the building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-402" href="#Footnote_C4-402" class="fnanchor">C4-402</a> Barnett estimated that approximately
3 minutes elapsed between the time he heard the last of the
shots and the time he started guarding the front door. According
to Barnett, “there were people going in and out” during this period.<a id="FNanchor_C4-403" href="#Footnote_C4-403" class="fnanchor">C4-403</a></p>

<p>Sgt. D. V. Harkness of the Dallas police said that to his knowledge
the building was not sealed off at 12:36 p.m. when he called in on
police radio that a witness (Amos Euins) had seen shots fired from
a window of the building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-404" href="#Footnote_C4-404" class="fnanchor">C4-404</a> At that time, Inspector Herbert V.
Sawyer’s car was parked in front of the building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-405" href="#Footnote_C4-405" class="fnanchor">C4-405</a> Harkness did
not know whether or not two officers with Sawyer were guarding the
doors.<a id="FNanchor_C4-406" href="#Footnote_C4-406" class="fnanchor">C4-406</a> At 12:34 p.m. Sawyer heard a call over the police radio
that the shots had come from the Depository Building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-407" href="#Footnote_C4-407" class="fnanchor">C4-407</a> He then
entered the building and took the front passenger elevator as far
as it would go—the fourth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C4-408" href="#Footnote_C4-408" class="fnanchor">C4-408</a> After inspecting this floor, Sawyer
returned to the street about 3 minutes after he entered the building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-409" href="#Footnote_C4-409" class="fnanchor">C4-409</a>
After he returned to the street he directed Sergeant Harkness to station
two patrolmen at the front door and not let anyone in or out;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
he also directed that the back door be sealed off.<a id="FNanchor_C4-410" href="#Footnote_C4-410" class="fnanchor">C4-410</a> This was no
earlier than 12:37 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C4-411" href="#Footnote_C4-411" class="fnanchor">C4-411</a> and may have been later. Special Agent
Forrest V. Sorrels of the Secret Service, who had been in the motorcade,
testified that after driving to Parkland Hospital, he returned
to the Depository Building about 20 minutes after the shooting, found
no police officers at the rear door and was able to enter through this
door without identifying himself.<a id="FNanchor_C4-412" href="#Footnote_C4-412" class="fnanchor">C4-412</a></p>

<p>Although Oswald probably left the building at about 12:33 p.m.,
his absence was not noticed until at least one-half hour later. Truly,
who had returned with Patrolman Baker from the roof, saw the
police questioning the warehouse employees. Approximately 15 men
worked in the warehouse<a id="FNanchor_C4-413" href="#Footnote_C4-413" class="fnanchor">C4-413</a> and Truly noticed that Oswald was not
among those being questioned.<a id="FNanchor_C4-414" href="#Footnote_C4-414" class="fnanchor">C4-414</a> Satisfying himself that Oswald was
missing, Truly obtained Oswald’s address, phone number, and description
from his employment application card. The address listed
was for the Paine home in Irving. Truly gave this information to
Captain Fritz who was on the sixth floor at the time<a id="FNanchor_C4-415" href="#Footnote_C4-415" class="fnanchor">C4-415</a>. Truly estimated
that he gave this information to Fritz about 15 or 20 minutes
after the shots,<a id="FNanchor_C4-416" href="#Footnote_C4-416" class="fnanchor">C4-416</a> but it was probably no earlier than 1:22 p.m., the
time when the rifle was found. Fritz believed that he learned of
Oswald’s absence after the rifle was found.<a id="FNanchor_C4-417" href="#Footnote_C4-417" class="fnanchor">C4-417</a> The fact that Truly
found Fritz in the northwest corner of the floor, near the point where
the rifle was found, supports Fritz’ recollection.</p>

<h4 id="hdr80">Conclusion</h4>

<p>Fingerprint and palmprint evidence establishes that Oswald handled
two of the four cartons next to the window and also handled a paper
bag which was found near the cartons. Oswald was seen in the vicinity
of the southeast corner of the sixth floor approximately 35 minutes before
the assassination and no one could be found who saw Oswald anywhere
else in the building until after the shooting. An eyewitness to
the shooting immediately provided a description of the man in the window
which was similar to Oswald’s actual appearance. This witness
identified Oswald in a lineup as the man most nearly resembling the
man he saw and later identified Oswald as the man he observed. Oswald’s
known actions in the building immediately after the assassination
are consistent with his having been at the southeast corner window
of the sixth floor at 12:30 p.m. On the basis of these findings the Commission
has concluded that Oswald, at the time of the assassination,
was present at the window from which the shots were fired.</p>

<h3 id="hdr81">THE KILLING OF PATROLMAN J. D. TIPPIT</h3>

<p>After leaving the Depository Building at approximately 12:33 p.m.,
Lee Harvey Oswald proceeded to his roominghouse by bus and taxi.
He arrived at approximately 1 p.m. and left a few minutes later. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
about 1:16 p.m., a Dallas police officer, J. D. Tippit, was shot less
than 1 mile from Oswald’s roominghouse. In deciding whether
Oswald killed Patrolman Tippit the Commission considered the following:
(1) positive identification of the killer by two eyewitnesses
who saw the shooting and seven eyewitnesses who heard the shots
and saw the gunman flee the scene with the revolver in his hand, (2)
testimony of firearms identification experts establishing the identity
of the murder weapon, (3) evidence establishing the ownership of
the murder weapon, (4) evidence establishing the ownership of a
zipper jacket found along the path of flight taken by the gunman
from the scene of the shooting to the place of arrest.</p>

<h4 id="hdr82">Oswald’s Movements After Leaving Depository Building</h4>

<p><i>The bus ride.</i>—According to the reconstruction of time and events
which the Commission found most credible, Lee Harvey Oswald left
the building approximately 3 minutes after the assassination. He
probably walked east on Elm Street for seven blocks to the corner
of Elm and Murphy where he boarded a bus which was heading back
in the direction of the Depository Building, on its way to the Oak
Cliff section of Dallas. (See Commission Exhibit 1119-A, <a href="#Page_158">p. 158</a>.)</p>

<p>When Oswald was apprehended, a bus transfer marked for the
Lakewood-Marsalis route was found in his shirt pocket.<a id="FNanchor_C4-418" href="#Footnote_C4-418" class="fnanchor">C4-418</a> The transfer
was dated “Fri. Nov. 22, ’63” and was punched in two places by
the busdriver. On the basis of this punchmark, which was distinctive
to each Dallas driver, the transfer was conclusively identified as
having been issued by Cecil J. McWatters, a busdriver for the Dallas
Transit Co.<a id="FNanchor_C4-419" href="#Footnote_C4-419" class="fnanchor">C4-419</a> On the basis of the date and time on the transfer,
McWatters was able to testify that the transfer had been issued by
him on a trip which passed a check point at St. Paul and Elm Streets
at 12:36 p.m., November 22, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-420" href="#Footnote_C4-420" class="fnanchor">C4-420</a></p>

<p>McWatters was sure that he left the checkpoint on time and he
estimated that it took him 3 to 4 minutes to drive three blocks west
from the checkpoint to Field Street, which he reached at about 12:40
p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C4-421" href="#Footnote_C4-421" class="fnanchor">C4-421</a> McWatters’ recollection is that he issued this transfer to a
man who entered his bus just beyond Field Street, where a man beat
on the front door of the bus, boarded it and paid his fare.<a id="FNanchor_C4-422" href="#Footnote_C4-422" class="fnanchor">C4-422</a> About
two blocks later, a woman asked to get off to make a 1 o’clock train
at Union Station and requested a transfer which she might use if she
got through the traffic.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * So I gave her a transfer and opened the door and she was
going out the gentleman I had picked up about two blocks [back]
asked for a transfer and got off at the same place in the middle
of the block where the lady did.</p>

<p>* * * It was the intersection near Lamar Street, it was near
Poydras and Lamar Street.<a id="FNanchor_C4-423" href="#Footnote_C4-423" class="fnanchor">C4-423</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
The man was on the bus approximately 4 minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C4-424" href="#Footnote_C4-424" class="fnanchor">C4-424</a></p>

<p>At about 6:30 p.m. on the day of the assassination, McWatters
viewed four men in a police lineup. He picked Oswald from the
lineup as the man who had boarded the bus at the “lower end of town
on Elm around Houston,” and who, during the ride south on Marsalis,
had an argument with a woman passenger.<a id="FNanchor_C4-425" href="#Footnote_C4-425" class="fnanchor">C4-425</a> In his Commission
testimony, McWatters said he had been in error and that a
teenager named Milton Jones was the passenger he had in mind.<a id="FNanchor_C4-426" href="#Footnote_C4-426" class="fnanchor">C4-426</a>
In a later interview, Jones confirmed that he had exchanged words
with a woman passenger on the bus during the ride south on Marsalis.<a id="FNanchor_C4-427" href="#Footnote_C4-427" class="fnanchor">C4-427</a>
McWatters also remembered that a man received a transfer
at Lamar and Elm Streets and that a man in the lineup was about the
size of this man.<a id="FNanchor_C4-428" href="#Footnote_C4-428" class="fnanchor">C4-428</a> However, McWatters’ recollection alone was too
vague to be a basis for placing Oswald on the bus.</p>

<p>Riding on the bus was an elderly woman, Mary Bledsoe, who confirmed
the mute evidence of the transfer. Oswald had rented a room
from Mrs. Bledsoe about 6 weeks before, on October 7,<a id="FNanchor_C4-429" href="#Footnote_C4-429" class="fnanchor">C4-429</a> but she had
asked him to leave at the end of a week. Mrs. Bledsoe told him “I
am not going to rent to you any more.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-430" href="#Footnote_C4-430" class="fnanchor">C4-430</a> She testified, “I didn’t
like his attitude. * * * There was just something about him I didn’t
like or want him. * * * Just didn’t want him around me.” <a id="FNanchor_C4-431" href="#Footnote_C4-431" class="fnanchor">C4-431</a> On
November 22, Mrs. Bledsoe came downtown to watch the Presidential
motorcade. She boarded the Marsalis bus at St. Paul and Elm Streets
to return home.<a id="FNanchor_C4-432" href="#Footnote_C4-432" class="fnanchor">C4-432</a> She testified further:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And, after we got past Akard, at Murphy—I figured it out.
Let’s see. I don’t know for sure. Oswald got on. He looks
like a maniac. His sleeve was out here. * * * His shirt was
undone.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>* * * he looked so bad in his face, and his face was so
distorted.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Hole in his sleeve right here.<a id="FNanchor_C4-433" href="#Footnote_C4-433" class="fnanchor">C4-433</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As Mrs. Bledsoe said these words, she pointed to her right elbow.<a id="FNanchor_C4-434" href="#Footnote_C4-434" class="fnanchor">C4-434</a>
When Oswald was arrested in the Texas Theatre, he was wearing a
brown sport shirt with a hole in the right sleeve at the elbow.<a id="FNanchor_C4-435" href="#Footnote_C4-435" class="fnanchor">C4-435</a> Mrs.
Bledsoe identified the shirt as the one Oswald was wearing and
she stated she was certain that it was Oswald who boarded the
bus.<a id="FNanchor_C4-436" href="#Footnote_C4-436" class="fnanchor">C4-436</a> Mrs. Bledsoe recalled that Oswald sat halfway to the rear of
the bus which moved slowly and intermittently as traffic became
heavy.<a id="FNanchor_C4-437" href="#Footnote_C4-437" class="fnanchor">C4-437</a> She heard a passing motorist tell the driver that the President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
had been shot.<a id="FNanchor_C4-438" href="#Footnote_C4-438" class="fnanchor">C4-438</a> People on the bus began talking about it. As
the bus neared Lamar Street, Oswald left the bus and disappeared
into the crowd.<a id="FNanchor_C4-439" href="#Footnote_C4-439" class="fnanchor">C4-439</a></p>

<p>The Marsalis bus which Oswald boarded traveled a route west on
Elm, south on Houston, and southwest across the Houston viaduct
to service the Oak Cliff area along Marsalis.<a id="FNanchor_C4-440" href="#Footnote_C4-440" class="fnanchor">C4-440</a> A Beckley bus which
also served the Oak Cliff area, followed the same route as the Marsalis
bus through downtown Dallas, except that it continued west on Elm,
across Houston in front of the Depository Building, past the Triple
Underpass into west Dallas, and south on Beckley.<a id="FNanchor_C4-441" href="#Footnote_C4-441" class="fnanchor">C4-441</a> Marsalis
Street is seven blocks from Beckley.<a id="FNanchor_C4-442" href="#Footnote_C4-442" class="fnanchor">C4-442</a> Oswald lived at 1026 North
Beckley.<a id="FNanchor_C4-443" href="#Footnote_C4-443" class="fnanchor">C4-443</a> He could not reach his roominghouse on the Marsalis
bus, but the Beckley bus stopped across the street.<a id="FNanchor_C4-444" href="#Footnote_C4-444" class="fnanchor">C4-444</a> According to
McWatters, the Beckley bus was behind the Marsalis bus, but he did
not actually see it.<a id="FNanchor_C4-445" href="#Footnote_C4-445" class="fnanchor">C4-445</a> Both buses stopped within one block of the
Depository Building. Instead of waiting there, Oswald apparently
went as far away as he could and boarded the first Oak Cliff bus which
came along rather than wait for one which stopped across the street
from his roominghouse.</p>

<p>In a reconstruction of this bus trip, agents of the Secret Service and
the FBI walked the seven blocks from the front entrance of the Depository
Building to Murphy and Elm three times, averaging 6½
minutes for the three trips.<a id="FNanchor_C4-446" href="#Footnote_C4-446" class="fnanchor">C4-446</a> A bus moving through heavy traffic
on Elm from Murphy to Lamar was timed at 4 minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C4-447" href="#Footnote_C4-447" class="fnanchor">C4-447</a> If Oswald
left the Depository Building at 12:33 p.m., walked seven blocks directly
to Murphy and Elm, and boarded a bus almost immediately,
he would have boarded the bus at approximately 12:40 p.m. and
left it at approximately 12:44 p.m. (See Commission Exhibit No.
1119-A, <a href="#Page_158">p. 158</a>.)</p>

<p>Roger D. Craig, a deputy sheriff of Dallas County, claimed that
about 15 minutes after the assassination he saw a man, whom he
later identified as Oswald,<a id="FNanchor_C4-448" href="#Footnote_C4-448" class="fnanchor">C4-448</a> coming from the direction of the Depository
Building and running down the hill north of Elm Street
toward a light-colored Rambler station wagon, which was moving
slowly along Elm toward the underpass.<a id="FNanchor_C4-449" href="#Footnote_C4-449" class="fnanchor">C4-449</a> The station wagon stopped
to pick up the man and then drove off.<a id="FNanchor_C4-450" href="#Footnote_C4-450" class="fnanchor">C4-450</a> Craig testified that later
in the afternoon he saw Oswald in the police interrogation room and
told Captain Fritz that Oswald was the man he saw.<a id="FNanchor_C4-451" href="#Footnote_C4-451" class="fnanchor">C4-451</a> Craig also
claimed that when Fritz pointed out to Oswald that Craig had identified
him, Oswald rose from his chair, looked directly at Fritz, and
said, “Everybody will know who I am now.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-452" href="#Footnote_C4-452" class="fnanchor">C4-452</a></p>

<p>The Commission could not accept important elements of Craig’s testimony.
Captain Fritz stated that a deputy sheriff whom he could not
identify did ask to see him that afternoon and told him a similar story
to Craig’s.<a id="FNanchor_C4-453" href="#Footnote_C4-453" class="fnanchor">C4-453</a> Fritz did not bring him into his office to identify Oswald
but turned him over to Lieutenant Baker for questioning. If Craig
saw Oswald that afternoon, he saw him through the glass windows
of the office. And neither Captain Fritz nor any other officer can
remember that Oswald dramatically arose from his chair and said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
“Everybody will know who I am now.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-454" href="#Footnote_C4-454" class="fnanchor">C4-454</a> If Oswald had made such
a statement, Captain Fritz and others present would probably have
remembered it. Craig may have seen a person enter a white Rambler
station wagon 15 or 20 minutes after the shooting and travel west on
Elm Street, but the Commission concluded that this man was not
Lee Harvey Oswald, because of the overwhelming evidence that
Oswald was far away from the building by that time.</p>

<p><i>The taxicab ride.</i>—William Whaley, a taxicab driver, told his employer
on Saturday morning, November 23, that he recognized Oswald
from a newspaper photograph as a man whom he had driven to the
Oak Cliff area the day before.<a id="FNanchor_C4-455" href="#Footnote_C4-455" class="fnanchor">C4-455</a> Notified of Whaley’s statement, the
police brought him to the police station that afternoon. He was taken
to the lineup room where, according to Whaley, five young teenagers,
all handcuffed together, were displayed with Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-456" href="#Footnote_C4-456" class="fnanchor">C4-456</a> He testified
that Oswald looked older than the other boys.<a id="FNanchor_C4-457" href="#Footnote_C4-457" class="fnanchor">C4-457</a> The police asked him
whether he could pick out his passenger from the lineup. Whaley
picked Oswald. He said,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * you could have picked him out without identifying him by
just listening to him because he was bawling out the policeman,
telling them it wasn’t right to put him in line with these teenagers
and all of that and they asked me which one and I told them. It
was him all right, the same man.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>He showed no respect for the policemen, he told them what
he thought about them. They knew what they were doing and
they were trying to railroad him and he wanted his lawyer.<a id="FNanchor_C4-458" href="#Footnote_C4-458" class="fnanchor">C4-458</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Whaley believes that Oswald’s conduct did not aid him in his identification
“because I knew he was the right one as soon as I saw
him.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-459" href="#Footnote_C4-459" class="fnanchor">C4-459</a></p>

<p>Whaley’s memory of the lineup is inaccurate. There were four
men altogether, not six men, in the lineup with Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-460" href="#Footnote_C4-460" class="fnanchor">C4-460</a> Whaley
said that Oswald was the man under No. 2.<a id="FNanchor_C4-461" href="#Footnote_C4-461" class="fnanchor">C4-461</a> Actually Oswald was
under No. 3. Only two of the men in the lineup with Oswald were
teenagers: John T. Horn, aged 18, was No. 1; David Knapp, aged 18,
was No. 2; Lee Oswald was No. 3; and Daniel Lujan, aged 26, was
No. 4.<a id="FNanchor_C4-462" href="#Footnote_C4-462" class="fnanchor">C4-462</a></p>

<p>When he first testified before the Commission, Whaley displayed a
trip manifest<a id="FNanchor_C4-463" href="#Footnote_C4-463" class="fnanchor">C4-463</a> which showed a 12 o’clock trip from Travis Hotel
to the Continental bus station, unloaded at 12:15 p.m., a 12:15 p.m.
pickup at Continental to Greyhound, unloaded at 12:30 p.m., and a
pickup from Greyhound (bus station) at 12:30 p.m., unloaded at 500
North Beckley at 12:45 p.m. Whaley testified that he did not keep an
accurate time record of his trips but recorded them by the quarter
hour, and that sometimes he made his entry right after a trip while
at other times he waited to record three or four trips.<a id="FNanchor_C4-464" href="#Footnote_C4-464" class="fnanchor">C4-464</a> As he unloaded
his Continental bus station passenger in front of Greyhound,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
he started to get out to buy a package of cigarettes.<a id="FNanchor_C4-465" href="#Footnote_C4-465" class="fnanchor">C4-465</a> He saw a man
walking south on Lamar from Commerce. The man was dressed in
faded blue color khaki work clothes, a brown shirt, and some kind of
work jacket that almost matched his pants.<a id="FNanchor_C4-466" href="#Footnote_C4-466" class="fnanchor">C4-466</a> The man asked, “May I
have the cab?”, and got into the front seat.<a id="FNanchor_C4-467" href="#Footnote_C4-467" class="fnanchor">C4-467</a> Whaley described the
ensuing events as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And about that time an old lady, I think she was an old lady,
I don’t remember nothing but her sticking her head down past
him in the door and said, “Driver, will you call me a cab down
here?”</p>

<p>She had seen him get this cab and she wanted one, too, and
he opened the door a little bit like he was going to get out and
he said, “I will let you have this one,” and she says, “No, the
driver can call me one.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>* * * I asked him where he wanted to go. And he said, “500
North Beckley.”</p>

<p>Well, I started up, I started to that address, and the police
cars, the sirens was going, running crisscrossing everywhere, just
a big uproar in that end of town and I said, “What the hell. I
wonder what the hell is the uproar?”</p>

<p>And he never said anything. So I figured he was one of these
people that don’t like to talk so I never said any more to him.</p>

<p>But when I got pretty close to 500 block at Neches and
North Beckley which is the 500 block, he said, “This will do
fine,” and I pulled over to the curb right there. He gave me a
dollar bill, the trip was 95 cents. He gave me a dollar bill and
didn’t say anything, just got out and closed the door and walked
around the front of the cab over to the other side of the street
[east side of the street]. Of course, the traffic was moving
through there and I put it in gear and moved on, that is the
last I saw of him.<a id="FNanchor_C4-468" href="#Footnote_C4-468" class="fnanchor">C4-468</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Whaley was somewhat imprecise as to where he unloaded his passenger.
He marked what he thought was the intersection of Neches
and Beckley on a map of Dallas with a large “X.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-469" href="#Footnote_C4-469" class="fnanchor">C4-469</a> He said, “Yes,
sir; that is right, because that is the 500 block of North Beckley.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-470" href="#Footnote_C4-470" class="fnanchor">C4-470</a>
However, Neches and Beckley do not intersect. Neches is within one-half
block of the roominghouse at 1026 North Beckley where Oswald
was living. The 500 block of North Beckley is five blocks south of
the roominghouse.<a id="FNanchor_C4-471" href="#Footnote_C4-471" class="fnanchor">C4-471</a></p>

<p>After a review of these inconsistencies in his testimony before the
Commission, Whaley was interviewed again in Dallas. The route
of the taxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.<a id="FNanchor_C4-472" href="#Footnote_C4-472" class="fnanchor">C4-472</a> He
directed the driver of the car to a point 20 feet north of the northwest
corner of the intersection of Beckley and Neely, the point at which
he said his passenger alighted.<a id="FNanchor_C4-473" href="#Footnote_C4-473" class="fnanchor">C4-473</a> This was the 700 block of North<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
Beckley.<a id="FNanchor_C4-474" href="#Footnote_C4-474" class="fnanchor">C4-474</a> The elapsed time of the reconstructed run from the
Greyhound Bus Station to Neely and Beckley was 5 minutes and
30 seconds by stopwatch.<a id="FNanchor_C4-475" href="#Footnote_C4-475" class="fnanchor">C4-475</a> The walk from Beckley and Neely to
1026 North Beckley was timed by Commission counsel at 5 minutes
and 45 seconds.<a id="FNanchor_C4-476" href="#Footnote_C4-476" class="fnanchor">C4-476</a></p>

<p>Whaley testified that Oswald was wearing either the gray zippered
jacket or the heavy blue jacket.<a id="FNanchor_C4-477" href="#Footnote_C4-477" class="fnanchor">C4-477</a> He was in error, however. Oswald
could not possibly have been wearing the blue jacket during the trip
with Whaley, since it was found in the “domino” room of the Depository
late in November.<a id="FNanchor_C4-478" href="#Footnote_C4-478" class="fnanchor">C4-478</a> Moreover, Mrs. Bledsoe saw Oswald
in the bus without a jacket and wearing a shirt with a hole at the
elbow.<a id="FNanchor_C4-479" href="#Footnote_C4-479" class="fnanchor">C4-479</a> On the other hand, Whaley identified Commission Exhibit
No. 150 (the shirt taken from Oswald upon arrest) as the shirt his
passenger was wearing.<a id="FNanchor_C4-480" href="#Footnote_C4-480" class="fnanchor">C4-480</a> He also stated he saw a silver identification
bracelet on his passenger’s left wrist.<a id="FNanchor_C4-481" href="#Footnote_C4-481" class="fnanchor">C4-481</a> Oswald was wearing such
a bracelet when he was arrested.<a id="FNanchor_C4-482" href="#Footnote_C4-482" class="fnanchor">C4-482</a></p>

<p>On November 22, Oswald told Captain Fritz that he rode a bus to
a stop near his home and then walked to his roominghouse.<a id="FNanchor_C4-483" href="#Footnote_C4-483" class="fnanchor">C4-483</a> When
queried the following morning concerning a bus transfer found in
his possession at the time of his arrest, he admitted receiving it.<a id="FNanchor_C4-484" href="#Footnote_C4-484" class="fnanchor">C4-484</a>
And when interrogated about a cab ride, Oswald also admitted that
he left the slow-moving bus and took a cab to his roominghouse.<a id="FNanchor_C4-485" href="#Footnote_C4-485" class="fnanchor">C4-485</a></p>

<p>The Greyhound Bus Station at Lamar and Jackson Streets, where
Oswald entered Whaley’s cab, is three to four short blocks south
of Lamar and Elm.<a id="FNanchor_C4-486" href="#Footnote_C4-486" class="fnanchor">C4-486</a> If Oswald left the bus at 12:44 p.m. and
walked directly to the terminal, he would have entered the cab at
12:47 or 12:48 p.m. If the cab ride was approximately 6 minutes,
as was the reconstructed ride, he would have reached his destination
at approximately 12:54 p.m. If he was discharged at Neely and
Beckley and walked directly to his roominghouse, he would have
arrived there about 12:59 to 1 p.m. From the 500 block of North
Beckley, the walk would be a few minutes longer, but in either event
he would have been in the roominghouse at about 1 p.m. This is
the approximate time he entered the roominghouse, according to
Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper there.<a id="FNanchor_C4-487" href="#Footnote_C4-487" class="fnanchor">C4-487</a> (See Commission Exhibit
No. 1119-A, <a href="#Page_158">p. 158</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Arrival and departure from roominghouse.</i>—Earlene Roberts,
housekeeper for Mrs. A.C. Johnson at 1026 North Beckley, knew
Lee Harvey Oswald under the alias of O. H. Lee. She first saw him
the day he rented a room at that address on October 14, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-488" href="#Footnote_C4-488" class="fnanchor">C4-488</a> He
signed his name as O. H. Lee on the roominghouse register.<a id="FNanchor_C4-489" href="#Footnote_C4-489" class="fnanchor">C4-489</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Roberts testified that on Thursday, November 21, Oswald did
not come home. On Friday, November 22, about 1 p.m., he entered
the house in unusual haste. She recalled that it was subsequent to the
time the President had been shot. After a friend had called and told
her, “President Kennedy has been shot,” she turned on the television.
When Oswald came in she said, “Oh, you are in a hurry,” but Oswald
did not respond. He hurried to his room and stayed no longer than
3 or 4 minutes. Oswald had entered the house in his shirt sleeves,
but when he left, he was zipping up a jacket. Mrs. Roberts saw him
a few seconds later standing near the bus stop in front of the house on
the east side of Beckley.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span><a id="FNanchor_C4-490" href="#Footnote_C4-490" class="fnanchor">C4-490</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Oswald was next seen about nine-tenths of a mile away at the southeast
corner of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, moments before the
Tippit shooting. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, <a href="#Page_158">p. 158</a>.)
If Oswald left his roominghouse shortly after 1 p.m. and walked at
a brisk pace, he would have reached 10th and Patton shortly after
1:15 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C4-491" href="#Footnote_C4-491" class="fnanchor">C4-491</a> Tippit’s murder was recorded on the police radio tape
at about 1:16 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C4-492" href="#Footnote_C4-492" class="fnanchor">C4-492</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr83">Description of Shooting</h4>

<p>Patrolman J. D. Tippit joined the Dallas Police Department in
July 1952.<a id="FNanchor_C4-493" href="#Footnote_C4-493" class="fnanchor">C4-493</a> He was described by Chief Curry as having the reputation
of being “a very fine, dedicated officer.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-494" href="#Footnote_C4-494" class="fnanchor">C4-494</a> Tippit patroled
district No. 78 in the Oak Cliff area of Dallas during daylight hours.
He drove a police car painted distinctive colors with No. 10 prominently
displayed on each side. Tippit rode alone, as only one man
was normally assigned to a patrol car in residential areas during daylight
shifts.<a id="FNanchor_C4-495" href="#Footnote_C4-495" class="fnanchor">C4-495</a></p>

<p>At about 12:44 p.m. on November 22, the radio dispatcher on channel
1 ordered all downtown patrol squads to report to Elm and
Houston, code 3 (emergency).<a id="FNanchor_C4-496" href="#Footnote_C4-496" class="fnanchor">C4-496</a> At 12:45 p.m. the dispatcher
ordered No. 78 (Tippit) to “move into central Oak Cliff area.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-497" href="#Footnote_C4-497" class="fnanchor">C4-497</a>
At 12:54 p.m., Tippit reported that he was in the central Oak Cliff
area at Lancaster and Eighth. The dispatcher ordered Tippit to be:
“* * * at large for any emergency that comes in.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-498" href="#Footnote_C4-498" class="fnanchor">C4-498</a> According to
Chief Curry, Tippit was free to patrol the central Oak Cliff area.<a id="FNanchor_C4-499" href="#Footnote_C4-499" class="fnanchor">C4-499</a>
Tippit must have heard the description of the suspect wanted for the
President’s shooting; it was broadcast over channel 1 at 12:45 p.m.,
again at 12:48 p.m., and again at 12:55 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C4-500" href="#Footnote_C4-500" class="fnanchor">C4-500</a> The suspect was
described as a “white male, approximately 30, slender build, height
5 foot 10 inches, weight 165 pounds.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-501" href="#Footnote_C4-501" class="fnanchor">C4-501</a> A similar description was
given on channel 2 at 12:45 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C4-502" href="#Footnote_C4-502" class="fnanchor">C4-502</a></p>

<p>At approximately 1:15 p.m., Tippit, who was cruising east on 10th
Street, passed the intersection of 10th and Patton, about eight blocks
from where he had reported at 12:54 p.m. About 100 feet past
the intersection Tippit stopped a man walking east along the south
side of Patton. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, <a href="#Page_164">p. 164</a>.)
The man’s general description was similar to the one broadcast over
the police radio. Tippit stopped the man and called him to his car.
He approached the car and apparently exchanged words with Tippit
through the right front or vent window. Tippit got out and started
to walk around the front of the car. As Tippit reached the left
front wheel the man pulled out a revolver and fired several shots.
Four bullets hit Tippit and killed him instantly. The gunman
started back toward Patton Avenue, ejecting the empty cartridge
cases before reloading with fresh bullets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<h4 id="hdr84">Eyewitnesses</h4>

<p>At least 12 persons saw the man with the revolver in the vicinity
of the Tippit crime scene at or immediately after the shooting. By
the evening of November 22, five of them had identified Lee Harvey
Oswald in police lineups as the man they saw. A sixth did so the
next day. Three others subsequently identified Oswald from a photograph.
Two witnesses testified that Oswald resembled the man they
had seen. One witness felt he was too distant from the gunman to
make a positive identification. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968,
<a href="#Page_164">p. 164</a>.)</p>

<p>A taxi driver, William Scoggins, was eating lunch in his cab which
was parked on Patton facing the southeast corner of 10th Street and
Patton Avenue a few feet to the north.<a id="FNanchor_C4-503" href="#Footnote_C4-503" class="fnanchor">C4-503</a> A police car moving east on
10th at about 10 or 12 miles an hour passed in front of his cab. About
100 feet from the corner the police car pulled up alongside a man on
the sidewalk. This man, dressed in a light-colored jacket, approached
the car. Scoggins lost sight of him behind some shrubbery on the
southeast corner lot, but he saw the policeman leave the car, heard three
or four shots, and then saw the policeman fall. Scoggins hurriedly left
his seat and hid behind the cab as the man came back toward the corner
with gun in hand. The man cut across the yard through some bushes,
passed within 12 feet of Scoggins, and ran south on Patton. Scoggins
saw him and heard him mutter either “Poor damn cop” or “Poor dumb
cop.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-504" href="#Footnote_C4-504" class="fnanchor">C4-504</a> The next day Scoggins viewed a lineup of four persons
and identified Oswald as the man whom he had seen the day before
at 10th and Patton.<a id="FNanchor_C4-505" href="#Footnote_C4-505" class="fnanchor">C4-505</a> In his testimony before the Commission,
Scoggins stated that he thought he had seen a picture of Oswald in
the newspapers prior to the lineup identification on Saturday. He
had not seen Oswald on television and had not been shown any photographs
of Oswald by the police.<a id="FNanchor_C4-506" href="#Footnote_C4-506" class="fnanchor">C4-506</a></p>

<p>Another witness, Domingo Benavides, was driving a pickup truck
west on 10th Street. As he crossed the intersection a block east of
10th and Patton, he saw a policeman standing by the left door of the
police car parked along the south side of 10th. Benavides saw a man
standing at the right side of the parked police car. He then heard
three shots and saw the policeman fall to the ground. By this time
the pickup truck was across the street and about 25 feet from
the police car. Benavides stopped and waited in the truck until the
gunman ran to the corner. He saw him empty the gun and throw the
shells into some bushes on the southeast corner lot.<a id="FNanchor_C4-507" href="#Footnote_C4-507" class="fnanchor">C4-507</a> It was
Benavides, using Tippit’s car radio, who first reported the killing of
Patrolman Tippit at about 1:16 p.m.: “We’ve had a shooting out
here.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-508" href="#Footnote_C4-508" class="fnanchor">C4-508</a> He found two empty shells in the bushes and gave them to
Patrolman J. M. Poe who arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C4-509" href="#Footnote_C4-509" class="fnanchor">C4-509</a>
Benavides never saw Oswald after the arrest. When questioned
by police officers on the evening of November 22, Benavides
told them that he did not think that he could identify the man who
fired the shots. As a result, they did not take him to the police station.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
He testified that the picture of Oswald which he saw later on television
bore a resemblance to the man who shot Officer Tippit.<a id="FNanchor_C4-510" href="#Footnote_C4-510" class="fnanchor">C4-510</a></p>

<p>Just prior to the shooting, Mrs. Helen Markham, a waitress in downtown
Dallas, was about to cross 10th Street at Patton. As she waited
on the northwest corner of the intersection for traffic to pass,<a id="FNanchor_C4-511" href="#Footnote_C4-511" class="fnanchor">C4-511</a> she
noticed a young man as he was “almost ready to get up on the
curb”<a id="FNanchor_C4-512" href="#Footnote_C4-512" class="fnanchor">C4-512</a> at the southeast corner of the intersection, approximately
50 feet away. The man continued along 10th Street. Mrs. Markham
saw a police car slowly approach the man from the rear and stop
alongside of him. She saw the man come to the right window of the
police car. As he talked, he leaned on the ledge of the right window
with his arms. The man appeared to step back as the policeman
“calmly opened the car door” and very slowly got out and walked
toward the front of the car. The man pulled a gun. Mrs. Markham
heard three shots and saw the policeman fall to the ground near the
left front wheel. She raised her hands to her eyes as the man started
to walk back toward Patton.<a id="FNanchor_C4-513" href="#Footnote_C4-513" class="fnanchor">C4-513</a> She peered through her fingers,
lowered her hands, and saw the man doing something with his gun.
“He was just fooling with it. I didn’t know what he was doing.
I was afraid he was fixing to kill me.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-514" href="#Footnote_C4-514" class="fnanchor">C4-514</a> The man “in kind of a
little trot” headed down Patton toward Jefferson Boulevard, a block
away. Mrs. Markham then ran to Officer Tippit’s side and saw him
lying in a pool of blood.<a id="FNanchor_C4-515" href="#Footnote_C4-515" class="fnanchor">C4-515</a></p>

<p>Helen Markham was screaming as she leaned over the body.<a id="FNanchor_C4-516" href="#Footnote_C4-516" class="fnanchor">C4-516</a> A
few minutes later she described the gunman to a policeman.<a id="FNanchor_C4-517" href="#Footnote_C4-517" class="fnanchor">C4-517</a> Her
description and that of other eyewitnesses led to the police broadcast
at 1:22 p.m. describing the slayer as “about 30, 5’8”, black hair,
slender.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-518" href="#Footnote_C4-518" class="fnanchor">C4-518</a> At about 4:30 p.m., Mrs. Markham, who had been
greatly upset by her experience, was able to view a lineup of
four men handcuffed together at the police station.<a id="FNanchor_C4-519" href="#Footnote_C4-519" class="fnanchor">C4-519</a> She identified
Lee Harvey Oswald as the man who shot the policeman.<a id="FNanchor_C4-520" href="#Footnote_C4-520" class="fnanchor">C4-520</a> Detective
L. C. Graves, who had been with Mrs. Markham before the
lineup testified that she was “quite hysterical” and was “crying and
upset.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-521" href="#Footnote_C4-521" class="fnanchor">C4-521</a> He said that Mrs. Markham started crying when Oswald
walked into the lineup room.<a id="FNanchor_C4-522" href="#Footnote_C4-522" class="fnanchor">C4-522</a> In testimony before the Commission,
Mrs. Markham confirmed her positive identification of Lee Harvey
Oswald as the man she saw kill Officer Tippit.<a id="FNanchor_C4-523" href="#Footnote_C4-523" class="fnanchor">C4-523</a></p>

<p>In evaluating Mrs. Markham’s identification of Oswald, the Commission
considered certain allegations that Mrs. Markham described
the man who killed Patrolman Tippit as “short, a little on the heavy
side,” and having “somewhat bushy” hair.<a id="FNanchor_C4-524" href="#Footnote_C4-524" class="fnanchor">C4-524</a> The Commission reviewed
the transcript of a phone conversation in which Mrs. Markham
is alleged to have provided such a description.<a id="FNanchor_C4-525" href="#Footnote_C4-525" class="fnanchor">C4-525</a> A review of the
complete transcript has satisfied the Commission that Mrs. Markham
strongly reaffirmed her positive identification of Oswald and denied
having described the killer as short, stocky and having bushy hair.
She stated that the man weighed about 150 pounds.<a id="FNanchor_C4-526" href="#Footnote_C4-526" class="fnanchor">C4-526</a> Although
she used the words “a little bit bushy” to describe the gunman’s hair,
the transcript establishes that she was referring to the uncombed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
state of his hair, a description fully supported by a photograph of
Oswald taken at the time of his arrest. (See Pizzo Exhibit No.
453-C, <a href="#Page_177">p. 177</a>.) Although in the phone conversation she described
the man as “short,”<a id="FNanchor_C4-527" href="#Footnote_C4-527" class="fnanchor">C4-527</a> on November 22, within minutes of the shooting
and before the lineup, Mrs. Markham described the man to the police
as 5’8” tall.<a id="FNanchor_C4-528" href="#Footnote_C4-528" class="fnanchor">C4-528</a></p>

<p>During her testimony Mrs. Markham initially denied that she ever
had the above phone conversation.<a id="FNanchor_C4-529" href="#Footnote_C4-529" class="fnanchor">C4-529</a> She has subsequently admitted
the existence of the conversation and offered an explanation for her
denial.<a id="FNanchor_C4-530" href="#Footnote_C4-530" class="fnanchor">C4-530</a> Addressing itself solely to the probative value of Mrs.
Markham’s contemporaneous description of the gunman and her positive
identification of Oswald at a police lineup, the Commission considers
her testimony reliable. However, even in the absence of Mrs.
Markham’s testimony, there is ample evidence to identify Oswald as
the killer of Tippit.</p>

<p>Two young women, Barbara Jeanette Davis and Virginia Davis,
were in an apartment of a multiple-unit house on the southeast corner
of 10th and Patton when they heard the sound of gunfire and the
screams of Helen Markham. They ran to the door in time to see
a man with a revolver cut across their lawn and disappear around
a corner of the house onto Patton.<a id="FNanchor_C4-531" href="#Footnote_C4-531" class="fnanchor">C4-531</a> Barbara Jeanette Davis assumed
that he was emptying his gun as “he had it open and was shaking
it.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-532" href="#Footnote_C4-532" class="fnanchor">C4-532</a> She immediately called the police. Later in the day each
woman found an empty shell on the ground near the house. These
two shells were delivered to the police.<a id="FNanchor_C4-533" href="#Footnote_C4-533" class="fnanchor">C4-533</a></p>

<p>On the evening of November 22, Barbara Jeanette and Virginia
Davis viewed a group of four men in a lineup and each one picked
Oswald as the man who crossed their lawn while emptying his
pistol.<a id="FNanchor_C4-534" href="#Footnote_C4-534" class="fnanchor">C4-534</a> Barbara Jeanette Davis testified that no one had shown her
a picture of Oswald before the identification and that she had not
seen him on television. She was not sure whether she had seen his
picture in a newspaper on the afternoon or evening of November 22
prior to the lineup.<a id="FNanchor_C4-535" href="#Footnote_C4-535" class="fnanchor">C4-535</a> Her reaction when she saw Oswald in the
lineup was that “I was pretty sure it was the same man I saw. When
they made him turn sideways, I was positive that was the one I
seen.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-536" href="#Footnote_C4-536" class="fnanchor">C4-536</a> Similarly, Virginia Davis had not been shown pictures of
anyone prior to the lineup and had not seen either television or the

that she was the first to make the identification.<a id="FNanchor_C4-541" href="#Footnote_C4-541" class="fnanchor">C4-541</a></p>

<p>William Arthur Smith was about a block east of 10th and Patton
when he heard shots. He looked west on 10th and saw a man running
to the west and a policeman falling to the ground. Smith failed to
make himself known to the police on November 22. Several days
later he reported what he had seen and was questioned by FBI<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
agents.<a id="FNanchor_C4-542" href="#Footnote_C4-542" class="fnanchor">C4-542</a> Smith subsequently told a Commission staff member that
he saw Oswald on television the night of the murder and thought that
Oswald was the man he had seen running away from the shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C4-543" href="#Footnote_C4-543" class="fnanchor">C4-543</a>
On television Oswald’s hair looked blond, whereas Smith
remembered that the man who ran away had hair that was
brown or brownish black. Later, the FBI showed Smith a picture
of Oswald. In the picture the hair was brown.<a id="FNanchor_C4-544" href="#Footnote_C4-544" class="fnanchor">C4-544</a> According to his
testimony, Smith told the FBI, “It looked more like him than it did
on television.” He stated further that from “What I saw of him”
the man looked like the man in the picture.<a id="FNanchor_C4-545" href="#Footnote_C4-545" class="fnanchor">C4-545</a></p>

<p>Two other important eyewitnesses to Oswald’s flight were Ted
Callaway, manager of a used-car lot on the northeast corner
of Patton Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard, and Sam Guinyard,
a porter at the lot. They heard the sound of shots to the
north of their lot.<a id="FNanchor_C4-546" href="#Footnote_C4-546" class="fnanchor">C4-546</a> Callaway heard five shots, and Guinyard
three. Both ran to the sidewalk on the east side of Patton
at a point about a half a block south of 10th. They saw a
man coming south on Patton with a revolver held high in his right
hand. According to Callaway, the man crossed to the west side of
Patton.<a id="FNanchor_C4-547" href="#Footnote_C4-547" class="fnanchor">C4-547</a> From across the street Callaway yelled, “Hey, man, what
the hell is going on?” He slowed down, halted, said something,
and then kept on going to the corner, turned right, and continued
west on Jefferson.<a id="FNanchor_C4-548" href="#Footnote_C4-548" class="fnanchor">C4-548</a> Guinyard claimed that the man
ran down the east side of Patton and passed within 10 feet
of him before crossing to the other side.<a id="FNanchor_C4-549" href="#Footnote_C4-549" class="fnanchor">C4-549</a> Guinyard and Callaway
ran to 10th and Patton and found Tippit lying in the
street beside his car.<a id="FNanchor_C4-550" href="#Footnote_C4-550" class="fnanchor">C4-550</a> Apparently he had reached for his gun;
it lay beneath him outside of the holster. Callaway picked up
the gun.<a id="FNanchor_C4-551" href="#Footnote_C4-551" class="fnanchor">C4-551</a> He and Scoggins attempted to chase down the gunman
in Scoggin’s taxicab,<a id="FNanchor_C4-552" href="#Footnote_C4-552" class="fnanchor">C4-552</a> but he had disappeared. Early in the evening
of November 22, Guinyard and Callaway viewed the same lineup of
four men from which Mrs. Markham had earlier made her identification
of Lee Harvey Oswald. Both men picked Oswald as the man
who had run south on Patton with a gun in his hand.<a id="FNanchor_C4-553" href="#Footnote_C4-553" class="fnanchor">C4-553</a> Callaway
told the Commission: “So they brought four men in. I stepped to the
back of the room, so I could kind of see him from the same distance
which I had seen him before. And when he came out I knew him.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-554" href="#Footnote_C4-554" class="fnanchor">C4-554</a>
Guinyard said, “I told them that was him right there. I pointed him
out right there.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-555" href="#Footnote_C4-555" class="fnanchor">C4-555</a> Both Callaway and Guinyard testified that they
had not been shown any pictures by the police before the lineup.<a id="FNanchor_C4-556" href="#Footnote_C4-556" class="fnanchor">C4-556</a></p>

<p>The Dallas Police Department furnished the Commission with pictures
of the men who appeared in the lineups with Oswald,<a id="FNanchor_C4-557" href="#Footnote_C4-557" class="fnanchor">C4-557</a> and the
Commission has inquired into general lineup procedures used by the
Dallas police as well as the specific procedures in the lineups involving
Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-558" href="#Footnote_C4-558" class="fnanchor">C4-558</a> The Commission is satisfied that the lineups were conducted
fairly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
As Oswald ran south on Patton Avenue toward Jefferson Boulevard
he was moving in the direction of a used-car lot located on the southeast
corner of this intersection.<a id="FNanchor_C4-559" href="#Footnote_C4-559" class="fnanchor">C4-559</a> Four men—Warren Reynolds,<a id="FNanchor_C4-560" href="#Footnote_C4-560" class="fnanchor">C4-560</a>
Harold Russell,<a id="FNanchor_C4-561" href="#Footnote_C4-561" class="fnanchor">C4-561</a> Pat Patterson,<a id="FNanchor_C4-562" href="#Footnote_C4-562" class="fnanchor">C4-562</a> and L. J. Lewis<a id="FNanchor_C4-563" href="#Footnote_C4-563" class="fnanchor">C4-563</a>—were on the
lot at the time, and they saw a white male with a revolver in his hands
running south on Patton. When the man reached Jefferson, he turned
right and headed west. Reynolds and Patterson decided to follow
him. When he reached a gasoline service station one block away he
turned north and walked toward a parking area in the rear of the
station. Neither Reynolds nor Patterson saw the man after he turned
off Jefferson at the service station.<a id="FNanchor_C4-564" href="#Footnote_C4-564" class="fnanchor">C4-564</a> These four witnesses were interviewed
by FBI agents 2 months after the shooting. Russell and
Patterson were shown a picture of Oswald and they stated that Oswald
was the man they saw on November 22, 1963. Russell confirmed this
statement in a sworn affidavit for the Commission.<a id="FNanchor_C4-565" href="#Footnote_C4-565" class="fnanchor">C4-565</a> Patterson, when
asked later to confirm his identification by affidavit said he did not
recall having been shown the photograph. He was then shown two
photographs of Oswald and he advised that Oswald was “unquestionably”
the man he saw.<a id="FNanchor_C4-566" href="#Footnote_C4-566" class="fnanchor">C4-566</a> Reynolds did not make a positive identification
when interviewed by the FBI, but he subsequently testified before
a Commission staff member and, when shown two photographs of
Oswald, stated that they were photographs of the man he saw.<a id="FNanchor_C4-567" href="#Footnote_C4-567" class="fnanchor">C4-567</a> L. J.
Lewis said in an interview that because of the distance from which he
observed the gunman he would hesitate to state whether the man was
identical with Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-568" href="#Footnote_C4-568" class="fnanchor">C4-568</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr85">Murder Weapon</h4>

<p>When Oswald was arrested, he had in his possession a Smith &amp;
Wesson .38 Special caliber revolver, serial number V510210. (See
Commission Exhibit No. 143, <a href="#Page_170">p. 170</a>). Two of the arresting officers
placed their initials on the weapon and a third inscribed his name.
All three identified Exhibit No. 143 as the revolver taken from Oswald
when he was arrested.<a id="FNanchor_C4-569" href="#Footnote_C4-569" class="fnanchor">C4-569</a> Four cartridge cases were found in the
shrubbery on the corner of 10th and Patton by three of the eyewitnesses—Domingo
Benavides, Barbara Jeanette Davis, and Virginia
Davis.<a id="FNanchor_C4-570" href="#Footnote_C4-570" class="fnanchor">C4-570</a> It was the unanimous and unequivocal testimony of expert
witnesses before the Commission that these used cartridge cases were
fired from the revolver in Oswald’s possession to the exclusion of all
other weapons. (See app. X, <a href="#Page_559">p. 559</a>.)</p>

<p>Cortlandt Cunningham, of the Firearms Identification Unit of the
FBI Laboratory, testified that he compared the four empty cartridge
cases found near the scene of the shooting with a test cartridge
fired from the weapon in Oswald’s possession when he was arrested. Cunningham
declared that this weapon fired the four cartridges to the
exclusion of all other weapons. Identification was effected through
breech face marks and firing pin marks.<a id="FNanchor_C4-571" href="#Footnote_C4-571" class="fnanchor">C4-571</a> Robert A. Frazier and
Charles Killion, other FBI firearms experts, independently examined
the four cartridge cases and arrived at the same conclusion as Cunningham.<a id="FNanchor_C4-572" href="#Footnote_C4-572" class="fnanchor">C4-572</a>
At the request of the Commission, Joseph D. Nicol,
superintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Criminal Identification Investigation,
also examined the four cartridge cases found near the
site of the homicide and compared them with the test cartridge cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
fired from the Smith &amp; Wesson revolver taken from Oswald. He
concluded that all of these cartridges were fired from the same
weapon.<a id="FNanchor_C4-573" href="#Footnote_C4-573" class="fnanchor">C4-573</a></p>

<p>Cunningham compared four lead bullets recovered from the body
of Patrolman Tippit with test bullets fired from Oswald’s revolver.<a id="FNanchor_C4-574" href="#Footnote_C4-574" class="fnanchor">C4-574</a>
He explained that the bullets were slightly smaller than the barrel of
the pistol which had fired them. This caused the bullets to have an
erratic passage through the barrel and impressed upon the lead of the
bullets inconsistent individual characteristics which made identification
impossible. Consecutive bullets fired from the revolver by the
FBI experts could not be identified as having been fired from that
revolver.<a id="FNanchor_C4-575" href="#Footnote_C4-575" class="fnanchor">C4-575</a> (See app. X, <a href="#Page_559">p. 559</a>.) Cunningham testified that all of the
bullets were mutilated, one being useless for comparison purposes. All
four bullets were fired from a weapon with five lands and grooves and a
right twist<a id="FNanchor_C4-576" href="#Footnote_C4-576" class="fnanchor">C4-576</a> which were the rifling characteristics of the revolver
taken from Oswald. He concluded, however, that he could not say
whether the four bullets were fired from the revolver in Oswald’s
possession.<a id="FNanchor_C4-577" href="#Footnote_C4-577" class="fnanchor">C4-577</a> “The only thing I can testify is they could have on the
basis of the rifling characteristics—they could have been.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-578" href="#Footnote_C4-578" class="fnanchor">C4-578</a></p>

<p>Nicol differed with the FBI experts on one bullet taken from Tippit’s
body. He declared that this bullet<a id="FNanchor_C4-579" href="#Footnote_C4-579" class="fnanchor">C4-579</a> was fired from the same
weapon that fired the test bullets to the exclusion of all other weapons.
But he agreed that because the other three bullets were mutilated, he
could not determine if they had been fired from the same weapon as
the test bullets.<a id="FNanchor_C4-580" href="#Footnote_C4-580" class="fnanchor">C4-580</a></p>

<p>The examination and testimony of the experts enabled the Commission
to conclude that five shots may have been fired, even though only
four bullets were recovered. Three of the bullets recovered from Tippit’s
body were manufactured by Winchester-Western, and the fourth
bullet by Remington-Peters, but only two of the four discarded cartridge
cases found on the lawn at 10th Street and Patton Avenue were
of Winchester-Western manufacture.<a id="FNanchor_C4-581" href="#Footnote_C4-581" class="fnanchor">C4-581</a> Therefore, one cartridge
case of this type was not recovered. And though only one bullet of
Remington-Peters manufacture was recovered, two empty cartridge
cases of that make were retrieved. Therefore, either one bullet of
Remington-Peters manufacture is missing or one used Remington-Peters
cartridge case, which may have been in the revolver before the
shooting, was discarded along with the others as Oswald left the
scene. If a bullet is missing, five were fired. This corresponds with
the observation and memory of Ted Callaway,<a id="FNanchor_C4-582" href="#Footnote_C4-582" class="fnanchor">C4-582</a> and possibly Warren
Reynolds, but not with the other eyewitnesses who claim to have heard
from two to four shots.</p>

<h4 id="hdr86">Ownership of Revolver</h4>

<p>By checking certain importers and dealers after the assassination
of President Kennedy and slaying of Officer Tippit, agents of the FBI
determined that George Rose &amp; Co. of Los Angeles was a major distributor
of this type of revolver.<a id="FNanchor_C4-583" href="#Footnote_C4-583" class="fnanchor">C4-583</a> Records of Seaport Traders,
Inc., a mail-order division of George Rose &amp; Co., disclosed that on
January 3, 1963, the company received from Empire Wholesale
Sporting Goods, Ltd., Montreal, a shipment of 99 guns in one case.
Among these guns was a .38 Special caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver,
serial No. V510210, the only revolver made by Smith &amp; Wesson with
this serial number.<a id="FNanchor_C4-584" href="#Footnote_C4-584" class="fnanchor">C4-584</a> When first manufactured, it had a 5-inch barrel.
George Rose &amp; Co. had the barrel shortened by a gunsmith to 2¼
inches.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span><a id="FNanchor_C4-585" href="#Footnote_C4-585" class="fnanchor">C4-585</a></p>

Sometime after January 27, 1963, Seaport Traders, Inc., received
through the mail a mail-order coupon for one “.38 St. W. 2” Bbl.,”
cost $29.95. Ten dollars in cash was enclosed. The order was signed
in ink by “A. J. Hidell, aged 28.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-586" href="#Footnote_C4-586" class="fnanchor">C4-586</a> (See Commission Exhibit No.
790, <a href="#Page_173">p. 173</a>.) The date of the order was January 27 (no year shown),
and the return address was Post Office Box 2915, Dallas, Tex. Also
on the order form was an order, written in ink, for one box of
ammunition and one holster, but a line was drawn through these
items. The mail-order form had a line for the name of a witness
to attest that the person ordering the gun was a U.S. citizen and had
not been convicted of a felony. The name written in this space was
D. F. Drittal.<a id="FNanchor_C4-587" href="#Footnote_C4-587" class="fnanchor">C4-587</a></p>

<p>Heinz W. Michaelis, office manager of both George Rose &amp; Co., Inc.,
and Seaport Traders, Inc., identified records of Seaport Traders, Inc.,
which showed that a “.38 S and W Special two-inch Commando,
serial number V510210” was shipped on March 20, 1963, to A. J.
Hidell, Post Office Box 2915, Dallas, Tex. The invoice was prepared
on March 13, 1963; the revolver was actually shipped on March 20
by Railway Express. The balance due on the purchase was $19.95.
Michaelis furnished the shipping copy of the invoice, and the Railway
Express Agency shipping documents, showing that $19.95, plus
$1.27 shipping charge, had been collected from the consignee, Hidell.<a id="FNanchor_C4-588" href="#Footnote_C4-588" class="fnanchor">C4-588</a>
(See Michaelis Exhibits Nos. 2, 4, 5, <a href="#Page_173">p. 173</a>.)</p>

<p>Handwriting experts, Alwyn Cole of the Treasury Department and
James C. Cadigan of the FBI, testified before the Commission that
the writing on the coupon was Oswald’s. The signature of the witness,
D. F. Drittal, who attested that the fictitious Hidell was an
American citizen and had not been convicted of a felony, was also
in Oswald’s handwriting.<a id="FNanchor_C4-589" href="#Footnote_C4-589" class="fnanchor">C4-589</a> Marina Oswald gave as her opinion
that the mail-order coupon was in Oswald’s handwriting.<a id="FNanchor_C4-590" href="#Footnote_C4-590" class="fnanchor">C4-590</a> When
shown the revolver, she stated that she recognized it as the one owned
by her husband.<a id="FNanchor_C4-591" href="#Footnote_C4-591" class="fnanchor">C4-591</a> She also testified that this appeared to be the
revolver seen in Oswald’s belt in the picture she took in late March
or early April 1963 when the family was living on Neely Street in
Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C4-592" href="#Footnote_C4-592" class="fnanchor">C4-592</a> Police found an empty revolver holster when they searched
Oswald’s room on Beckley Avenue after his arrest.<a id="FNanchor_C4-593" href="#Footnote_C4-593" class="fnanchor">C4-593</a> Marina Oswald
testified that this was the holster which contained the revolver in

<h4 id="hdr87">Oswald’s Jacket</h4>

<p>Approximately 15 minutes before the shooting of Tippit, Oswald
was seen leaving his roominghouse.<a id="FNanchor_C4-595" href="#Footnote_C4-595" class="fnanchor">C4-595</a> He was wearing a zipper
jacket which he had not been wearing moments before when he had
arrived home.<a id="FNanchor_C4-596" href="#Footnote_C4-596" class="fnanchor">C4-596</a> When Oswald was arrested, he did not have a
jacket.<a id="FNanchor_C4-597" href="#Footnote_C4-597" class="fnanchor">C4-597</a> Shortly after Tippit was slain, policemen found a light-colored
zipper jacket along the route taken by the killer as he attempted
to escape.<a id="FNanchor_C4-598" href="#Footnote_C4-598" class="fnanchor">C4-598</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, <a href="#Page_164">p. 164</a>.)</p>

<p>At 1:22 p.m. the Dallas police radio described the man wanted for
the murder of Tippit as “a white male about thirty, five foot eight
inches, black hair, slender, wearing a white jacket, white shirt and
dark slacks.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-599" href="#Footnote_C4-599" class="fnanchor">C4-599</a> According to Patrolman Poe this description came
from Mrs. Markham and Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis.<a id="FNanchor_C4-600" href="#Footnote_C4-600" class="fnanchor">C4-600</a> Mrs.
Markham told Poe that the man was a “white male, about 25, about
five feet eight, brown hair, medium,” and wearing a “white jacket.”
Mrs. Davis gave Poe the same general description: a “white male in
his early twenties, around five foot seven inches or eight inches, about
145 pounds,” and wearing a white jacket.</p>

<p>As has been discussed previously, two witnesses, Warren Reynolds
and B. M. Patterson, saw the gunman run toward the rear of a gasoline
service station on Jefferson Boulevard. Mrs. Mary Brock, the
wife of a mechanic who worked at the station, was there at the time
and she saw a white male, “5 feet, 10 inches * * * wearing light
clothing * * * a light-colored jacket” walk past her at a fast pace
with his hands in his pocket. She last saw him in the parking lot
directly behind the service station. When interviewed by FBI agents
on January 21, 1964, she identified a picture of Oswald as being the
same person she saw on November 22. She confirmed this interview
by a sworn affidavit.<a id="FNanchor_C4-601" href="#Footnote_C4-601" class="fnanchor">C4-601</a></p>

<p>At 1:24 p.m., the police radio reported, “The suspect last seen running
west on Jefferson from 400 East Jefferson.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-602" href="#Footnote_C4-602" class="fnanchor">C4-602</a> Police Capt. W.
R. Westbrook and several other officers concentrated their search along
Jefferson Boulevard.<a id="FNanchor_C4-603" href="#Footnote_C4-603" class="fnanchor">C4-603</a> Westbrook walked through the parking lot
behind the service station<a id="FNanchor_C4-604" href="#Footnote_C4-604" class="fnanchor">C4-604</a> and found a light-colored jacket lying
under the rear of one of the cars.<a id="FNanchor_C4-605" href="#Footnote_C4-605" class="fnanchor">C4-605</a> Westbrook identified Commission
Exhibit No. 162 as the light-colored jacket which he discovered
underneath the automobile.<a id="FNanchor_C4-606" href="#Footnote_C4-606" class="fnanchor">C4-606</a></p>

<p>This jacket belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald. Marina Oswald
stated that her husband owned only two jackets, one blue and the
other gray.<a id="FNanchor_C4-607" href="#Footnote_C4-607" class="fnanchor">C4-607</a> The blue jacket was found in the Texas School Book
Depository<a id="FNanchor_C4-608" href="#Footnote_C4-608" class="fnanchor">C4-608</a> and was identified by Marina Oswald as her husband’s.<a id="FNanchor_C4-609" href="#Footnote_C4-609" class="fnanchor">C4-609</a>
Marina Oswald also identified Commission Exhibit No.
162, the jacket found by Captain Westbrook, as her husband’s second
jacket.<a id="FNanchor_C4-610" href="#Footnote_C4-610" class="fnanchor">C4-610</a></p>

<p>The eyewitnesses vary in their identification of the jacket. Mrs.
Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper at Oswald’s roominghouse and the
last person known to have seen him before he reached 10th Street and
Patton Avenue, said that she may have seen the gray zipper jacket but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
she was not certain. It seemed to her that the jacket Oswald wore was
darker than Commission Exhibit No. 162.<a id="FNanchor_C4-611" href="#Footnote_C4-611" class="fnanchor">C4-611</a> Ted Callaway, who saw
the gunman moments after the shooting, testified that Commission
Exhibit No. 162 looked like the jacket he was wearing but “I thought it
had a little more tan to it.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-612" href="#Footnote_C4-612" class="fnanchor">C4-612</a> Two other witnesses, Sam Guinyard
and William Arthur Smith, testified that Commission Exhibit No. 162
was the jacket worn by the man they saw on November 22. Mrs. Markham
and Barbara Davis thought that the jacket worn by the slayer of
Tippit was darker than the jacket found by Westbrook.<a id="FNanchor_C4-613" href="#Footnote_C4-613" class="fnanchor">C4-613</a> Scoggins
thought it was lighter.<a id="FNanchor_C4-614" href="#Footnote_C4-614" class="fnanchor">C4-614</a></p>

<p>There is no doubt, however, that Oswald was seen leaving his roominghouse
at about 1 p.m. wearing a zipper jacket, that the man who
killed Tippit was wearing a light-colored jacket, that he was seen
running along Jefferson Boulevard, that a jacket was found under a
car in a lot adjoining Jefferson Boulevard, that the jacket belonged
to Lee Harvey Oswald, and that when he was arrested at approximately
1:50 p.m., he was in shirt sleeves. These facts warrant the
finding that Lee Harvey Oswald disposed of his jacket as he fled from
the scene of the Tippit killing.</p>

<h4 id="hdr88">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The foregoing evidence establishes that (1) two eyewitnesses who
heard the shots and saw the shooting of Dallas Police Patrolman J. D.
Tippit and seven eyewitnesses who saw the flight of the gunman with
revolver in hand positively identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man
they saw fire the shots or flee from the scene, (2) the cartridge cases
found near the scene of the shooting were fired from the revolver in
the possession of Oswald at the time of his arrest, to the exclusion of
all other weapons, (3) the revolver in Oswald’s possession at the time
of his arrest was purchased by and belonged to Oswald, and (4)
Oswald’s jacket was found along the path of flight taken by the gunman
as he fled from the scene of the killing. On the basis of this
evidence the Commission concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald killed
Dallas Police Patrolman J.D. Tippit.</p>

<h3 id="hdr89">OSWALD’S ARREST</h3>

<p>The Texas Theatre is on the north side of Jefferson Boulevard,
approximately eight blocks from the scene of the Tippit shooting and
six blocks from where several witnesses last saw Oswald running
west on Jefferson Boulevard.<a id="FNanchor_C4-615" href="#Footnote_C4-615" class="fnanchor">C4-615</a> (See Commission Exhibit No.
1968, <a href="#Page_164">p. 164</a>.) Shortly after the Tippit murder, police sirens sounded
along Jefferson Boulevard. One of the persons who heard the sirens
was Johnny Calvin Brewer, manager of Hardy’s Shoestore, a few
doors east of the Texas Theatre. Brewer knew from radio broadcasts
that the President had been shot and that a patrolman had also been
shot in Oak Cliff.<a id="FNanchor_C4-616" href="#Footnote_C4-616" class="fnanchor">C4-616</a> When he heard police sirens, he “looked up and
saw the man enter the lobby,” a recessed area extending about 15 feet
between the sidewalk and the front door of his store.<a id="FNanchor_C4-617" href="#Footnote_C4-617" class="fnanchor">C4-617</a> A police
car made a <b class="sans">U</b>-turn, and as the sirens grew fainter, the man in the
lobby “looked over his shoulder and turned around and walked
up West Jefferson towards the theatre.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-618" href="#Footnote_C4-618" class="fnanchor">C4-618</a> The man wore a T-shirt
beneath his outer shirt and he had no jacket.<a id="FNanchor_C4-619" href="#Footnote_C4-619" class="fnanchor">C4-619</a> Brewer said, “He
just looked funny to me. * * * His hair was sort of messed up and
looked like he had been running, and he looked scared, and he looked
funny.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span><a id="FNanchor_C4-620" href="#Footnote_C4-620" class="fnanchor">C4-620</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
Mrs. Julia Postal, selling tickets at the box office of the Texas
Theatre, heard police sirens and then saw a man as he “ducked into”
the outer lobby space of the theatre near the ticket office.<a id="FNanchor_C4-621" href="#Footnote_C4-621" class="fnanchor">C4-621</a> Attracted
by the sound of the sirens, Mrs. Postal stepped out of the box office
and walked to the curb.<a id="FNanchor_C4-622" href="#Footnote_C4-622" class="fnanchor">C4-622</a> Shortly thereafter, Johnny Brewer, who
had come from the nearby shoestore, asked Mrs. Postal whether the
fellow that had ducked in had bought a ticket.<a id="FNanchor_C4-623" href="#Footnote_C4-623" class="fnanchor">C4-623</a> She said, “No; by
golly, he didn’t,” and turned around, but the man was nowhere in
sight.<a id="FNanchor_C4-624" href="#Footnote_C4-624" class="fnanchor">C4-624</a> Brewer told Mrs. Postal that he had seen the man ducking
into his place of business and that he had followed him to the
theatre.<a id="FNanchor_C4-625" href="#Footnote_C4-625" class="fnanchor">C4-625</a> She sent Brewer into the theatre to find the man and
check the exits, told him about the assassination, and said “I don’t
know if this is the man they want * * * but he is running from them
for some reason.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-626" href="#Footnote_C4-626" class="fnanchor">C4-626</a> She then called the police.<a id="FNanchor_C4-627" href="#Footnote_C4-627" class="fnanchor">C4-627</a></p>

<p>At 1:45 p.m., the police radio stated, “Have information a suspect
just went in the Texas Theatre on West Jefferson.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-628" href="#Footnote_C4-628" class="fnanchor">C4-628</a> Patrol cars
bearing at least 15 officers converged on the Texas Theatre.<a id="FNanchor_C4-629" href="#Footnote_C4-629" class="fnanchor">C4-629</a> Patrolman
M. N. McDonald, with Patrolmen R. Hawkins, T. A. Hutson,
and C. T. Walker, entered the theatre from the rear.<a id="FNanchor_C4-630" href="#Footnote_C4-630" class="fnanchor">C4-630</a> Other policemen
entered the front door and searched the balcony.<a id="FNanchor_C4-631" href="#Footnote_C4-631" class="fnanchor">C4-631</a> Detective
Paul L. Bentley rushed to the balcony and told the projectionist to
turn up the house lights.<a id="FNanchor_C4-632" href="#Footnote_C4-632" class="fnanchor">C4-632</a> Brewer met McDonald and the other
policemen at the alley exit door, stepped out onto the stage with them<a id="FNanchor_C4-633" href="#Footnote_C4-633" class="fnanchor">C4-633</a>
and pointed out the man who had come into the theatre without paying.<a id="FNanchor_C4-634" href="#Footnote_C4-634" class="fnanchor">C4-634</a>
The man was Oswald. He was sitting alone in the rear of the
main floor of the theatre near the right center aisle.<a id="FNanchor_C4-635" href="#Footnote_C4-635" class="fnanchor">C4-635</a> About six or
seven people were seated on the theatre’s main floor and an equal
number in the balcony.<a id="FNanchor_C4-636" href="#Footnote_C4-636" class="fnanchor">C4-636</a></p>

<p>McDonald first searched two men in the center of the main floor,
about 10 rows from the front.<a id="FNanchor_C4-637" href="#Footnote_C4-637" class="fnanchor">C4-637</a> He walked out of the row up the
right center aisle.<a id="FNanchor_C4-638" href="#Footnote_C4-638" class="fnanchor">C4-638</a> When he reached the row where the suspect was
sitting, McDonald stopped abruptly and told the man to get on his
feet.<a id="FNanchor_C4-639" href="#Footnote_C4-639" class="fnanchor">C4-639</a> Oswald rose from his seat, bringing up both hands.<a id="FNanchor_C4-640" href="#Footnote_C4-640" class="fnanchor">C4-640</a> As
McDonald started to search Oswald’s waist for a gun, he heard him
say, “Well, it’s all over now.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-641" href="#Footnote_C4-641" class="fnanchor">C4-641</a> Oswald then struck McDonald
between the eyes with his left fist; with his right hand he drew a gun
from his waist.<a id="FNanchor_C4-642" href="#Footnote_C4-642" class="fnanchor">C4-642</a> McDonald struck back with his right hand and
grabbed the gun with his left hand.<a id="FNanchor_C4-643" href="#Footnote_C4-643" class="fnanchor">C4-643</a> They both fell into the seats.<a id="FNanchor_C4-644" href="#Footnote_C4-644" class="fnanchor">C4-644</a>
Three other officers, moving toward the scuffle, grabbed Oswald from
the front, rear and side.<a id="FNanchor_C4-645" href="#Footnote_C4-645" class="fnanchor">C4-645</a> As McDonald fell into the seat with his left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
hand on the gun, he felt something graze across his hand and heard
what sounded like the snap of the hammer.<a id="FNanchor_C4-646" href="#Footnote_C4-646" class="fnanchor">C4-646</a> McDonald felt the
pistol scratch his cheek as he wrenched it away from Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-647" href="#Footnote_C4-647" class="fnanchor">C4-647</a> Detective
Bob K. Carroll, who was standing beside McDonald, seized
the gun from him.<a id="FNanchor_C4-648" href="#Footnote_C4-648" class="fnanchor">C4-648</a></p>

<p>The other officers who helped subdue Oswald corroborated McDonald
in his testimony except that they did not hear Oswald say, “It’s
all over now.” Deputy Sheriff Eddy R. Walthers recalled such a
remark but he did not reach the scene of the struggle until Oswald
had been knocked to the floor by McDonald and the others.<a id="FNanchor_C4-649" href="#Footnote_C4-649" class="fnanchor">C4-649</a> Some
of the officers saw Oswald strike McDonald with his fist.<a id="FNanchor_C4-650" href="#Footnote_C4-650" class="fnanchor">C4-650</a> Most of
them heard a click which they assumed to be a click of the hammer
of the revolver.<a id="FNanchor_C4-651" href="#Footnote_C4-651" class="fnanchor">C4-651</a> Testimony of a firearms expert before the Commission
established that the hammer of the revolver never touched the
shell in the chamber.<a id="FNanchor_C4-652" href="#Footnote_C4-652" class="fnanchor">C4-652</a> Although the witnesses did not hear the
sound of a misfire, they might have heard a snapping noise resulting
from the police officer grabbing the cylinder of the revolver and pulling
it away from Oswald while he was attempting to pull the
trigger.<a id="FNanchor_C4-653" href="#Footnote_C4-653" class="fnanchor">C4-653</a> (See app. X, <a href="#Page_560">p. 560</a>.)</p>

<p>Two patrons of the theatre and John Brewer testified regarding the
arrest of Oswald, as did the various police officers who participated
in the fight. George Jefferson Applin, Jr., confirmed that Oswald
fought with four or five officers before he was handcuffed.<a id="FNanchor_C4-654" href="#Footnote_C4-654" class="fnanchor">C4-654</a> He added
that one officer grabbed the muzzle of a shotgun, drew back, and hit
Oswald with the butt end of the gun in the back.<a id="FNanchor_C4-655" href="#Footnote_C4-655" class="fnanchor">C4-655</a> No other theatre
patron or officer has testified that Oswald was hit by a gun. Nor did
Oswald ever complain that he was hit with a gun, or injured in the
back. Deputy Sheriff Walthers brought a shotgun into the theatre
but laid it on some seats before helping to subdue Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-656" href="#Footnote_C4-656" class="fnanchor">C4-656</a> Officer Ray
Hawkins said that there was no one near Oswald who had a shotgun
and he saw no one strike Oswald in the back with a rifle butt or the
butt of a gun.<a id="FNanchor_C4-657" href="#Footnote_C4-657" class="fnanchor">C4-657</a></p>

<p>John Gibson, another patron in the theatre, saw an officer grab Oswald,
and he claims that he heard the click of a gun misfiring.<a id="FNanchor_C4-658" href="#Footnote_C4-658" class="fnanchor">C4-658</a> He
saw no shotgun in the possession of any policeman near Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-659" href="#Footnote_C4-659" class="fnanchor">C4-659</a>
Johnny Brewer testified he saw Oswald pull the revolver and the
officers struggle with him to take it away but that once he was subdued,
no officer struck him.<a id="FNanchor_C4-660" href="#Footnote_C4-660" class="fnanchor">C4-660</a> He further stated that while fists were flying
he heard one of the officers say “Kill the President, will you.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-661" href="#Footnote_C4-661" class="fnanchor">C4-661</a> It
is unlikely that any of the police officers referred to Oswald as a suspect
in the assassination. While the police radio had noted the similarity
in description of the two suspects, the arresting officers were pursuing
Oswald for the murder of Tippit.<a id="FNanchor_C4-662" href="#Footnote_C4-662" class="fnanchor">C4-662</a> As Oswald, handcuffed, was
led from the theatre, he was, according to McDonald, “cursing a
little bit and hollering police brutality.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-663" href="#Footnote_C4-663" class="fnanchor">C4-663</a> At 1:51 p.m., police
car 2 reported by radio that it was on the way to headquarters with
the suspect.<a id="FNanchor_C4-664" href="#Footnote_C4-664" class="fnanchor">C4-664</a></p>

<p>Captain Fritz returned to police headquarters from the Texas
School Book Depository at 2:15 after a brief stop at the sheriff’s office.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span><a id="FNanchor_C4-665" href="#Footnote_C4-665" class="fnanchor">C4-665</a>
When he entered the homicide and robbery bureau office, he
saw two detectives standing there with Sgt. Gerald L. Hill, who had
driven from the theatre with Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-666" href="#Footnote_C4-666" class="fnanchor">C4-666</a> Hill testified that Fritz told
the detective to get a search warrant, go to an address on Fifth Street
in Irving, and pick up a man named Lee Oswald. When Hill asked
why Oswald was wanted, Fritz replied, “Well, he was employed down
at the Book Depository and he had not been present for a roll call of
the employees.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-667" href="#Footnote_C4-667" class="fnanchor">C4-667</a> Hill said, “Captain, we will save you a trip * * *
there he sits.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-668" href="#Footnote_C4-668" class="fnanchor">C4-668</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr90">STATEMENTS OF OSWALD DURING DETENTION</h3>

<p>Oswald was questioned intermittently for approximately 12 hours
between 2:30 p.m., on November 22, and 11 a.m., on November 24.
Throughout this interrogation he denied that he had anything to do
either with the assassination of President Kennedy or the murder of
Patrolman Tippit. Captain Fritz of the homicide and robbery
bureau did most of the questioning, but he kept no notes and there
were no stenographic or tape recordings. Representatives of other law
enforcement agencies were also present, including the FBI and the
U.S. Secret Service. They occasionally participated in the questioning.
The reports prepared by those present at these interviews are
set forth in appendix XI. A full discussion of Oswald’s detention
and interrogation is presented in chapter V of this report.</p>

<p>During the evening of November 22, the Dallas Police Department
performed paraffin tests on Oswald’s hands and right cheek in an
apparent effort to determine, by means of a scientific test, whether
Oswald had recently fired a weapon. The results were positive for
the hands and negative for the right cheek.<a id="FNanchor_C4-669" href="#Footnote_C4-669" class="fnanchor">C4-669</a> Expert testimony before
the Commission was to the effect that the paraffin test was unreliable<a id="FNanchor_C4-670" href="#Footnote_C4-670" class="fnanchor">C4-670</a>
in determining whether or not a person has fired a rifle or revolver.<a id="FNanchor_C4-671" href="#Footnote_C4-671" class="fnanchor">C4-671</a>
The Commission has, therefore, placed no reliance on the paraffin
tests administered by the Dallas police. (See app. X, <a href="#Page_561">pp. 561-562</a>.)</p>

<p>Oswald provided little information during his questioning. Frequently,
however, he was confronted with evidence which he could
not explain, and he resorted to statements which are known to be
lies.<a id="FNanchor_C4-672" href="#Footnote_C4-672" class="fnanchor">C4-672</a> While Oswald’s untrue statements during interrogation were
not considered items of positive proof by the Commission, they had
probative value in deciding the weight to be given to his denials that
he assassinated President Kennedy and killed Patrolman Tippit.
Since independent evidence revealed that Oswald repeatedly and
blatantly lied to the police, the Commission gave little weight to
his denials of guilt.</p>

<h4 id="hdr91">Denial of Rifle Ownership</h4>

<p>From the outset, Oswald denied owning a rifle. On November 23,
Fritz confronted Oswald with the evidence that he had purchased
a rifle under the fictitious name of “Hidell.” Oswald said that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
was not true. Oswald denied that he had a rifle wrapped up in a
blanket in the Paine garage. Oswald also denied owning a rifle and
said that since leaving the Marine Corps he had fired only a small
bore .22 rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C4-673" href="#Footnote_C4-673" class="fnanchor">C4-673</a> On the afternoon of November 23, Officers H. M.
Moore, R. S. Stovall, and G. F. Rose obtained a search warrant and
examined Oswald’s effects in the Paine garage. They discovered two
photographs, each showing Oswald with a rifle and a pistol.<a id="FNanchor_C4-674" href="#Footnote_C4-674" class="fnanchor">C4-674</a> These
photographs were shown to Oswald on the evening of November 23
and again on the morning of the 24th. According to Fritz, Oswald
sneered, saying that they were fake photographs, that he had been
photographed a number of times the day before by the police, that
they had superimposed upon the photographs a rifle and a revolver.<a id="FNanchor_C4-675" href="#Footnote_C4-675" class="fnanchor">C4-675</a>
He told Fritz a number of times that the smaller photograph was either
made from the larger, or the larger photograph was made from the
smaller and that at the proper time he would show that the pictures
were fakes. Fritz told him that the two small photographs were
found in the Paine garage. At that point, Oswald refused to answer
any further questions.<a id="FNanchor_C4-676" href="#Footnote_C4-676" class="fnanchor">C4-676</a> As previously indicated, Marina Oswald
testified that she took the two pictures with her husband’s Imperial
Reflex camera when they lived on Neely Street. Her testimony was
fully supported by a photography expert who testified that in his
opinion the pictures were not composites.<a id="FNanchor_C4-677" href="#Footnote_C4-677" class="fnanchor">C4-677</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr92">The Revolver</h4>

<p>At the first interrogation, Oswald claimed that his only crime was
carrying a gun and resisting arrest. When Captain Fritz asked him
why he carried the revolver, he answered, “Well, you know about a
pistol. I just carried it.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-678" href="#Footnote_C4-678" class="fnanchor">C4-678</a> He falsely alleged that he bought the
revolver in Fort Worth,<a id="FNanchor_C4-679" href="#Footnote_C4-679" class="fnanchor">C4-679</a> when in fact he purchased it from a mail-order
house in Los Angeles.<a id="FNanchor_C4-680" href="#Footnote_C4-680" class="fnanchor">C4-680</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr93">The Aliases “Hidell” and “O. H. Lee”</h4>

<p>The arresting officers found a forged selective service card with a
picture of Oswald and the name “Alek J. Hidell” in Oswald’s
billfold.<a id="FNanchor_C4-681" href="#Footnote_C4-681" class="fnanchor">C4-681</a> On November 22 and 23, Oswald refused to tell Fritz why
this card was in his possession,<a id="FNanchor_C4-682" href="#Footnote_C4-682" class="fnanchor">C4-682</a> or to answer any questions concerning
the card.<a id="FNanchor_C4-683" href="#Footnote_C4-683" class="fnanchor">C4-683</a> On Sunday morning, November 24, Oswald denied
that he knew A. J. Hidell. Captain Fritz produced the selective
service card bearing the name “Alek J. Hidell.” Oswald became
angry and said, “Now, I’ve told you all I’m going to tell you about that
card in my billfold—you have the card yourself and you know as much
about it as I do.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-684" href="#Footnote_C4-684" class="fnanchor">C4-684</a> At the last interrogation on November 24,
Oswald admitted to Postal Inspector Holmes that he had rented post
office box 2915, Dallas, but denied that he had received a package
in this box addressed to Hidell. He also denied that he had received
the rifle through this box.<a id="FNanchor_C4-685" href="#Footnote_C4-685" class="fnanchor">C4-685</a> Holmes reminded Oswald that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>A. J.
Hidell was listed on post office box 30061, New Orleans, as one entitled
to receive mail. Oswald replied, “I don’t know anything about
that.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-686" href="#Footnote_C4-686" class="fnanchor">C4-686</a></p>

<p>When asked why he lived at his roominghouse under the name O. H.
Lee, Oswald responded that the landlady simply made a mistake, because
he told her that his name was Lee, meaning his first name.<a id="FNanchor_C4-687" href="#Footnote_C4-687" class="fnanchor">C4-687</a> An
examination of the roominghouse register revealed that Oswald actually
signed the name O. H. Lee.<a id="FNanchor_C4-688" href="#Footnote_C4-688" class="fnanchor">C4-688</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr94">The Curtain Rod Story</h4>

<p>In concluding that Oswald was carrying a rifle in the paper bag
on the morning of November 22, 1963, the Commission found that
Oswald lied when he told Frazier that he was returning to Irving to
obtain curtain rods. When asked about the curtain rod story, Oswald
lied again. He denied that he had ever told Frazier that he wanted
a ride to Irving to get curtain rods for an apartment.<a id="FNanchor_C4-689" href="#Footnote_C4-689" class="fnanchor">C4-689</a> He explained
that a party for the Paine children had been planned for the weekend
and he preferred not to be in the Paine house at that time; therefore,
he made his weekly visit on Thursday night.<a id="FNanchor_C4-690" href="#Footnote_C4-690" class="fnanchor">C4-690</a> Actually, the party
for one of the Paine’s children was the preceding weekend, when
Marina Oswald suggested that Oswald remain in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C4-691" href="#Footnote_C4-691" class="fnanchor">C4-691</a> When
told that Frazier and Mrs. Randle had seen him carrying a long heavy
package, Oswald replied, “Well, they was mistaken. That must have
been some other time he picked me up.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-692" href="#Footnote_C4-692" class="fnanchor">C4-692</a> In one interview, he told
Fritz that the only sack he carried to work that day was a lunch sack
which he kept on his lap during the ride from Irving to Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C4-693" href="#Footnote_C4-693" class="fnanchor">C4-693</a>
Frazier testified before the Commission that Oswald carried no lunch
sack that day.<a id="FNanchor_C4-694" href="#Footnote_C4-694" class="fnanchor">C4-694</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr95">Actions During and After Shooting</h4>

<p>During the first interrogation on November 22, Fritz asked Oswald
to account for himself at the time the President was shot. Oswald
told him that he ate lunch in the first-floor lunchroom and then went
to the second floor for a Coke which he brought downstairs. He
acknowledged the encounter with the police officer on the second
floor. Oswald told Fritz that after lunch he went outside, talked with
Foreman Bill Shelley for 5 or 10 minutes and then left for home.
He said that he left work because Bill Shelley said that there would
be no more work done that day in the building.<a id="FNanchor_C4-695" href="#Footnote_C4-695" class="fnanchor">C4-695</a> Shelley denied
seeing Oswald after 12 noon or at any time after the shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C4-696" href="#Footnote_C4-696" class="fnanchor">C4-696</a> The
next day, Oswald added to his story. He stated that at the time the
President was shot he was having lunch with “Junior” but he did
not give Junior’s last name.<a id="FNanchor_C4-697" href="#Footnote_C4-697" class="fnanchor">C4-697</a> The only employee at the Depository
Building named “Junior” was James Jarman, Jr. Jarman testified
that he ate his lunch on the first floor around 5 minutes to 12, and
that he neither ate lunch with nor saw Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-698" href="#Footnote_C4-698" class="fnanchor">C4-698</a> Jarman did talk to
Oswald that morning:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * he asked me what were the people gathering around on the
corner for and I told him that the President was supposed to pass
that morning, and he asked me did I know which way he was coming,
and I told him, yes, he probably come down Main and turn
on Houston and then back again on Elm. Then he said, “Oh, I
see,” and that was all.<a id="FNanchor_C4-699" href="#Footnote_C4-699" class="fnanchor">C4-699</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At approximately 9 p.m., on April 10, 1963, in Dallas, Tex., Maj.
Gen. Edwin A. Walker, an active and controversial figure on the
American political scene since his resignation from the U.S. Army in
1961, narrowly escaped death when a rifle bullet fired from outside his
home passed near his head as he was seated at his desk.<a id="FNanchor_C4-700" href="#Footnote_C4-700" class="fnanchor">C4-700</a> There were
no eyewitnesses, although a 14-year-old boy in a neighboring house
claimed that immediately after the shooting he saw two men, in separate
cars, drive out of a church parking lot adjacent to Walker’s
home.<a id="FNanchor_C4-701" href="#Footnote_C4-701" class="fnanchor">C4-701</a> A friend of Walker’s testified that two nights before the
shooting he saw “two men around the house peeking in windows.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-702" href="#Footnote_C4-702" class="fnanchor">C4-702</a>
General Walker gave this information to the police before the shooting,
but it did not help solve the crime. Although the bullet was recovered
from Walker’s house (see app. X, <a href="#Page_562">p. 562</a>), in the absence of a
weapon it was of little investigatory value. General Walker hired
two investigators to determine whether a former employee might have
been involved in the shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C4-703" href="#Footnote_C4-703" class="fnanchor">C4-703</a> Their results were negative. Until
December 3, 1963, the Walker shooting remained unsolved.</p>

<p>The Commission evaluated the following evidence in considering
whether Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shot which almost killed General
Walker: (1) A note which Oswald left for his wife on the evening
of the shooting, (2) photographs found among Oswald’s
possessions after the assassination of President Kennedy, (3) firearm
identification of the bullet found in Walker’s home, and (4)
admissions and other statements made to Marina Oswald by Oswald
concerning the shooting.</p>

<p><i>Note left by Oswald.</i>—On December 2, 1963, Mrs. Ruth Paine
turned over to the police some of the Oswalds’ belongings, including
a Russian volume entitled “Book of Useful Advice.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-704" href="#Footnote_C4-704" class="fnanchor">C4-704</a> In this book
was an undated note written in Russian. In translation, the note
read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. This is the key to the mailbox which is located in the main
post office in the city on Ervay Street. This is the same street
where the drugstore, in which you always waited is located. You
will find the mailbox in the post office which is located 4 blocks
from the drugstore on that street. I paid for the box last month
so don’t worry about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
2. Send the information as to what has happened to me to
the Embassy and include newspaper clippings (should there be
anything about me in the newspapers). I believe that the Embassy
will come quickly to your assistance on learning everything.</p>

<p>3. I paid the house rent on the 2d so don’t worry about it.</p>

<p>4. Recently I also paid for water and gas.</p>

<p>5. The money from work will possibly be coming. The money
will be sent to our post office box. Go to the bank and cash the
check.</p>

<p>6. You can either throw out or give my clothing, etc. away.
Do not keep these. However, I prefer that you hold on to my
personal papers (military, civil, etc.).</p>

<p>7. Certain of my documents are in the small blue valise.</p>

<p>8. The address book can be found on my table in the study
should need same.</p>

<p>9. We have friends here. The Red Cross also will help you.
(Red Cross in English). [sic]</p>

<p>10. I left you as much money as I could, $60 on the second of
the month. You and the baby [apparently] can live for another
2 months using $10 per week.</p>

<p>11. If I am alive and taken prisoner, the city jail is located
at the end of the bridge through which we always passed on
going to the city (right in the beginning of the city after crossing
the bridge).<a id="FNanchor_C4-705" href="#Footnote_C4-705" class="fnanchor">C4-705</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">James C. Cadigan, FBI handwriting expert, testified that this note
was written by Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-706" href="#Footnote_C4-706" class="fnanchor">C4-706</a></p>

<p>Prior to the Walker shooting on April 10, Oswald had been attending
typing classes on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings.
He had quit these classes at least a week before the shooting, which
occurred on a Wednesday night.<a id="FNanchor_C4-707" href="#Footnote_C4-707" class="fnanchor">C4-707</a> According to Marina Oswald’s
testimony, on the night of the Walker shooting, her husband left their
apartment on Neely Street shortly after dinner. She thought he
was attending a class or was “on his own business.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-708" href="#Footnote_C4-708" class="fnanchor">C4-708</a> When he failed
to return by 10 or 10:30 p.m., Marina Oswald went to his room and
discovered the note. She testified: “When he came back I asked
him what had happened. He was very pale. I don’t remember the
exact time, but it was very late. And he told me not to ask him any
questions. He only told me he had shot at General Walker.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-709" href="#Footnote_C4-709" class="fnanchor">C4-709</a>
Oswald told his wife that he did not know whether he had hit Walker;
according to Marina Oswald when he learned on the radio and in the
newspapers the next day that he had missed, he said that he “was
very sorry that he had not hit him.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-710" href="#Footnote_C4-710" class="fnanchor">C4-710</a> Marina Oswald’s testimony
was fully supported by the note itself which appeared to be the work
of a man expecting to be killed, or imprisoned, or to disappear. The
last paragraph directed her to the jail and the other paragraphs instructed
her on the disposal of Oswald’s personal effects and the
management of her affairs if he should not return.</p>

<p>It is clear that the note was written while the Oswalds were living
in Dallas before they moved to New Orleans in the spring of 1963.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
The references to house rent and payments for water and gas indicated
that the note was written when they were living in a rented apartment;
therefore it could not have been written while Marina Oswald was
living with the Paines. Moreover, the reference in paragraph 3 to
paying “the house rent on the 2d” would be consistent with the period
when the Oswalds were living on Neely Street since the apartment
was rented on March 3, 1963. Oswald had paid the first month’s
rent in advance on March 2, 1963, and the second month’s rent was
paid on either April 2 or April 3.<a id="FNanchor_C4-711" href="#Footnote_C4-711" class="fnanchor">C4-711</a> The main post office “on Ervay
Street” refers to the post office where Oswald rented box 2915 from
October 9, 1962, to May 14, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-712" href="#Footnote_C4-712" class="fnanchor">C4-712</a> Another statement which limits
the time when it could have been written is the reference “you and
the baby,” which would indicate that it was probably written before
the birth of Oswald’s second child on October 20, 1963.</p>

<p>Oswald had apparently mistaken the county jail for the city jail.
From Neely Street the Oswalds would have traveled downtown on
the Beckley bus, across the Commerce Street viaduct and into downtown
Dallas through the Triple Underpass.<a id="FNanchor_C4-713" href="#Footnote_C4-713" class="fnanchor">C4-713</a> Either the viaduct or
the underpass might have been the “bridge” mentioned in the last
paragraph of the note. The county jail is at the corner of Houston
and Main Streets “right in the beginning of the city” after one travels
through the underpass.</p>

<p><i>Photographs.</i>—In her testimony before the Commission in February
1964, Marina Oswald stated that when Oswald returned home on
the night of the Walker shooting, he told her that he had been planning
the attempt for 2 months. He showed her a notebook 3 days later
containing photographs of General Walker’s home and a map of the
area where the house was located.<a id="FNanchor_C4-714" href="#Footnote_C4-714" class="fnanchor">C4-714</a> Although Oswald destroyed
the notebook,<a id="FNanchor_C4-715" href="#Footnote_C4-715" class="fnanchor">C4-715</a> three photographs found among Oswald’s possessions
after the assassination were identified by Marina Oswald as photographs
of General Walker’s house.<a id="FNanchor_C4-716" href="#Footnote_C4-716" class="fnanchor">C4-716</a> Two of these photographs were
taken from the rear of Walker’s house.<a id="FNanchor_C4-717" href="#Footnote_C4-717" class="fnanchor">C4-717</a> The Commission confirmed,
by comparison with other photographs, that these were, indeed,
photographs of the rear of Walker’s house.<a id="FNanchor_C4-718" href="#Footnote_C4-718" class="fnanchor">C4-718</a> An examination of the
window at the rear of the house, the wall through which the bullet
passed, and the fence behind the house indicated that the bullet was
fired from a position near the point where one of the photographs was
taken.<a id="FNanchor_C4-719" href="#Footnote_C4-719" class="fnanchor">C4-719</a></p>

<p>The third photograph identified by Marina Oswald depicts the
entrance to General Walker’s driveway from a back alley.<a id="FNanchor_C4-720" href="#Footnote_C4-720" class="fnanchor">C4-720</a> Also
seen in the picture is the fence on which Walker’s assailant apparently
rested the rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C4-721" href="#Footnote_C4-721" class="fnanchor">C4-721</a> An examination of certain construction work appearing
in the background of this photograph revealed that the picture
was taken between March 8 and 12, 1963, and most probably on either
March 9 or March 10.<a id="FNanchor_C4-722" href="#Footnote_C4-722" class="fnanchor">C4-722</a> Oswald purchased the money order for the
rifle on March 12, the rifle was shipped on March 20,<a id="FNanchor_C4-723" href="#Footnote_C4-723" class="fnanchor">C4-723</a> and the shooting
occurred on April 10. A photography expert with the FBI was
able to determine that this picture was taken with the Imperial Reflex
camera owned by Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C4-724" href="#Footnote_C4-724" class="fnanchor">C4-724</a> (See app. X, <a href="#Page_596">p. 596</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
A fourth photograph, showing a stretch of railroad tracks, was also
identified by Marina Oswald as having been taken by her husband,
presumably in connection with the Walker shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C4-725" href="#Footnote_C4-725" class="fnanchor">C4-725</a> Investigation
determined that this photograph was taken approximately seven-tenths
of a mile from Walker’s house.<a id="FNanchor_C4-726" href="#Footnote_C4-726" class="fnanchor">C4-726</a> Another photograph of railroad
tracks found among Oswald’s possessions was not identified by
his wife, but investigation revealed that it was taken from a point
slightly less than half a mile from General Walker’s house.<a id="FNanchor_C4-727" href="#Footnote_C4-727" class="fnanchor">C4-727</a> Marina
Oswald stated that when she asked her husband what he had done with
the rifle, he replied that he had buried it in the ground or hidden it in
some bushes and that he also mentioned a railroad track in this connection.
She testified that several days later Oswald recovered his
rifle and brought it back to their apartment.<a id="FNanchor_C4-728" href="#Footnote_C4-728" class="fnanchor">C4-728</a></p>

<p><i>Firearms identification.</i>—In the room beyond the one in which General
Walker was sitting on the night of the shooting the Dallas police
recovered a badly mutilated bullet which had come to rest on a stack
of paper.<a id="FNanchor_C4-729" href="#Footnote_C4-729" class="fnanchor">C4-729</a> The Dallas City-County Investigation Laboratory tried
to determine the type of weapon which fired the bullet. The oral report
was negative because of the battered condition of the bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C4-730" href="#Footnote_C4-730" class="fnanchor">C4-730</a>
On November 30, 1963, the FBI requested the bullet for ballistics examination;
the Dallas Police Department forwarded it on December 2,
1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-731" href="#Footnote_C4-731" class="fnanchor">C4-731</a></p>

<p>Robert A. Frazier, an FBI ballistics identification expert, testified
that he was “unable to reach a conclusion” as to whether or not the bullet
recovered from Walker’s house had been fired from the rifle found
on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building. He
concluded that “the general rifling characteristics of the rifle * * *
are of the same type as those found on the bullet * * * and, further,
on this basis * * * the bullet could have been fired from the rifle on
the basis of its land and groove impressions.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-732" href="#Footnote_C4-732" class="fnanchor">C4-732</a> Frazier testified
further that the FBI avoids the category of “probable” identification.
Unless the missile or cartridge case can be identified as coming from a
particular weapon to the exclusion of all others, the FBI refuses to
draw any conclusion as to probability.<a id="FNanchor_C4-733" href="#Footnote_C4-733" class="fnanchor">C4-733</a> Frazier testified, however,
that he found no microscopic characteristics or other evidence which
would indicate that the bullet was not fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle owned by Lee Harvey Oswald. It was a 6.5-millimeter
bullet and, according to Frazier, “relatively few” types of rifles could
produce the characteristics found on the bullet.<a id="FNanchor_C4-734" href="#Footnote_C4-734" class="fnanchor">C4-734</a></p>

<p>Joseph D. Nicol, superintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Criminal
Identification and Investigation, conducted an independent examination
of this bullet and concluded “that there is a fair probability”
that the bullet was fired from the rifle used in the assassination of President
Kennedy.<a id="FNanchor_C4-735" href="#Footnote_C4-735" class="fnanchor">C4-735</a> In explaining the difference between his policy and
that of the FBI on the matter of probable identification, Nicol said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am aware of their position. This is not, I am sure, arrived at
without careful consideration. However, to say that because one
does not find sufficient marks for identification that it is a negative,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
I think is going overboard in the other direction. And for purposes
of probative value, for whatever it might be worth, in the
absence of very definite negative evidence, I think it is permissible
to say that in an exhibit such as 573 there is enough on it to say
that it could have come, and even perhaps a little stronger, to
say that it probably came from this, without going so far as to
say to the exclusion of all other guns. This I could not do.<a id="FNanchor_C4-736" href="#Footnote_C4-736" class="fnanchor">C4-736</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Although the Commission recognizes that neither expert was able
to state that the bullet which missed General Walker was fired from
Oswald’s rifle to the exclusion of all others, this testimony was considered
probative when combined with the other testimony linking
Oswald to the shooting.</p>

<p><i>Additional corroborative evidence.</i>—The admissions made to Marina
Oswald by her husband are an important element in the evidence that
Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shot at General Walker. As shown above,
the note and the photographs of Walker’s house and of the nearby
railroad tracks provide important corroboration for her account of the
incident. Other details described by Marina Oswald coincide with
facts developed independently of her statements. She testified that her
husband had postponed his attempt to kill Walker until that Wednesday
because he had heard that there was to be a gathering at the church
next door to Walker’s house on that evening. He indicated that he
wanted more people in the vicinity at the time of the attempt so that
his arrival and departure would not attract great attention.<a id="FNanchor_C4-737" href="#Footnote_C4-737" class="fnanchor">C4-737</a> An official
of this church told FBI agents that services are held every
Wednesday at the church except during the month of August.<a id="FNanchor_C4-738" href="#Footnote_C4-738" class="fnanchor">C4-738</a>
Marina Oswald also testified that her husband had used a bus to return
home.<a id="FNanchor_C4-739" href="#Footnote_C4-739" class="fnanchor">C4-739</a> A study of the bus routes indicates that Oswald could have
taken any one of several different buses to Walker’s house or to a point
near the railroad tracks where he may have concealed the rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C4-740" href="#Footnote_C4-740" class="fnanchor">C4-740</a> It
would have been possible for him to take different routes in approaching
and leaving the scene of the shooting.</p>

<p><i>Conclusion.</i>—Based on (1) the contents of the note which Oswald
left for his wife on April 10, 1963, (2) the photographs found among
Oswald’s possessions, (3) the testimony of firearms identification
experts, and (4) the testimony of Marina Oswald, the Commission
has concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald attempted to take the life
of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker (Resigned, U.S. Army) on April 10,
1963. The finding that Lee Harvey Oswald attempted to murder
a public figure in April 1963 was considered of probative value in
this investigation, although the Commission’s conclusion concerning
the identity of the assassin was based on evidence independent of the
finding that Oswald attempted to kill General Walker.</p>

<h4 id="hdr98">Richard M. Nixon Incident</h4>

<p>Another alleged threat by Oswald against a public figure involved
former Vice President Richard M. Nixon. In January 1964, Marina
Oswald and her business manager, James Martin, told Robert Oswald,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
Lee Harvey Oswald’s brother, that Oswald had once threatened to
shoot former Vice President Richard M. Nixon.<a id="FNanchor_C4-741" href="#Footnote_C4-741" class="fnanchor">C4-741</a> When Marina Oswald
testified before the Commission on February 3-6, 1964, she had
failed to mention the incident when she was asked whether Oswald had
ever expressed any hostility toward any official of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_C4-742" href="#Footnote_C4-742" class="fnanchor">C4-742</a>
The Commission first learned of this incident when Robert Oswald
related it to FBI agents on February 19, 1964,<a id="FNanchor_C4-743" href="#Footnote_C4-743" class="fnanchor">C4-743</a> and to the Commission
on February 21.<a id="FNanchor_C4-744" href="#Footnote_C4-744" class="fnanchor">C4-744</a></p>

<p>Marina Oswald appeared before the Commission again on June 11,
1964, and testified that a few days before her husband’s departure
from Dallas to New Orleans on April 24, 1963, he finished reading a
morning newspaper “* * * and put on a good suit. I saw that he
took a pistol. I asked him where he was going, and why he was getting
dressed. He answered ‘Nixon is coming. I want to go and have
a look.’” He also said that he would use the pistol if the opportunity
arose.<a id="FNanchor_C4-745" href="#Footnote_C4-745" class="fnanchor">C4-745</a> She reminded him that after the Walker shooting he had
promised never to repeat such an act. Marina Oswald related the
events which followed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I called him into the bathroom and I closed the door and I wanted
to prevent him and then I started to cry. And I told him that
he shouldn’t do this, and that he had promised me.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I remember that I held him. We actually struggled for several
minutes and then he quieted down.<a id="FNanchor_C4-746" href="#Footnote_C4-746" class="fnanchor">C4-746</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">She stated that it was not physical force which kept him from leaving
the house. “I couldn’t keep him from going out if he really wanted
to.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-747" href="#Footnote_C4-747" class="fnanchor">C4-747</a> After further questioning she stated that she might have
been confused about shutting him in the bathroom, but that “there
is no doubt that he got dressed and got a gun.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-748" href="#Footnote_C4-748" class="fnanchor">C4-748</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s revolver was shipped from Los Angeles on March 20,
1963,<a id="FNanchor_C4-749" href="#Footnote_C4-749" class="fnanchor">C4-749</a> and he left for New Orleans on April 24, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-750" href="#Footnote_C4-750" class="fnanchor">C4-750</a> No edition
of either Dallas newspaper during the period January 1, 1963, to
May 15, 1963, mentioned any proposed visit by Mr. Nixon to Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C4-751" href="#Footnote_C4-751" class="fnanchor">C4-751</a>
Mr. Nixon advised the Commission that the only time he was in
Dallas in 1963 was on November 20-21, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C4-752" href="#Footnote_C4-752" class="fnanchor">C4-752</a> An investigation
failed to reveal any invitation extended to Mr. Nixon during the
period when Oswald’s threat reportedly occurred.<a id="FNanchor_C4-753" href="#Footnote_C4-753" class="fnanchor">C4-753</a> The Commission
has concluded, therefore, that regardless of what Oswald may
have said to his wife he was not actually planning to shoot Mr. Nixon
at that time in Dallas.</p>

<p>On April 23, 1963, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was in Dallas
for a visit which had been publicized in the Dallas newspapers
throughout April.<a id="FNanchor_C4-754" href="#Footnote_C4-754" class="fnanchor">C4-754</a> The Commission asked Marina Oswald whether
she might have misunderstood the object of her husband’s threat.
She stated, “there is no question that in this incident it was a question
of Mr. Nixon.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-755" href="#Footnote_C4-755" class="fnanchor">C4-755</a> When asked later whether it might have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
Mr. Johnson, she said, “Yes, no. I am getting a little confused with
so many questions. I was absolutely convinced it was Nixon and
now after all these questions I wonder if I am right in my mind.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-756" href="#Footnote_C4-756" class="fnanchor">C4-756</a>
She stated further that Oswald had only mentioned Nixon’s name
once during the incident.<a id="FNanchor_C4-757" href="#Footnote_C4-757" class="fnanchor">C4-757</a> Marina Oswald might have misunderstood
her husband. Mr. Johnson was the then Vice President and his visit
took place on April 23d.<a id="FNanchor_C4-758" href="#Footnote_C4-758" class="fnanchor">C4-758</a> This was 1 day before Oswald left for
New Orleans and Marina appeared certain that the Nixon incident
“wasn’t the day before. Perhaps 3 days before.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-759" href="#Footnote_C4-759" class="fnanchor">C4-759</a></p>

<p>Marina Oswald speculated that the incident may have been unrelated
to an actual threat. She said,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * It might have been that he was just trying to test me. He
was the kind of person who could try and wound somebody in that
way. Possibly he didn’t want to go out at all but was just
doing this all as a sort of joke, not really as a joke but rather
to simply wound me, to make me feel bad.<a id="FNanchor_C4-760" href="#Footnote_C4-760" class="fnanchor">C4-760</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the absence of other evidence that Oswald actually intended to
shoot someone at this time, the Commission concluded that the incident,
as described by Marina Oswald, was of no probative value in the
Commission’s decision concerning the identity of the assassin of President
Kennedy.</p>

<h3 id="hdr99">OSWALD’S RIFLE CAPABILITY</h3>

<p>In deciding whether Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots which
killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally, the
Commission considered whether Oswald, using his own rifle, possessed
the capability to hit his target with two out of three shots under the
conditions described in chapter III. The Commission evaluated (1)
the nature of the shots, (2) Oswald’s Marine training in marksmanship,
(3) his experience and practice after leaving the Marine Corps,
and (4) the accuracy of the weapon and the quality of the ammunition.</p>

<h4 id="hdr100">The Nature of the Shots</h4>

<p>For a rifleman situated on the sixth floor of the Texas School
Book Depository Building the shots were at a slow-moving target
proceeding on a downgrade in virtually a straight line with the alinement
of the assassin’s rifle, at a range of 177 to 266 feet.<a id="FNanchor_C4-761" href="#Footnote_C4-761" class="fnanchor">C4-761</a> An aerial
photograph of Dealey Plaza shows that Elm Street runs at an angle
so that the President would have been moving in an almost straight
line away from the assassin’s rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C4-762" href="#Footnote_C4-762" class="fnanchor">C4-762</a> (See Commission Exhibit No.
876, <a href="#Page_33">p. 33</a>.) In addition, the 3° downward slope of Elm Street was of
assistance in eliminating at least some of the adjustment which is ordinarily
required when a marksman must raise his rifle as a target

<p>Four marksmanship experts testified before the Commission. Maj.
Eugene D. Anderson, assistant head of the Marksmanship Branch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
the U.S. Marine Corps, testified that the shots which struck the President
in the neck and in the head were “not * * * particularly difficult.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-764" href="#Footnote_C4-764" class="fnanchor">C4-764</a>
Robert A. Frazier, FBI expert in firearms identification
and training, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From my own experience in shooting over the years, when you
shoot at 175 feet or 260 feet, which is less than 100 yards, with
a telescopic sight, you should not have any difficulty in hitting
your target.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I mean it requires no training at all to shoot a weapon with a
telescopic sight once you know that you must put the crosshairs
on the target and that is all that is necessary.<a id="FNanchor_C4-765" href="#Footnote_C4-765" class="fnanchor">C4-765</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Ronald Simmons, chief of the U.S. Army Infantry Weapons Evaluation
Branch of the Ballistics Research Laboratory, said: “Well, in
order to achieve three hits, it would not be required that a man be an
exceptional shot. A proficient man with this weapon, yes.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-766" href="#Footnote_C4-766" class="fnanchor">C4-766</a></p>

<p>The effect of a four-power telescopic sight on the difficulty of these
shots was considered in detail by M. Sgt. James A. Zahm, noncommissioned
officer in charge of the Marksmanship Training Unit in the
Weapons Training Battalion of the Marine Corps School at Quantico,
Va.<a id="FNanchor_C4-767" href="#Footnote_C4-767" class="fnanchor">C4-767</a> Referring to a rifle with a four-power telescope, Sergeant
Zahm said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * this is the ideal type of weapon for moving targets * * *<a id="FNanchor_C4-768" href="#Footnote_C4-768" class="fnanchor">C4-768</a></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>* * * Using the scope, rapidly working a bolt and using the scope
to relocate your target quickly and at the same time when you
locate that target you identify it and the crosshairs are in close
relationship to the point you want to shoot at, it just takes a
minor move in aiming to bring the crosshairs to bear, and then
it is a quick squeeze.<a id="FNanchor_C4-769" href="#Footnote_C4-769" class="fnanchor">C4-769</a></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I consider it a real advantage, particularly at the range of 100
yards, in identifying your target. It allows you to see your
target clearly, and it is still of a minimum amount of power that
it doesn’t exaggerate your own body movements. It just is an
aid in seeing in the fact that you only have the one element, the
crosshair, in relation to the target as opposed to iron sights with
aligning the sights and then aligning them on the target.<a id="FNanchor_C4-770" href="#Footnote_C4-770" class="fnanchor">C4-770</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Characterizing the four-power scope as “a real aid, an extreme aid”
in rapid fire shooting, Sergeant Zahm expressed the opinion that the
shot which struck President Kennedy in the neck at 176.9 to 190.8
feet was “very easy” and the shot which struck the President in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
head at a distance of 265.3 feet was “an easy shot.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-771" href="#Footnote_C4-771" class="fnanchor">C4-771</a> After viewing
photographs depicting the alinement of Elm Street in relation to the
Texas School Book Depository Building, Zahm stated further:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is a definite advantage to the shooter, the vehicle moving
directly away from him and the downgrade of the street, and he
being in an elevated position made an almost stationary target
while he was aiming in, very little movement if any.<a id="FNanchor_C4-772" href="#Footnote_C4-772" class="fnanchor">C4-772</a></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="hdr101">Oswald’s Marine Training</h4>

<p>In accordance with standard Marine procedures, Oswald received
extensive training in marksmanship.<a id="FNanchor_C4-773" href="#Footnote_C4-773" class="fnanchor">C4-773</a> During the first week of an
intensive 3-week training period he received instruction in sighting,
aiming, and manipulation of the trigger.<a id="FNanchor_C4-774" href="#Footnote_C4-774" class="fnanchor">C4-774</a> He went through a series
of exercises called dry firing where he assumed all positions which
would later be used in the qualification course.<a id="FNanchor_C4-775" href="#Footnote_C4-775" class="fnanchor">C4-775</a> After familiarization
with live ammunition in the .22 rifle and .22 pistol, Oswald, like
all Marine recruits, received training on the rifle range at distances
up to 500 yards, firing 50 rounds each day for five days.<a id="FNanchor_C4-776" href="#Footnote_C4-776" class="fnanchor">C4-776</a></p>

<p>Following that training, Oswald was tested in December of 1956,
and obtained a score of 212, which was 2 points above the minimum for
qualifications as a “sharpshooter” in a scale of marksman—sharpshooter—expert.<a id="FNanchor_C4-777" href="#Footnote_C4-777" class="fnanchor">C4-777</a>
In May of 1959, on another range, Oswald scored
191, which was 1 point over the minimum for ranking as a “marksman.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-778" href="#Footnote_C4-778" class="fnanchor">C4-778</a>
The Marine Corps records maintained on Oswald further
show that he had fired and was familiar with the Browning Automatic
rifle, .45 caliber pistol, and 12-gage riot gun.<a id="FNanchor_C4-779" href="#Footnote_C4-779" class="fnanchor">C4-779</a></p>

<p>Based on the general Marine Corps ratings, Lt. Col. A. G. Folsom,
Jr., head, Records Branch, Personnel Department, Headquarters U.S.
Marine Corps, evaluated the sharpshooter qualification as a “fairly
good shot” and a low marksman rating as a “rather poor shot.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-780" href="#Footnote_C4-780" class="fnanchor">C4-780</a></p>

<p>When asked to explain the different scores achieved by Oswald on
the two occasions when he fired for record, Major Anderson said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * when he fired that [212] he had just completed a very intensive
preliminary training period. He had the services of
an experienced highly trained coach. He had high motivation.
He had presumably a good to excellent rifle and good ammunition.
We have nothing here to show under what conditions the B course
was fired. It might well have been a bad day for firing the rifle—windy,
rainy, dark. There is little probability that he had a good,
expert coach, and he probably didn’t have as high a motivation
because he was no longer in recruit training and under the care
of the drill instructor. There is some possibility that the rifle
he was firing might not have been as good a rifle as the rifle that
he was firing in his A course firing, because [he] may well have
carried this rifle for quite some time, and it got banged around
in normal usage.<a id="FNanchor_C4-781" href="#Footnote_C4-781" class="fnanchor">C4-781</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
Major Anderson concluded:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I would say that as compared to other Marines receiving the
same type of training, that Oswald was a good shot, somewhat
better than or equal to—better than the average let us say. As
compared to a civilian who had not received this intensive training,
he would be considered as a good to excellent shot.<a id="FNanchor_C4-782" href="#Footnote_C4-782" class="fnanchor">C4-782</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When Sergeant Zahm was asked whether Oswald’s Marine Corps
training would have made it easier to operate a rifle with a four-power
scope, he replied:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Based on that training, his basic knowledge in sight manipulation
and trigger squeeze and what not, I would say that he would
be capable of sighting that rifle in well, firing it, with 10
rounds.<a id="FNanchor_C4-783" href="#Footnote_C4-783" class="fnanchor">C4-783</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">After reviewing Oswald’s marksmanship scores, Sergeant Zahm
concluded:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I would say in the Marine Corps he is a good shot, slightly
above average, and as compared to the average male of his age
throughout the civilian, throughout the United States, that he is
an excellent shot.<a id="FNanchor_C4-784" href="#Footnote_C4-784" class="fnanchor">C4-784</a></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="hdr102">Oswald’s Rifle Practice Outside the Marines</h4>

<p>During one of his leaves from the Marines, Oswald hunted with
his brother Robert, using a .22 caliber bolt-action rifle belonging either
to Robert or Robert’s in-laws.<a id="FNanchor_C4-785" href="#Footnote_C4-785" class="fnanchor">C4-785</a> After he left the Marines and before
departing for Russia, Oswald, his brother, and a third companion went
hunting for squirrels and rabbits.<a id="FNanchor_C4-786" href="#Footnote_C4-786" class="fnanchor">C4-786</a> On that occasion Oswald again
used a bolt-action .22 caliber rifle; and according to Robert, Lee
Oswald exhibited an average amount of proficiency with that
weapon.<a id="FNanchor_C4-787" href="#Footnote_C4-787" class="fnanchor">C4-787</a> While in Russia, Oswald obtained a hunting license,
joined a hunting club and went hunting about six times, as discussed
more fully in chapter VI.<a id="FNanchor_C4-788" href="#Footnote_C4-788" class="fnanchor">C4-788</a> Soon after Oswald returned from
the Soviet Union he again went hunting with his brother, Robert,
and used a borrowed .22 caliber bolt-action rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C4-789" href="#Footnote_C4-789" class="fnanchor">C4-789</a> After Oswald
purchased the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, he told his wife that he practiced
with it.<a id="FNanchor_C4-790" href="#Footnote_C4-790" class="fnanchor">C4-790</a> Marina Oswald testified that on one occasion she
saw him take the rifle, concealed in a raincoat, from the house on Neely
Street. Oswald told her he was going to practice with it.<a id="FNanchor_C4-791" href="#Footnote_C4-791" class="fnanchor">C4-791</a> According
to George De Mohrenschildt, Oswald said that he went target
shooting with that rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C4-792" href="#Footnote_C4-792" class="fnanchor">C4-792</a></p>

<p>Marina Oswald testified that in New Orleans in May of 1963, she
observed Oswald sitting with the rifle on their screened porch at night,
sighting with the telescopic lens and operating the bolt.<a id="FNanchor_C4-793" href="#Footnote_C4-793" class="fnanchor">C4-793</a> Examination
of the cartridge cases found on the sixth floor of the Depository<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
Building established that they had been previously loaded and ejected
from the assassination rifle, which would indicate that Oswald practiced
operating the bolt.<a id="FNanchor_C4-794" href="#Footnote_C4-794" class="fnanchor">C4-794</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr103">Accuracy of Weapon</h4>

<p>It will be recalled from the discussion in chapter III that the
assassin in all probability hit two out of the three shots during the
maximum time span of 4.8 to 5.6 seconds if the second shot missed, or,
if either the first or third shots missed, the assassin fired the three
shots during a minimum time span of 7.1 to 7.9 seconds.<a id="FNanchor_C4-795" href="#Footnote_C4-795" class="fnanchor">C4-795</a> A series
of tests were performed to determine whether the weapon and ammunition
used in the assassination were capable of firing the shots which
were fired by the assassin on November 22, 1963. The ammunition
used by the assassin was manufactured by Western Cartridge Co. of
East Alton, Ill. In tests with the Mannlicher-Carcano C2766 rifle,
over 100 rounds of this ammunition were fired by the FBI and the
Infantry Weapons Evaluation Branch of the U.S. Army. There were
no misfires.<a id="FNanchor_C4-796" href="#Footnote_C4-796" class="fnanchor">C4-796</a></p>

<p>In an effort to test the rifle under conditions which simulated those
which prevailed during the assassination, the Infantry Weapons
Evaluation Branch of the Ballistics Research Laboratory had expert
riflemen fire the assassination weapon from a tower at three silhouette
targets at distances of 175, 240, and 265 feet. The target at 265 feet
was placed to the right of the 240-foot target which was in turn placed
to the right of the closest silhouette.<a id="FNanchor_C4-797" href="#Footnote_C4-797" class="fnanchor">C4-797</a> Using the assassination rifle
mounted with the telescopic sight, three marksmen, rated as master
by the National Rifle Association, each fired two series of three shots.
In the first series the firers required time spans of 4.6, 6.75, and 8.25
seconds respectively. On the second series they required 5.15, 6.45,
and 7 seconds. None of the marksmen had any practice with the
assassination weapon except for exercising the bolt for 2 or 3 minutes
on a dry run. They had not even pulled the trigger because of concern
about breaking the firing pin.<a id="FNanchor_C4-798" href="#Footnote_C4-798" class="fnanchor">C4-798</a></p>

<p>The marksmen took as much time as they wanted for the first target
and all hit the target.<a id="FNanchor_C4-799" href="#Footnote_C4-799" class="fnanchor">C4-799</a> For the first four attempts, the firers missed
the second shot by several inches.<a id="FNanchor_C4-800" href="#Footnote_C4-800" class="fnanchor">C4-800</a> The angle from the first to the
second shot was greater than from the second to the third shot and
required a movement in the basic firing position of the marksmen.<a id="FNanchor_C4-801" href="#Footnote_C4-801" class="fnanchor">C4-801</a>
This angle was used in the test because the majority of the eyewitnesses
to the assassination stated that there was a shorter interval between
shots two and three than between shots one and two.<a id="FNanchor_C4-802" href="#Footnote_C4-802" class="fnanchor">C4-802</a> As has been
shown in chapter III, if the three shots were fired within a period of
from 4.8 to 5.6 seconds, the shots would have been evenly spaced and
the assassin would not have incurred so sharp an angular movement.<a id="FNanchor_C4-803" href="#Footnote_C4-803" class="fnanchor">C4-803</a></p>

<p>Five of the six shots hit the third target where the angle of movement
of the weapon was small.<a id="FNanchor_C4-804" href="#Footnote_C4-804" class="fnanchor">C4-804</a> On the basis of these results, Simmons
testified that in his opinion the probability of hitting the targets
at the relatively short range at which they were hit was very high.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span><a id="FNanchor_C4-805" href="#Footnote_C4-805" class="fnanchor">C4-805</a>
Considering the various probabilities which may have prevailed during
the actual assassination, the highest level of firing performance which
would have been required of the assassin and the C2766 rifle would
have been to fire three times and hit the target twice within a span
of 4.8 to 5.6 seconds. In fact, one of the firers in the rapid fire test
in firing his two series of three shots, hit the target twice within a span
of 4.6 and 5.15 seconds. The others would have been able to reduce
their times if they had been given the opportunity to become familiar
with the movement of the bolt and the trigger pull.<a id="FNanchor_C4-806" href="#Footnote_C4-806" class="fnanchor">C4-806</a> Simmons testified
that familiarity with the bolt could be achieved in dry practice
and, as has been indicated above, Oswald engaged in such practice.<a id="FNanchor_C4-807" href="#Footnote_C4-807" class="fnanchor">C4-807</a>
If the assassin missed either the first or third shot, he had a total of between
4.8 and 5.6 seconds between the two shots which hit and a total
minimum time period of from 7.1 to 7.9 seconds for all three shots. All
three of the firers in these tests were able to fire the rounds within the
time period which would have been available to the assassin under
those conditions.</p>

<p>Three FBI firearms experts tested the rifle in order to determine
the speed with which it could be fired. The purpose of this experiment
was not to test the rifle under conditions which prevailed
at the time of the assassination but to determine the maximum speed
at which it could be fired. The three FBI experts each fired three
shots from the weapon at 15 yards in 6, 7, and 9 seconds, and one of
these agents, Robert A. Frazier, fired two series of three shots at 25
yards in 4.6 and 4.8 seconds.<a id="FNanchor_C4-808" href="#Footnote_C4-808" class="fnanchor">C4-808</a> At 15 yards each man’s shots landed
within the size of a dime.<a id="FNanchor_C4-809" href="#Footnote_C4-809" class="fnanchor">C4-809</a> The shots fired by Frazier at the range of
25 yards landed within an area of 2 inches and 5 inches respectively.<a id="FNanchor_C4-810" href="#Footnote_C4-810" class="fnanchor">C4-810</a>
Frazier later fired four groups of three shots at a distance of 100 yards
in 5.9, 6.2, 5.6, and 6.5 seconds. Each series of three shots landed within
areas ranging in diameter from 3 to 5 inches.<a id="FNanchor_C4-811" href="#Footnote_C4-811" class="fnanchor">C4-811</a> Although all of the
shots were a few inches high and to the right of the target, this was
because of a defect in the scope which was recognized by the FBI
agents and which they could have compensated for if they were aiming
to hit a bull’s-eye.<a id="FNanchor_C4-812" href="#Footnote_C4-812" class="fnanchor">C4-812</a> They were instead firing to determine how rapidly
the weapon could be fired and the area within which three shots
could be placed. Frazier testified that while he could not tell when
the defect occurred, but that a person familiar with the weapon could
compensate for it.<a id="FNanchor_C4-813" href="#Footnote_C4-813" class="fnanchor">C4-813</a> Moreover, the defect was one which would have
assisted the assassin aiming at a target which was moving away.
Frazier said, “The fact that the crosshairs are set high would actually
compensate for any lead which had to be taken. So that if you aimed
with this weapon as it actually was received at the laboratory, it
would not be necessary to take any lead whatsoever in order to hit
the intended object. The scope would accomplish the lead for you.”
Frazier added that the scope would cause a slight miss to the right. It
should be noted, however, that the President’s car was curving slightly
to the right when the third shot was fired.</p>

<p>Based on these tests the experts agreed that the assassination rifle
was an accurate weapon. Simmons described it as “quite accurate,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
in fact, as accurate as current military rifles.<a id="FNanchor_C4-814" href="#Footnote_C4-814" class="fnanchor">C4-814</a> Frazier testified that
the rifle was accurate, that it had less recoil than the average military
rifle and that one would not have to be an expert marksman to have
accomplished the assassination with the weapon which was used.<a id="FNanchor_C4-815" href="#Footnote_C4-815" class="fnanchor">C4-815</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr104">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The various tests showed that the Mannlicher-Carcano was an accurate
rifle and that the use of a four-power scope was a substantial
aid to rapid, accurate firing. Oswald’s Marine training in marksmanship,
his other rifle experience and his established familiarity with
this particular weapon show that he possessed ample capability to
commit the assassination. Based on the known facts of the assassination,
the Marine marksmanship experts, Major Anderson and Sergeant
Zahm, concurred in the opinion that Oswald had the capability to fire
three shots, with two hits, within 4.8 and 5.6 seconds.<a id="FNanchor_C4-816" href="#Footnote_C4-816" class="fnanchor">C4-816</a> Concerning
the shots which struck the President in the back of the neck, Sergeant
Zahm testified: “With the equipment he [Oswald] had and with his
ability I consider it a very easy shot.”<a id="FNanchor_C4-817" href="#Footnote_C4-817" class="fnanchor">C4-817</a> Having fired this shot the
assassin was then required to hit the target one more time within
a space of from 4.8 to 5.6 seconds. On the basis of Oswald’s training
and the accuracy of the weapon as established by the tests, the Commission
concluded that Oswald was capable of accomplishing this
second hit even if there was an intervening shot which missed. The
probability of hitting the President a second time would have been
markedly increased if, in fact, he had missed either the first or third
shots thereby leaving a time span of 4.8 to 5.6 seconds between the
two shots which struck their mark. The Commission agrees with the
testimony of Marine marksmanship expert Zahm that it was “an
easy shot” to hit some part of the President’s body, and that the range
where the rifleman would be expected to hit would include the
President’s head.<a id="FNanchor_C4-818" href="#Footnote_C4-818" class="fnanchor">C4-818</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr105">CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>On the basis of the evidence reviewed in this chapter, the Commission
has found that Lee Harvey Oswald (1) owned and possessed the
rifle used to kill President Kennedy and wound Governor Connally,
(2) brought this rifle into the Depository Building on the morning of
the assassination, (3) was present, at the time of the assassination, at
the window from which the shots were fired, (4) killed Dallas Police
Officer J. D. Tippit in an apparent attempt to escape, (5) resisted arrest
by drawing a fully loaded pistol and attempting to shoot another
police officer, (6) lied to the police after his arrest concerning important
substantive matters, (7) attempted, in April 1963, to kill Maj.
Gen. Edwin A. Walker, and (8) possessed the capability with a rifle
which would have enabled him to commit the assassination. On the
basis of these findings the Commission has concluded that Lee Harvey
Oswald was the assassin of President Kennedy.</p>

<span class="subhead">Detention and Death of Oswald</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Lee Harvey Oswald</span> spent almost all of the last 48 hours
of his life in the Police and Courts Building, a gray stone
structure in downtown Dallas that housed the headquarters
of the Dallas Police Department and the city jail. Following his
arrest early Friday afternoon, Oswald was brought immediately to
this building and remained there until Sunday morning, November 24,
when he was scheduled to be transferred to the county jail. At 11:21
that morning, in full view of millions of people watching on television,
Oswald was fatally wounded by Jack Ruby, who emerged suddenly
from the crowd of newsmen and policemen witnessing the transfer
and fired a single shot at Oswald.</p>

<p>Whether the killing of Oswald was part of a conspiracy involving
the assassination of President Kennedy is considered in chapter VI.
Aside from that question, the occurrences within the Police and Courts
Building between November 22 and 24 raise other important issues
concerning the conduct of law enforcement officials, the responsibilities
of the press, the rights of accused persons, and the administration
of criminal justice in the United States. The Commission has therefore
deemed it necessary to determine the facts concerning Oswald’s
detention and death and to evaluate the actions and responsibilities
of the police and press involved in these events.</p>

<h3 id="hdr107">TREATMENT OF OSWALD IN CUSTODY</h3>

<p>The focal center of the Police and Courts Building during Oswald’s
detention was the third floor, which housed the main offices of the
Dallas Police Department. The public elevators on this floor opened
into a lobby midpoint of a corridor that extended along the length
of the floor for about 140 feet. At one end of this 7-foot-wide corridor
were the offices occupied by Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry and his
immediate subordinates; at the other end was a small pressroom that
could accommodate only a handful of reporters. Along this corridor
were other police offices, including those of the major detective bureaus.
Between the pressroom and the lobby was the complex of offices
belonging to the homicide and robbery bureau, headed by Capt. J.
Will Fritz.<a id="FNanchor_C5-1" href="#Footnote_C5-1" class="fnanchor">C5-1</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 2175, <a href="#Page_197">p. 197</a>.)</p>

<h4 id="hdr108">Chronology</h4>

<p>The policemen who seized Oswald at the Texas Theatre arrived with
him at the police department building at about 2 p.m. and brought
him immediately to the third floor offices of the homicide and robbery
bureau to await the arrival of Captain Fritz from the Texas School
Book Depository. After about 15 or 20 minutes Oswald was ushered
into the office of Captain Fritz for the first of several interrogation
sessions.<a id="FNanchor_C5-2" href="#Footnote_C5-2" class="fnanchor">C5-2</a> At 4:05 p.m. he was taken to the basement assembly room
for his first lineup.<a id="FNanchor_C5-3" href="#Footnote_C5-3" class="fnanchor">C5-3</a> While waiting outside the lineup room, Oswald
was searched, and five cartridges and other items were removed from
his pockets.<a id="FNanchor_C5-4" href="#Footnote_C5-4" class="fnanchor">C5-4</a> After the lineup, at about 4:20, Oswald was returned to
Captain Fritz’ office for further questioning.<a id="FNanchor_C5-5" href="#Footnote_C5-5" class="fnanchor">C5-5</a> Two hours later, at
6:20 p.m., Oswald was taken downstairs for a second lineup and returned
to Captain Fritz’ office within 15 minutes for additional interrogation.<a id="FNanchor_C5-6" href="#Footnote_C5-6" class="fnanchor">C5-6</a>
Shortly after 7 p.m., Captain Fritz signed a complaint
charging Oswald with the murder of Patrolman Tippit. Oswald was
formally arraigned, i.e., advised of the charges, at 7:10 p.m., before
Justice of the Peace David L. Johnston, who came to Captain Fritz’
office for the occasion.<a id="FNanchor_C5-7" href="#Footnote_C5-7" class="fnanchor">C5-7</a></p>

<p>After a third lineup at about 7:40 p.m., Oswald was returned to
Fritz’ office.<a id="FNanchor_C5-8" href="#Footnote_C5-8" class="fnanchor">C5-8</a> About an hour later, after further questioning, Oswald’s
fingerprints and palmprints were taken and a paraffin test (see <a href="#APPENDIX_XI">app.
XI</a>) administered in Fritz’ office, after which the questioning resumed.<a id="FNanchor_C5-9" href="#Footnote_C5-9" class="fnanchor">C5-9</a>
At 11:26 p.m. Fritz signed the complaint charging Oswald with the
murder of President Kennedy.<a id="FNanchor_C5-10" href="#Footnote_C5-10" class="fnanchor">C5-10</a> Shortly after midnight, detectives
took Oswald to the basement assembly room for an appearance of
several minutes before members of the press.<a id="FNanchor_C5-11" href="#Footnote_C5-11" class="fnanchor">C5-11</a> At about 12:20 a.m.
Oswald was delivered to the jailer who placed him in a maximum
security cell on the fifth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C5-12" href="#Footnote_C5-12" class="fnanchor">C5-12</a> His cell was the center one in a block
of three cells that were separated from the remainder of the jail area.
The cells on either side of Oswald were empty and a guard was nearby
whenever Oswald was present.<a id="FNanchor_C5-13" href="#Footnote_C5-13" class="fnanchor">C5-13</a> Shortly after 1:30 a.m. Oswald was
brought to the identification bureau on the fourth floor and arraigned
before Justice of the Peace Johnston, this time for the murder of
President Kennedy.<a id="FNanchor_C5-14" href="#Footnote_C5-14" class="fnanchor">C5-14</a></p>

<p>Questioning resumed in Fritz’ office on Saturday morning at about
10:25 a.m., and the session lasted nearly an hour and 10 minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C5-15" href="#Footnote_C5-15" class="fnanchor">C5-15</a>
Oswald was then returned to his cell for an hour, and at 12:35 p.m.
he was brought back to Fritz’ office for an additional half-hour of
questioning.<a id="FNanchor_C5-16" href="#Footnote_C5-16" class="fnanchor">C5-16</a> From 1:10 to 1:30 p.m., Oswald’s wife and mother
visited him in the fourth floor visiting area;<a id="FNanchor_C5-17" href="#Footnote_C5-17" class="fnanchor">C5-17</a> at 1:40 p.m. he attempted
to call an attorney in New York.<a id="FNanchor_C5-18" href="#Footnote_C5-18" class="fnanchor">C5-18</a> He appeared in another
lineup at 2:15 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C5-19" href="#Footnote_C5-19" class="fnanchor">C5-19</a> At 2:45 p.m., with Oswald’s consent, a member
of the identification bureau obtained fingernail scrapings and specimens
of hair from him.<a id="FNanchor_C5-20" href="#Footnote_C5-20" class="fnanchor">C5-20</a> He returned to the fourth floor at 3:30<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
p.m. for a 10-minute visit with his brother, Robert.<a id="FNanchor_C5-21" href="#Footnote_C5-21" class="fnanchor">C5-21</a> Between 4 and
4:30 p.m., Oswald made two telephone calls to Mrs. Ruth Paine<a id="FNanchor_C5-22" href="#Footnote_C5-22" class="fnanchor">C5-22</a> at
her home in Irving; at about 5:30 p.m. he was visited by the president
of the Dallas Bar Association<a id="FNanchor_C5-23" href="#Footnote_C5-23" class="fnanchor">C5-23</a> with whom he spoke for about 5
minutes. From 6 to 7:15 p.m. Oswald was interrogated once again in
Captain Fritz’ office and then returned to his cell.<a id="FNanchor_C5-24" href="#Footnote_C5-24" class="fnanchor">C5-24</a> At 8 p.m. he
called the Paine residence again and asked to speak to his wife, but
Mrs. Paine told him that his wife was no longer there.<a id="FNanchor_C5-25" href="#Footnote_C5-25" class="fnanchor">C5-25</a></p>

<p>Oswald was signed out of jail at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, November
24, and taken to Captain Fritz’ office for a final round of questioning.<a id="FNanchor_C5-26" href="#Footnote_C5-26" class="fnanchor">C5-26</a>
The transfer party left Fritz’ office at about 11:15 a.m.;<a id="FNanchor_C5-27" href="#Footnote_C5-27" class="fnanchor">C5-27</a> at 11:21
a.m. Oswald was shot.<a id="FNanchor_C5-28" href="#Footnote_C5-28" class="fnanchor">C5-28</a> He was declared dead at Parkland Hospital
at 1:07 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C5-29" href="#Footnote_C5-29" class="fnanchor">C5-29</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr109">Interrogation Sessions</h4>

<p>During the period between 2:30 p.m. on Friday afternoon and 11:15
a.m. Sunday morning, Oswald was interrogated for a total of approximately
12 hours.<a id="FNanchor_C5-30" href="#Footnote_C5-30" class="fnanchor">C5-30</a> Though subject to intermittent questioning for
more than 7 hours on Friday, Oswald was given 8 to 9 hours to rest
that night. On Saturday he was questioned for a total of only 3 hours
during three interrogation sessions, and on Sunday he was questioned
for less than 2 hours.<a id="FNanchor_C5-31" href="#Footnote_C5-31" class="fnanchor">C5-31</a> (These interrogations are discussed in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">ch. IV</a>.)</p>

<p>Captain Fritz’ office, within which the interrogations took place, was
a small room, 14 feet by 9½ feet in size.<a id="FNanchor_C5-32" href="#Footnote_C5-32" class="fnanchor">C5-32</a> In addition to the policemen
guarding the prisoner, those present usually included Dallas
detectives, investigators from the FBI and the Secret Service, and
occasionally other officials, particularly a post office inspector and the
U.S. marshal. (See statements in <a href="#APPENDIX_XI">app. XI</a>.) As many as seven or
eight people crowded into the small office.<a id="FNanchor_C5-33" href="#Footnote_C5-33" class="fnanchor">C5-33</a> In all, more than 25
different persons participated in or were present at some time during
interrogations. Captain Fritz, who conducted most of the interrogations,
was frequently called from the room. He said, “I don’t believe
there was any time when I went through a very long period without
having to step to the door, or step outside, to get a report from some
pair of officers, or to give them additional assignments.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-34" href="#Footnote_C5-34" class="fnanchor">C5-34</a> In his
absence, others present would occasionally question Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C5-35" href="#Footnote_C5-35" class="fnanchor">C5-35</a></p>

<p>The interrogators differ on whether the confusion prevailing in
the main third floor corridor penetrated Fritz’ office and affected the
atmosphere within.<a id="FNanchor_C5-36" href="#Footnote_C5-36" class="fnanchor">C5-36</a> Oswald’s processions through the third floor
corridor, described more fully below, tended, in Fritz’ opinion, to keep
Oswald upset, and the remarks and questions of newsmen sometimes
caused him to become annoyed. Despite the confusion that frequently
prevailed, Oswald remained calm most of the time during the interrogations.<a id="FNanchor_C5-37" href="#Footnote_C5-37" class="fnanchor">C5-37</a>
According to Captain Fritz:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You know I didn’t have trouble with him. If we would just
talk to him quietly like we are talking right now, we talked all
right until I asked him a question that meant something, every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
time I asked him a question that meant something, that would
produce evidence he immediately told me he wouldn’t tell me
about it and he seemed to anticipate what I was going to ask.<a id="FNanchor_C5-38" href="#Footnote_C5-38" class="fnanchor">C5-38</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Special Agent James W. Bookhout, who represented the FBI at most
of the interrogations, stated, “I think generally you might say anytime
that you asked a question that would be pertinent to the investigation,
that would be the type of question he would refuse to
discuss.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-39" href="#Footnote_C5-39" class="fnanchor">C5-39</a></p>

<p>The number of people in the interrogation room and the tumultuous
atmosphere throughout the third floor made it difficult for the
interrogators to gain Oswald’s confidence and to encourage him to
be truthful. As Chief Curry has recognized in his testimony, “we
were violating every principle of interrogation * * * it was just
against all principles of good interrogation practice.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-40" href="#Footnote_C5-40" class="fnanchor">C5-40</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr110">Oswald’s Legal Rights</h4>

<p>All available evidence indicates that Oswald was not subjected to
any physical hardship during the interrogation sessions or at any
other time while he was in custody. He was fed and allowed to rest.
When he protested on Friday against being handcuffed from behind,
the cuffs were removed and he was handcuffed in front.<a id="FNanchor_C5-41" href="#Footnote_C5-41" class="fnanchor">C5-41</a> Although
he made remarks to newsmen about desiring a shower and demanding
his “civil rights,” Oswald did not complain about his treatment to
any of the numerous police officers and other persons who had
much to do with him during the 2 days of his detention.<a id="FNanchor_C5-42" href="#Footnote_C5-42" class="fnanchor">C5-42</a> As described
in chapter IV, Oswald received a slight cut over his right eye and a
bruise under his left eye during the scuffle in the Texas Theatre with the
arresting officers, three of whom were injured and required medical
treatment. These marks were visible to all who saw him during the
2 days of his detention and to millions of television viewers.<a id="FNanchor_C5-43" href="#Footnote_C5-43" class="fnanchor">C5-43</a></p>

<p>Before the first questioning session on Friday afternoon, Fritz
warned Oswald that he was not compelled to make any statement and
that statements he did make could be used against him.<a id="FNanchor_C5-44" href="#Footnote_C5-44" class="fnanchor">C5-44</a> About 5
hours later, he was arraigned for the Tippit murder and within an
additional 6½ hours he was arraigned for the murder of President
Kennedy. On each occasion the justice of the peace advised Oswald
of his right to obtain counsel and the right to remain silent.<a id="FNanchor_C5-45" href="#Footnote_C5-45" class="fnanchor">C5-45</a></p>

<p>Throughout the period of detention, however, Oswald was not represented
by counsel. At the Friday midnight press conference in
the basement assembly room, he made the following remarks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Well, I was questioned by Judge —— [Johnston].
However, I protested at that time that I was not allowed legal
representation during that very short and sweet hearing. I really
don’t know what the situation is about. Nobody has told me
anything except that I am accused of, of, murdering a policeman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
I know nothing more than that and I do request someone
to come forward to give me legal assistance.</p>

<p>Q. Did you kill the President?</p>

<p>A. No. I have not been charged with that. In fact nobody has
said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when
the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Q. Mr. Oswald, how did you hurt your eye?</p>

<p>A. A policeman hit me.<a id="FNanchor_C5-46" href="#Footnote_C5-46" class="fnanchor">C5-46</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">At this time Oswald had been arraigned only for the murder of Patrolman
Tippit, but questioning by Captain Fritz and others had been
substantially concerned with Oswald’s connection with the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C5-47" href="#Footnote_C5-47" class="fnanchor">C5-47</a></p>

<p>On Friday evening, representatives of the American Civil Liberties
Union visited the police department to determine whether Oswald
was being deprived of counsel. They were assured by police officials
and Justice of the Peace Johnston that Oswald had been informed of
his rights and was being allowed to seek a lawyer.<a id="FNanchor_C5-48" href="#Footnote_C5-48" class="fnanchor">C5-48</a> On Saturday
Oswald attempted several times to reach John Abt, a New York lawyer,
by telephone, but with no success.<a id="FNanchor_C5-49" href="#Footnote_C5-49" class="fnanchor">C5-49</a> In the afternoon, he called
Ruth Paine and asked her to try to reach Abt for him, but she too
failed.<a id="FNanchor_C5-50" href="#Footnote_C5-50" class="fnanchor">C5-50</a> Later in the afternoon, H. Louis Nichols, president of the
Dallas Bar Association, visited Oswald in his cell and asked him
whether he wanted the association to obtain a lawyer for him. Oswald
declined the offer, stating a first preference for Abt and a second
preference for a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union.<a id="FNanchor_C5-51" href="#Footnote_C5-51" class="fnanchor">C5-51</a>
As late as Sunday morning, according to Postal Inspector Harry D.
Holmes, Oswald said that he preferred to get his own lawyer.<a id="FNanchor_C5-52" href="#Footnote_C5-52" class="fnanchor">C5-52</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr111">ACTIVITY OF NEWSMEN</h3>

<p>Within an hour of Oswald’s arrival at the police department on
November 22, it became known to newsmen that he was a possible
suspect in the slaying of President Kennedy as well as in the murder
of Patrolman Tippit. At least as early as 3:26 p.m. a television report
carried this information. Reporters and cameramen flooded
into the building and congregated in the corridor of the third floor,
joining those few who had been present when Oswald first arrived.<a id="FNanchor_C5-53" href="#Footnote_C5-53" class="fnanchor">C5-53</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr112">On the Third Floor</h4>

<p>Felix McKnight, editor of the Dallas Times-Herald, who handled
press arrangements for the President’s visit, estimated that within
24 hours of the assassination more than 300 representatives of news
media were in Dallas, including correspondents from foreign newspapers
and press associations.<a id="FNanchor_C5-54" href="#Footnote_C5-54" class="fnanchor">C5-54</a> District Attorney Henry M. Wade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
thought that the crowd in the third floor hallway itself may have
numbered as many as 300.<a id="FNanchor_C5-55" href="#Footnote_C5-55" class="fnanchor">C5-55</a> Most estimates, including those based
on examination of video tapes, place upwards of 100 newsmen and
cameramen in the third floor corridor of the police department by
the evening of November 22.<a id="FNanchor_C5-56" href="#Footnote_C5-56" class="fnanchor">C5-56</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 2633,
<a href="#Page_203">p. 203</a>.)</p>

<p>In the words of an FBI agent who was present, the conditions at
the police station were “not too much unlike Grand Central Station
at rush hour, maybe like the Yankee Stadium during the World Series
games. * * *”<a id="FNanchor_C5-57" href="#Footnote_C5-57" class="fnanchor">C5-57</a> In the lobby of the third floor, television cameramen
set up two large cameras and floodlights in strategic positions that
gave them a sweep of the corridor in either direction. Technicians
stretched their television cables into and out of offices, running some
of them out of the windows of a deputy chief’s office and down the
side of the building. Men with newsreel cameras, still cameras, and
microphones, more mobile than the television cameramen, moved back
and forth seeking information and opportunities for interviews.
Newsmen wandered into the offices of other bureaus located on the third
floor, sat on desks, and used police telephones; indeed, one reporter
admits hiding a telephone behind a desk so that he would have exclusive
access to it if something developed.<a id="FNanchor_C5-58" href="#Footnote_C5-58" class="fnanchor">C5-58</a></p>

<p>By the time Chief Curry returned to the building in the middle of
the afternoon from Love Field where he had escorted President
Johnson from Parkland Hospital, he found that “there was just
pandemonium on the third floor.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-59" href="#Footnote_C5-59" class="fnanchor">C5-59</a> The news representatives, he
testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * were jammed into the north hall of the third floor, which are
the offices of the criminal investigation division. The television
trucks, there were several of them around the city hall. I went
into my administrative offices, I saw cables coming through the
administrative assistant office and through the deputy chief of
traffic through his office, and running through the hall they had
a live TV set up on the third floor, and it was a bedlam of
confusion.<a id="FNanchor_C5-60" href="#Footnote_C5-60" class="fnanchor">C5-60</a></p></blockquote>

<p>According to Special Agent Winston G. Lawson of the Secret
Service:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At least by 6 or 7 o’clock * * * [the reporters and cameramen]
were quite in evidence up and down the corridors, cameras on the
tripods, the sound equipment, people with still cameras, motion
picture-type hand cameras, all kinds of people with tape recorders,
and they were trying to interview people, anybody that belonged
in police headquarters that might know anything about
Oswald * * *<a id="FNanchor_C5-61" href="#Footnote_C5-61" class="fnanchor">C5-61</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<div id="ip_203" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 38.3125em;">

<p>Scene in third floor corridor.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
The corridor became so jammed that policemen and newsmen had
to push and shove if they wanted to get through, stepping over cables,
wires, and tripods.<a id="FNanchor_C5-62" href="#Footnote_C5-62" class="fnanchor">C5-62</a> The crowd in the hallway was so dense that District
Attorney Wade found it a “strain to get the door open” to get
into the homicide office.<a id="FNanchor_C5-63" href="#Footnote_C5-63" class="fnanchor">C5-63</a> According to Lawson, “You had to literally
fight your way through the people to get up and down the corridor.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-64" href="#Footnote_C5-64" class="fnanchor">C5-64</a>
A witness who was escorted into the homicide offices on Saturday afternoon
related that he</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">tried to get by the reporters, stepping over television cables and
you couldn’t hardly get by, they would grab you and wanted to
know what you were doing down here, even with the detectives
one in front and one behind you.<a id="FNanchor_C5-65" href="#Footnote_C5-65" class="fnanchor">C5-65</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The television cameras continued to record the scene on the third floor
as some of the newsmen kept vigil through the night.<a id="FNanchor_C5-66" href="#Footnote_C5-66" class="fnanchor">C5-66</a></p>

<p>Such police efforts as there were to control the newsmen were unavailing.
Capt. Glen D. King, administrative assistant to Chief Curry,
witnessed efforts to clear an aisle through the hallway, but related
that “this was a constant battle because of the number of newsmen
who were there. They would move back into the aisleway that
had been cleared. They interfered with the movement of people who
had to be there.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-67" href="#Footnote_C5-67" class="fnanchor">C5-67</a> According to one detective, “they would be asked
to stand back and stay back but it wouldn’t do much good, and they
would push forward and you had to hold them off physically.” The
detective recalled that on one occasion when he was escorting a witness
through the corridor he “stopped * * * and looked down and there
was a joker had a camera stuck between * * * [his] legs taking pictures.
* * *”<a id="FNanchor_C5-68" href="#Footnote_C5-68" class="fnanchor">C5-68</a> Forrest V. Sorrels of the Secret Service had the
impression that the “press and the television people just * * * took
over.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-69" href="#Footnote_C5-69" class="fnanchor">C5-69</a></p>

<p>Police control over the access of other than newsmen to the third
floor was of limited but increasing effectiveness after Oswald’s arrival
at the police department. Initially no steps were taken to exclude
unauthorized persons from the third floor corridor, but late Friday
afternoon Assistant Chief Charles Batchelor stationed guards at the
elevators and the stairway to prevent the admission of such persons.
He also directed the records room in the basement to issue passes, after
verification by the bureaus involved, to people who had legitimate
business on the third floor.<a id="FNanchor_C5-70" href="#Footnote_C5-70" class="fnanchor">C5-70</a> Throughout the 3 days of Oswald’s detention,
the police were obliged to continue normal business in all five
bureaus located along the third floor hallway. Thus many persons—relatives
of prisoners, complainants, witnesses<a id="FNanchor_C5-71" href="#Footnote_C5-71" class="fnanchor">C5-71</a>—had occasion to
visit police offices on the third floor on business unrelated to the investigation
of the assassination.</p>

<p>Newsmen seeking admission to the third floor were required to identify
themselves by their personal press cards; however, the department
did not follow its usual procedure of checking the authenticity of press
credentials.<a id="FNanchor_C5-72" href="#Footnote_C5-72" class="fnanchor">C5-72</a> Captain King felt that this would have been impossible
in light of “the atmosphere that existed over there, the tremendous
pressures that existed, the fact that telephones were ringing constantly,
that there were droves of people in there * * * the fact that the method
by which you positively identify someone * * * it’s not easy.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span><a id="FNanchor_C5-73" href="#Footnote_C5-73" class="fnanchor">C5-73</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
Police officers on the third floor testified that they carefully checked
all persons for credentials, and most newsmen indicated that after
Batchelor imposed security they were required to identify themselves
by their press cards.<a id="FNanchor_C5-74" href="#Footnote_C5-74" class="fnanchor">C5-74</a> Special Agent Sorrels of the Secret Service
stated that he was requested to present credentials on some of his visits
to the third floor.<a id="FNanchor_C5-75" href="#Footnote_C5-75" class="fnanchor">C5-75</a> However, other newsmen apparently went unchallenged
during the entire period before Oswald was killed, although
some of them were wearing press badges on their lapels and
some may have been known to the police officers.<a id="FNanchor_C5-76" href="#Footnote_C5-76" class="fnanchor">C5-76</a></p>

<p>According to some reporters and policemen, people who appeared
to be unauthorized were present on the third floor after security procedures
were instituted, and video tapes seem to confirm their observations.<a id="FNanchor_C5-77" href="#Footnote_C5-77" class="fnanchor">C5-77</a>
Jack Ruby was present on the third floor on Friday night.<a id="FNanchor_C5-78" href="#Footnote_C5-78" class="fnanchor">C5-78</a>
Assistant Chief of Police N. T. Fisher testified that even on Saturday
“anybody could come up with a plausible reason for going to one of
the third floor bureaus and was able to get in.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-79" href="#Footnote_C5-79" class="fnanchor">C5-79</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr113">Oswald and the Press</h4>

<p>When the police car bringing Oswald from the Texas Theatre drove
into the basement of police headquarters at about 2 p.m. on Friday,
some reporters and cameramen, principally from local papers and stations,
were already on hand. The policemen formed a wedge around
Oswald and conducted him to the elevator, but several newsmen
crowded into the elevator with Oswald and the police. When the elevator
stopped at the third floor, the cameramen ran ahead down the
corridor, and then turned around and backed up, taking pictures of
Oswald as he was escorted toward the homicide and robbery bureau
office. According to one escorting officer, some six or seven reporters
followed the police into the bureau office.<a id="FNanchor_C5-80" href="#Footnote_C5-80" class="fnanchor">C5-80</a></p>

<p>From Friday afternoon, when Oswald arrived in the building, until
Sunday, newspaper reporters and television cameras focused their
attention on the homicide office. In full view and within arm’s length
of the assembled newsmen, Oswald traversed the 20 feet of corridor
between the homicide office and the locked door leading to the jail
elevator at least 15 times after his initial arrival. The jail elevator,
sealed off from public use, took him to his fifth floor cell and to the
assembly room in the basement for lineups and the Friday night news
conference.<a id="FNanchor_C5-81" href="#Footnote_C5-81" class="fnanchor">C5-81</a></p>

<p>On most occasions, Oswald’s escort of three to six detectives and
policemen had to push their way through the newsmen who sought to
surround them. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2631, <a href="#Page_205">p. 205</a>.) Although
the Dallas press normally did not take pictures of a prisoner
without first obtaining permission of the police, who generally asked
the prisoner, this practice was not followed by any of the newsmen
with Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C5-82" href="#Footnote_C5-82" class="fnanchor">C5-82</a> Generally when Oswald appeared the newsmen turned
their cameras on him, thrust microphones at his face, and shouted
questions at him. Sometimes he answered. Reporters in the forefront
of the throng would repeat his answers for the benefit of those behind
them who could not hear. On Saturday, however in response to police
admonitions, the reporters exercised more restraint and shouted fewer
questions at Oswald when he passed through the corridor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span><a id="FNanchor_C5-83" href="#Footnote_C5-83" class="fnanchor">C5-83</a></p>

<p>OSWALD AT PRESS CONFERENCE IN ASSEMBLY ROOM, FRIDAY NIGHT</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
Oswald’s most prolonged exposure occurred at the midnight press
conference on Friday night. In response to demands of newsmen,
District Attorney Wade, after consulting with Chief Curry and Captain
Fritz, had announced shortly before midnight that Oswald would
appear at a press conference in the basement assembly room.<a id="FNanchor_C5-84" href="#Footnote_C5-84" class="fnanchor">C5-84</a> An
estimated 70 to 100 people, including Jack Ruby, and other unauthorized
persons, crowded into the small downstairs room. No identification
was required.<a id="FNanchor_C5-85" href="#Footnote_C5-85" class="fnanchor">C5-85</a> The room was so packed that Deputy Chief M. W.
Stevenson and Captain Fritz who came down to the basement after
the crowd had assembled could not get in and were forced to remain
in the doorway.<a id="FNanchor_C5-86" href="#Footnote_C5-86" class="fnanchor">C5-86</a></p>

<p>Oswald was brought into the room shortly after midnight.<a id="FNanchor_C5-87" href="#Footnote_C5-87" class="fnanchor">C5-87</a> Curry
had instructed policemen not to permit newsmen to touch Oswald or
get close to him, but no steps were taken to shield Oswald from the
crowd.<a id="FNanchor_C5-88" href="#Footnote_C5-88" class="fnanchor">C5-88</a> Captain Fritz had asked that Oswald be placed on the platform
used for lineups so that he could be more easily removed “if anything
happened.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-89" href="#Footnote_C5-89" class="fnanchor">C5-89</a> Chief Curry, however, insisted that Oswald stand
on the floor in front of the stage, where he was also in front of the
one-way nylon-cloth screen customarily used to prevent a suspect from
seeing those present in the room. This was done because cameramen
had told Curry that their cameras would not photograph well through
the screen.<a id="FNanchor_C5-90" href="#Footnote_C5-90" class="fnanchor">C5-90</a></p>

<p>Curry had instructed the reporters that they were not to “ask any
questions and try to interview * * * [Oswald] in any way,” but when
he was brought into the room, “immediately they began to shoot
questions at him and shove microphones into his face.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-91" href="#Footnote_C5-91" class="fnanchor">C5-91</a> It was
difficult to hear Oswald’s answers above the uproar. Cameramen stood
on the tables to take pictures and others pushed forward to get close-ups.
(See Commission Exhibit No. 2965, <a href="#Page_207">p. 207</a>.) The noise and confusion
mounted as reporters shouted at each other to get out of the way
and camermen made frantic efforts to get into position for pictures.<a id="FNanchor_C5-92" href="#Footnote_C5-92" class="fnanchor">C5-92</a>
After Oswald had been in the room only a few minutes, Chief Curry
intervened and directed that Oswald be taken back to the jail because,
he testified, the newsmen “tried to overrun him.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-93" href="#Footnote_C5-93" class="fnanchor">C5-93</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr114">THE ABORTIVE TRANSFER</h3>

<p>In Dallas, after a person is charged with a felony, the county sheriff
ordinarily takes custody of the prisoner and assumes responsibility
for his safekeeping. Normally, the Dallas Police Department notifies
the sheriff when a prisoner has been charged with a felony and
the sheriff dispatches his deputies to transport the accused to the
county jail. This is usually done within a few hours after the complaint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
has been filed. In cases of unusual importance, however, the
Dallas city police sometimes transport the prisoners to the county
jail.<a id="FNanchor_C5-94" href="#Footnote_C5-94" class="fnanchor">C5-94</a></p>

<p>The decision to move Oswald to the county jail on Sunday morning
was reached by Chief Curry the preceding evening. Sometime after
7:30 Saturday evening, according to Assistant Chief Batchelor, two
reporters told him that they wanted to go out to dinner but that “they
didn’t want to miss anything if we were going to move the prisoner.”
Curry came upon them at that point and told the two newsmen
that if they returned by 10 o’clock in the morning, they wouldn’t
“miss anything.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-95" href="#Footnote_C5-95" class="fnanchor">C5-95</a> A little later, after checking with Captain Fritz,
Curry made a similar announcement to the assembled reporters.
Curry reported the making of his decision to move Oswald as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Then, I talked to Fritz about when he thought he would transfer
the prisoner, and he didn’t think it was a good idea to transfer
him at night because of the fact you couldn’t see, and if anybody
tried to cause them any trouble, they needed to see who they were
and where it was coming from and so forth, and he suggested
that we wait until daylight, so this was normal procedure, I mean,
for Fritz to determine when he is going to transfer his prisoners,
so I told him “Okay.” I asked him, I said, “What time do you
think you will be ready tomorrow?” And he didn’t know exactly
and I said, “Do you think about 10 o’clock,” and he said, “I
believe so,” and then is when I went out and told the newspaper
people * * * “I believe if you are back here by 10 o’clock you
will be back in time to observe anything you care to observe.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-96" href="#Footnote_C5-96" class="fnanchor">C5-96</a></p></blockquote>

<p>During the night, between 2:30 and 3 a.m., the local office of the
FBI and the sheriff’s office received telephone calls from an unidentified
man who warned that a committee had decided “to kill the man
that killed the President.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-97" href="#Footnote_C5-97" class="fnanchor">C5-97</a> Shortly after, an FBI agent notified
the Dallas police of the anonymous threat. The police department
and ultimately Chief Curry were informed of both threats.<a id="FNanchor_C5-98" href="#Footnote_C5-98" class="fnanchor">C5-98</a></p>

<p>Immediately after his arrival at the building on Sunday morning
between 8:30 and 8:45 a.m., Curry spoke by telephone with Sheriff
J. E. Decker about the transfer. When Decker indicated that he
would leave to Curry the decision on whether the sheriff’s office or
the police would move Oswald, Curry decided that the police would
handle it because “we had so much involved here, we were the ones
that were investigating the case and we had the officers set up downstairs
to handle it.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-99" href="#Footnote_C5-99" class="fnanchor">C5-99</a></p>

<p>After talking with Decker, Curry began to discuss plans for the
transfer. With the threats against Oswald in mind, Curry suggested
to Batchelor and Deputy Chief Stevenson that Oswald be transported
to the county jail in an armored truck, to which they agreed. While
Batchelor made arrangements to have an armored truck brought to
the building, Curry and Stevenson tentatively agreed on the route the
armored truck would follow from the building to the county jail.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span><a id="FNanchor_C5-100" href="#Footnote_C5-100" class="fnanchor">C5-100</a></p>

<p>Curry decided that Oswald would leave the building via the basement.
He stated later that he reached this decision shortly after his
arrival at the police building Sunday morning, when members of the
press had already begun to gather in the basement. There is no evidence
that anyone opposed this decision.<a id="FNanchor_C5-101" href="#Footnote_C5-101" class="fnanchor">C5-101</a> Two members of the
Dallas police did suggest to Captain Fritz that Oswald be taken from
the building by another exit, leaving the press “waiting in the basement
and on Commerce Street, and we could be to the county jail
before anyone knew what was taking place.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-102" href="#Footnote_C5-102" class="fnanchor">C5-102</a> However, Fritz
said that he did not think Curry would agree to such a plan because
he had promised that Oswald would be transferred at a time when
newsmen could take pictures.<a id="FNanchor_C5-103" href="#Footnote_C5-103" class="fnanchor">C5-103</a> Forrest Sorrels also suggested to
Fritz that Oswald be moved at an unannounced time when no one
was around, but Fritz again responded that Curry “wanted to go
along with the press and not try to put anything over on them.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-104" href="#Footnote_C5-104" class="fnanchor">C5-104</a></p>

<p>Preliminary arrangements to obtain additional personnel to assist
with the transfer were begun Saturday evening. On Saturday night,
the police reserves were requested to provide 8 to 10 men on Sunday,
and additional reservists were sought in the morning.<a id="FNanchor_C5-105" href="#Footnote_C5-105" class="fnanchor">C5-105</a> Capt. C. E.
Talbert, who was in charge of the patrol division for the city of Dallas
on the morning of November 24, retained a small number of policemen
in the building when he took charge that morning and later ordered
other patrolmen from several districts to report to the basement.<a id="FNanchor_C5-106" href="#Footnote_C5-106" class="fnanchor">C5-106</a>
At about 9 a.m. Deputy Chief Stevenson instructed all detectives
within the building to remain for the transfer.<a id="FNanchor_C5-107" href="#Footnote_C5-107" class="fnanchor">C5-107</a> Sheriff Decker
testified that his men were ready to receive Oswald at the county jail
from the early hours of Sunday morning.<a id="FNanchor_C5-108" href="#Footnote_C5-108" class="fnanchor">C5-108</a></p>

<p>With the patrolmen and reserve policemen available to him, Captain
Talbert, on his own initiative, undertook to secure the basement
of the police department building. He placed policemen outside the
building at the top of the Commerce Street ramp to keep all spectators
on the opposite side of Commerce Street. Later, Talbert directed
that patrolmen be assigned to all street intersections the transfer
vehicle would cross along the route to the county jail.<a id="FNanchor_C5-109" href="#Footnote_C5-109" class="fnanchor">C5-109</a> His most
significant security precautions, however, were steps designed to exclude
unauthorized persons from the basement area.</p>

<p>The spacious basement of the Police and Courts Building contains,
among other things, the jail office and the police garage. (See Commission
Exhibit No. 2179, <a href="#Page_211">p. 211</a>.) The jail office, into which the jail
elevator opens, is situated on the west side of an auto ramp cutting
across the length of the basement from Main Street, on the north
side of the building, to Commerce Street, on the south side. From the
foot of this ramp, on the east side, midway through the basement, a
decline runs down a short distance to the <b class="sans">L</b>-shaped police garage. In
addition to the auto ramp, five doors to the garage provide access to
the basement from the Police and Courts Building on the west side of
the garage and the attached Municipal Building on the east. Three
of these five doors provide access to three elevators opening into the
garage, two for passengers near the central part of the garage and
one for service at the east end of the garage. A fourth door near
the passenger elevator opens into the municipal building; the fifth
door, at the Commerce Street side of the garage, opens into a sub-basement
that is connected with both buildings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span><a id="FNanchor_C5-110" href="#Footnote_C5-110" class="fnanchor">C5-110</a></p>

<p>BASEMENT</p>

<p>DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT, DALLAS, TEXAS</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
Shortly after 9 o’clock Sunday morning, policemen cleared the basement
of all but police personnel. Guards were stationed at the top
of the Main and Commerce Streets auto ramps leading down into the
basement, at each of the five doorways into the garage, and at the
double doors leading to the public hallway adjacent to the jail office.
Then, Sgt. Patrick T. Dean, acting under instructions from
Talbert, directed 14 men in a search of the garage. Maintenance
workers were directed to leave the area. The searchers examined the
rafters, tops of air conditioning ducts, and every closet and room
opening off the garage. They searched the interior and trunk compartment
of automobiles parked in the garage. The two passenger
elevators in the central part of the garage were not in service and
the doors were shut and locked; the service elevator was moved to
the first floor, and the operator was instructed not to return it to the
basement.<a id="FNanchor_C5-111" href="#Footnote_C5-111" class="fnanchor">C5-111</a></p>

<p>Despite the thoroughness with which the search was conducted,
there still existed one and perhaps two weak points in controlling
access to the garage. Testimony did not resolve positively whether or
not the stairway door near the public elevators was locked both from
the inside and outside as was necessary to secure it effectively.<a id="FNanchor_C5-112" href="#Footnote_C5-112" class="fnanchor">C5-112</a> And
although guards were stationed near the double doors, the hallway
near the jail office was accessible to people from inside the Police and
Courts Building without the necessity of presenting identification.
Until seconds before Oswald was shot, newsmen hurrying to photograph
Oswald were able to run without challenge through those doors
into the basement.<a id="FNanchor_C5-113" href="#Footnote_C5-113" class="fnanchor">C5-113</a></p>

<p>After the search had been completed, the police allowed news representatives
to reenter the basement area and gather along the entrance
to the garage on the east side of the ramp. Later, the police permitted
the newsmen to stand in front of the railing on the east side
of the ramp leading to Main Street. The policemen deployed by
Talbert and Dean had instructions to allow no one but identified
news media representatives into the basement. As before, the police
accepted any credentials that appeared authentic, though some officers
did make special efforts to check for pictures and other forms of
corroborating identification. Many newsmen reported that they were
checked on more than one occasion while they waited in the basement.
A small number did not recall that their credentials were ever
checked.<a id="FNanchor_C5-114" href="#Footnote_C5-114" class="fnanchor">C5-114</a></p>

<p>Shortly after his arrival on Sunday morning, Chief Curry issued
instructions to keep reporters and cameramen out of the jail office
and to keep television equipment behind the railing separating the
basement auto ramp from the garage. Curry observed that in other
respects Captain Talbert appeared to have security measures in hand
and allowed him to proceed on his own initiative. Batchelor and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Stevenson checked progress in the basement during the course of
the morning, and the officials were generally satisfied with the steps
Talbert had taken.<a id="FNanchor_C5-115" href="#Footnote_C5-115" class="fnanchor">C5-115</a></p>

<p>At about 11 a.m., Deputy Chief Stevenson requested that Capt. O. A.
Jones of the forgery bureau bring all available detectives from the
third floor offices to the basement. Jones instructed the detectives
who accompanied him to the basement to line the walls on either
side of the passageway cleared for the transfer party.<a id="FNanchor_C5-116" href="#Footnote_C5-116" class="fnanchor">C5-116</a> According
to Detective T. D. McMillon,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * Captain Jones explained to us that, when they brought the
prisoner out, that he wanted two lines formed and we were to keep
these two lines formed, you know, a barrier on either side of
them, kind of an aisle * * * for them to walk through, and
when they came down this aisle, we were to keep this line intact
and move along with them until the man was placed in the car.<a id="FNanchor_C5-117" href="#Footnote_C5-117" class="fnanchor">C5-117</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With Assistant Chief Batchelor’s permission, Jones removed photographers
who had gathered once again in the basement jail office.
Jones recalled that he instructed all newsmen along the Main Street
ramp to remain behind an imaginary line extending from the southeast
corner of the jail office to the railing on the east side of the ramp;
other officers recalled that Jones directed the newsmen to move away
from the foot of the Main Street ramp and to line up against the east
railing. In any event, newsmen were allowed to congregate along the
foot of the ramp after Batchelor observed that there was insufficient
room along the east of the ramp to permit all the news representatives
to see Oswald as he was brought out.<a id="FNanchor_C5-118" href="#Footnote_C5-118" class="fnanchor">C5-118</a></p>

<p>By the time Oswald reached the basement, 40 to 50 newsmen and 70
to 75 police officers were assembled there. Three television cameras
stood along the railing and most of the newsmen were congregated in
that area and at the top of the adjacent decline leading into the garage.
A group of newsmen and police officers, best estimated at about 20,
stood strung across the bottom of the Main Street ramp. Along the
south wall of the passageway outside the jail office door were about
eight detectives, and three detectives lined the north wall. Two
officers stood in front of the double doors leading into the passageway
from the corridor next to the jail office.<a id="FNanchor_C5-119" href="#Footnote_C5-119" class="fnanchor">C5-119</a> (See Commission Exhibit
No. 2634, <a href="#Page_214">p. 214</a>.)</p>

<p>Beginning Saturday night, the public had been kept informed of
the approximate time of the transfer. At approximately 10:20 a.m.
Curry told a press conference that Oswald would be moved in an
armored truck and gave a general description of other security precautions.<a id="FNanchor_C5-120" href="#Footnote_C5-120" class="fnanchor">C5-120</a>
Apparently no newsmen were informed of the transfer
route, however, and the route was not disclosed to the driver of the
armored truck until the truck arrived at the Commerce Street exit at
about 11:07 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_C5-121" href="#Footnote_C5-121" class="fnanchor">C5-121</a> When they learned of its arrival, many of the remaining
newsmen who had waited on the third floor descended to the
basement. Shortly after, newsmen may have had another indication
that the transfer was imminent if they caught a glimpse through the
glass windows of Oswald putting on a sweater in Captain Fritz’
office.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span><a id="FNanchor_C5-122" href="#Footnote_C5-122" class="fnanchor">C5-122</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
Because the driver feared that the truck might stall if it had to
start from the bottom of the ramp and because the overhead clearance
appeared to be inadequate, Assistant Chief Batchelor had it backed
only into the entranceway at the top of the ramp. Batchelor and
others then inspected the inside of the truck.<a id="FNanchor_C5-123" href="#Footnote_C5-123" class="fnanchor">C5-123</a></p>

<p>When Chief Curry learned that the truck had arrived, he informed
Captain Fritz that security controls were in effect and inquired how
long the questioning of Oswald would continue. At this point, Fritz
learned for the first time of the plan to convey Oswald by armored
truck and immediately expressed his disapproval. He urged the use
of an unmarked police car driven by a police officer, pointing out that
this would be better from the standpoint of both speed and maneuverability.
Curry agreed to Fritz’ plan; the armored truck would be
used as a decoy. They decided that the armored truck would leave
the ramp first, followed by a car which would contain only security
officers. A police car bearing Oswald would follow. After proceeding
one block, the car with Oswald would turn off and proceed directly
to the county jail; the armored truck would follow a lead car to the
jail along the previously agreed upon and more circuitous route.<a id="FNanchor_C5-124" href="#Footnote_C5-124" class="fnanchor">C5-124</a></p>

<p>Captain Fritz instructed Detectives C. W. Brown and C. N.
Dhority and a third detective to proceed to the garage and move the
followup car and the transfer car into place on the auto ramp. He
told Lt. Rio S. Pierce to obtain another automobile from the basement
and take up a lead position on Commerce Street.<a id="FNanchor_C5-125" href="#Footnote_C5-125" class="fnanchor">C5-125</a> Deputy Chief
Stevenson went back to the basement to inform Batchelor and Jones
of the change in plans.<a id="FNanchor_C5-126" href="#Footnote_C5-126" class="fnanchor">C5-126</a> Oswald was given his sweater, and then
his right hand was handcuffed to the left hand of Detective J. R.
Leavelle.<a id="FNanchor_C5-127" href="#Footnote_C5-127" class="fnanchor">C5-127</a> Detective T. L. Baker called the jail office to check on
security precautions in the basement and notify officials that the
prisoner was being brought down.<a id="FNanchor_C5-128" href="#Footnote_C5-128" class="fnanchor">C5-128</a></p>

<p>On arriving in the basement, Pierce asked Sgts. James A. Putnam
and Billy Joe Maxey to accompany him in the lead car. Since the
armored truck was blocking the Commerce Street ramp, it would be
necessary to drive out the Main Street ramp and circle the block to
Commerce Street. Maxey sat on the back seat of Pierce’s car, and
Putnam helped clear a path through reporters on the ramp so that
Pierce could drive up toward Main Street. When the car passed by
the reporters at about 11:20 a.m., Putnam entered the car on the right
front side. Pierce drove to the top of the Main Street ramp and
slowed momentarily as Patrolman Roy E. Vaughn stepped from his
position at the top of the ramp toward the street to watch for traffic.<a id="FNanchor_C5-129" href="#Footnote_C5-129" class="fnanchor">C5-129</a>
After Pierce’s car left the garage area, Brown drove another police
car out of the garage, moved part way up the Commerce Street ramp,
and began to back down into position to receive Oswald. Dhority
also proceeded to drive the followup car into position ahead of
Brown.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span><a id="FNanchor_C5-130" href="#Footnote_C5-130" class="fnanchor">C5-130</a></p>

<p>As Pierce’s car started up the ramp at about 11:20 a.m., Oswald,
accompanied by Captain Fritz and four detectives, arrived at the jail
office. Cameramen in the hallway of the basement took pictures of
Oswald through the interior glass windows of the jail office as he
was led through the office to the exit.<a id="FNanchor_C5-131" href="#Footnote_C5-131" class="fnanchor">C5-131</a> Some of these cameramen
then ran through the double doors near the jail office and squeezed into
the line which had formed across the Main Street ramp.<a id="FNanchor_C5-132" href="#Footnote_C5-132" class="fnanchor">C5-132</a> Still
others remained just inside the double doors or proceeded through the
double doors after Oswald and his escort emerged from the jail
office.<a id="FNanchor_C5-133" href="#Footnote_C5-133" class="fnanchor">C5-133</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 2177, <a href="#Page_217">p. 217</a>.)</p>

<p>When Fritz came to the jail office door, he asked if everything was
ready, and a detective standing in the passageway answered yes.<a id="FNanchor_C5-134" href="#Footnote_C5-134" class="fnanchor">C5-134</a>
Someone shouted, “Here he comes!”; additional spotlights were turned
on in the basement, and the din increased. A detective stepped from
the jail office and proceeded toward the transfer car. Seconds later
Fritz and then Oswald, with Detective Leavelle at his right, Detective
L. C. Graves at his left, and Detective L. D. Montgomery at his
rear, came through the door. Fritz walked to Brown’s car, which
had not yet backed fully into position; Oswald followed a few feet
behind. Newsmen near the double door moved forward after him.<a id="FNanchor_C5-135" href="#Footnote_C5-135" class="fnanchor">C5-135</a>
Though movie films and video tapes indicate that the front line of
newsmen along the Main Street ramp remained fairly stationary,
it was the impression of many who were close to the scene that with
Oswald’s appearance the crowd surged forward. According to Detective
Montgomery, who was walking directly behind Oswald, “as
soon as we came out this door * * * this bunch here just moved in on
us.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-136" href="#Footnote_C5-136" class="fnanchor">C5-136</a> To Detective B. H. Combest, standing on the Commerce
Street side of the passageway from the jail office door, it appeared
that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Almost the whole line of people pushed forward when Oswald
started to leave the jail office, the door, the hall—all the newsmen
were poking their sound mikes across to him and asking questions,
and they were everyone sticking their flashbulbs up and
around and over him and in his face.<a id="FNanchor_C5-137" href="#Footnote_C5-137" class="fnanchor">C5-137</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">After Oswald had moved about 10 feet from the door of the jail office,
Jack Ruby passed between a newsman and a detective at the edge
of the straining crowd on the Main Street ramp. With his right
hand extended and holding a .38 caliber revolver, Ruby stepped
quickly forward and fired a single fatal bullet into Oswald’s
abdomen.<a id="FNanchor_C5-138" href="#Footnote_C5-138" class="fnanchor">C5-138</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 2636, <a href="#Page_218">p. 218</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="hdr115">POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE TO JACK RUBY IN ENTERING THE BASEMENT</h3>

<p>The killing of Lee Harvey Oswald in the basement of police headquarters
in the midst of more than 70 police officers gave rise to immediate
speculation that one or more members of the police department
provided Jack Ruby assistance which had enabled him to enter
the basement and approach within a few feet of the accused Presidential
assassin. In chapter VI, the Commission has considered whether
there is any evidence linking Jack Ruby with a conspiracy to kill the
President. At this point, however, it is appropriate to consider
whether there is evidence that Jack Ruby received assistance from
Dallas policemen or others in gaining access to the basement on the
morning of November 24. An affirmative answer would require that
the evidence be evaluated for possible connection with the assassination
itself. While the Commission has found no evidence that Ruby
received assistance from any person in entering the basement, his
means of entry is significant in evaluating the adequacy of the precautions
taken to protect Oswald.</p>

<p>Ruby shooting Oswald (Sunday, November 24).</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
Although more than a hundred policemen and newsmen were present
in the basement of police headquarters during the 10 minutes before
the shooting of Oswald, none has been found who definitely observed
Jack Ruby’s entry into the basement. After considering all the evidence,
the Commission has concluded that Ruby entered the basement
unaided, probably via the Main Street ramp, and no more than 3
minutes before the shooting of Oswald.</p>

<p>Ruby’s account of how he entered the basement by the Main Street
ramp merits consideration in determining his means of entry. Three
Dallas policemen testified that approximately 30 minutes after his
arrest, Ruby told them that he had walked to the top of the Main
Street ramp from the nearby Western Union office and that he walked
down the ramp at the time the police car driven by Lieutenant Pierce
emerged into Main Street.<a id="FNanchor_C5-139" href="#Footnote_C5-139" class="fnanchor">C5-139</a> This information did not come to light
immediately because the policemen did not report it to their superiors
until some days later.<a id="FNanchor_C5-140" href="#Footnote_C5-140" class="fnanchor">C5-140</a> Ruby refused to discuss his means of entry
in interrogations with other investigators later on the day of his
arrest.<a id="FNanchor_C5-141" href="#Footnote_C5-141" class="fnanchor">C5-141</a> Thereafter, in a lengthy interview on December 21 and in
a sworn deposition taken after his trial, Ruby gave the same explanation
he had given to the three policemen.<a id="FNanchor_C5-142" href="#Footnote_C5-142" class="fnanchor">C5-142</a></p>

<p>The Commission has been able to establish with precision the time
of certain events leading up to the shooting. Minutes before Oswald
appeared in the basement, Ruby was in the Western Union office
located on the same block of Main Street some 350 feet from the top
of the Main Street ramp. The time stamp on a money order which
he sent and on the receipt found in his pocket establish that the order
was accepted for transmission at almost exactly 11:17 a.m. Ruby
was then observed to depart the office walking in the direction of the
police building.<a id="FNanchor_C5-143" href="#Footnote_C5-143" class="fnanchor">C5-143</a> Video tapes taken without interruption before the
shooting establish that Lieutenant Pierce’s car cleared the crowd at
the foot of the ramp 55 seconds before the shooting. They also show
Ruby standing at the foot of the ramp on the Main Street side before
the shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C5-144" href="#Footnote_C5-144" class="fnanchor">C5-144</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 2635, <a href="#Page_220">p. 220</a>.) The
shooting occurred very close to 11:21 a.m. This time has been established
by observing the time on a clock appearing in motion pictures
of Oswald in the basement jail office, and by records giving the time
of Oswald’s departure from the city jail and the time at which an
ambulance was summoned for Oswald.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span><a id="FNanchor_C5-145" href="#Footnote_C5-145" class="fnanchor">C5-145</a></p>

<div id="ip_220" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.6875em;">

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Commission Exhibit No. 2635</span></p>

<p>Ruby in basement (extreme right) immediately before shooting (Sunday, November 24).</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
The Main Street ramp provided the most direct route to the basement
from the Western Union office. At normal stride, it requires
approximately 1 minute to walk from that office to the top of the
Main Street ramp and about 20-25 seconds to descend the ramp.<a id="FNanchor_C5-146" href="#Footnote_C5-146" class="fnanchor">C5-146</a>
It is certain, therefore, that Ruby entered the basement no more than
2-3 minutes before the shooting. This timetable indicates that a
little more than 2 of the 4 minutes between Ruby’s departure from
the Western Union office and the time of the shooting are unaccounted
for. Ruby could have consumed this time in loitering along the way,
at the top of the ramp, or inside the basement. However, if Ruby is
correct that he passed Pierce’s car at the top of the ramp, he could
have been in the basement no more than 30 seconds before the
shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C5-147" href="#Footnote_C5-147" class="fnanchor">C5-147</a></p>

<p>The testimony of two witnesses partially corroborates Ruby’s claim
that he entered by the Main Street ramp. James Turner, an employee
of WBAP-TV Fort Worth, testified that while he was standing near
the railing on the east side of the Main Street ramp, perhaps 30 seconds
before the shooting, he observed a man he is confident was Jack
Ruby moving slowly down the Main Street ramp about 10 feet from
the bottom.<a id="FNanchor_C5-148" href="#Footnote_C5-148" class="fnanchor">C5-148</a> Two other witnesses testified that they thought they
had seen Ruby on the Main Street side of the ramp before the
shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C5-149" href="#Footnote_C5-149" class="fnanchor">C5-149</a></p>

<p>One other witness has testified regarding the purported movements
of a man on the Main Street ramp, but his testimony merits little
credence. A former police officer, N. J. Daniels, who was standing
at the top of the ramp with the single patrolman guarding this entrance,
R. E. Vaughn, testified that “3 or 4 minutes, I guess”<a id="FNanchor_C5-150" href="#Footnote_C5-150" class="fnanchor">C5-150</a> before
the shooting, a man walked down the Main Street ramp in full view
of Vaughn but was not stopped or questioned by the officer. Daniels
did not identify the man as Ruby. Moreover, he gave a description
which differed in important respects from Ruby’s appearance on
November 24, and he has testified that he doesn’t think the man was
Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C5-151" href="#Footnote_C5-151" class="fnanchor">C5-151</a> On November 24, Vaughn telephoned Daniels to ask him
if he had seen anybody walk past him on the morning of the 24th
and was told that he had not; it was not until November 29 that
Daniels came forward with the statement that he had seen a man
enter.<a id="FNanchor_C5-152" href="#Footnote_C5-152" class="fnanchor">C5-152</a></p>

<p>Although the sum of this evidence tends to support Ruby’s claim
that he entered by the Main Street ramp, there is other evidence not
fully consistent with Ruby’s story. Patrolman Vaughn stated that
he checked the credentials of all unknown persons seeking to enter
the basement, and his testimony was supported by several persons.<a id="FNanchor_C5-153" href="#Footnote_C5-153" class="fnanchor">C5-153</a>
Vaughn denied that the emergence of Lieutenant Pierce’s car from
the building distracted him long enough to allow Ruby to enter the
ramp unnoticed, and neither he nor any of the three officers in Lieutenant
Pierce’s car saw Ruby enter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span><a id="FNanchor_C5-154" href="#Footnote_C5-154" class="fnanchor">C5-154</a></p>

<p>Despite Vaughn’s denial the Commission has found no credible evidence
to support any other entry route. Two Dallas detectives believed
they observed three men pushing a WBAP-TV camera into the
basement minutes before the shooting, while only two were with the
camera after Oswald had been shot.<a id="FNanchor_C5-155" href="#Footnote_C5-155" class="fnanchor">C5-155</a> However, films taken in the
basement show the WBAP-TV camera being pushed past the detectives
by only two men.<a id="FNanchor_C5-156" href="#Footnote_C5-156" class="fnanchor">C5-156</a> The suspicion of the detectives is probably
explained by testimony that a third WBAP-TV employee ran to help
steady the incoming camera as it entered the basement, probably just
before the camera became visible on the films.<a id="FNanchor_C5-157" href="#Footnote_C5-157" class="fnanchor">C5-157</a> Moreover, since the
camera entered the basement close to 4 minutes before the shooting,<a id="FNanchor_C5-158" href="#Footnote_C5-158" class="fnanchor">C5-158</a>
it is virtually impossible that Ruby could have been in the basement
at that time.</p>

<p>The possibility that Ruby entered the basement by some other route
has been investigated, but the Commission has found no evidence to
support it. Ruby could have walked from the Western Union office
to the Commerce Street ramp on the other side of the building in about
2½ minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C5-159" href="#Footnote_C5-159" class="fnanchor">C5-159</a> However, during the minutes preceding the shooting
video tapes show the armored truck in the entranceway to this ramp
with only narrow clearance on either side. (See Commission Exhibit
No. 2710, <a href="#Page_223">p. 223</a>.) Several policemen were standing near the truck
and a large crowd of spectators was gathered across the street.<a id="FNanchor_C5-160" href="#Footnote_C5-160" class="fnanchor">C5-160</a> It
is improbable that Ruby could have squeezed past the truck without
having been observed. If Ruby entered by any other means, he would
have had to pass first through the Police and Courts Building or the
attached Municipal Building, and then secondly through one of the
five doors into the basement, all of which, according to the testimony
of police officers, were secured. The testimony was not completely
positive about one of the doors.<a id="FNanchor_C5-161" href="#Footnote_C5-161" class="fnanchor">C5-161</a></p>

<p>There is no evidence to support the speculations that Ruby used
a press badge to gain entry to the basement or that he concealed himself
in a police car. Police found no form of press card on Ruby’s
person after his apprehension, nor any discarded badges within the
basement.<a id="FNanchor_C5-162" href="#Footnote_C5-162" class="fnanchor">C5-162</a> There is no evidence that any police officer admitted
Ruby on the pretense that he was a member of the press or any other
pretense.<a id="FNanchor_C5-163" href="#Footnote_C5-163" class="fnanchor">C5-163</a></p>

<p>Police vehicles in the basement were inspected during the course
of the search supervised by Sergeant Dean.<a id="FNanchor_C5-164" href="#Footnote_C5-164" class="fnanchor">C5-164</a> According to Patrolman
Vaughn, the only vehicles that entered the basement while he
was at the top of the Main Street ramp were two patrol cars, one of
which entered twice, and a patrol wagon which was searched by another
policeman after it entered the basement. All entered on official
police business and considerably more than 4 minutes before Oswald
was shot.<a id="FNanchor_C5-165" href="#Footnote_C5-165" class="fnanchor">C5-165</a> None of the witnesses at the top of the Main Street ramp
recalled any police car entering the basement in the 4-minute period
after Ruby left the Western Union office and preceding the shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C5-166" href="#Footnote_C5-166" class="fnanchor">C5-166</a>
The possibility that Ruby could have entered the basement in a car
may therefore be completely discounted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
The Dallas Police Department, concerned at the failure of its
security measures, conducted an extensive investigation that revealed
no information indicating complicity between any police officer and
Jack Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C5-167" href="#Footnote_C5-167" class="fnanchor">C5-167</a> Ruby denied to the Commission that he received any
form of assistance.<a id="FNanchor_C5-168" href="#Footnote_C5-168" class="fnanchor">C5-168</a> The FBI interviewed every member of the
police department who was on duty in the basement on November 24,
and Commission staff members took sworn depositions from many.
With few exceptions, newsmen who were present in the basement at
the time also gave statements and/or depositions. As the record before
the Commission indicated, Ruby had had rather free access to the
Dallas police quarters during the period subsequent to the assassination,
but there was no evidence that implicated the police or newsmen
in Ruby’s actions on that day.<a id="FNanchor_C5-169" href="#Footnote_C5-169" class="fnanchor">C5-169</a></p>

<p>Ruby was known to have a wide acquaintanceship with Dallas
policemen and to seek their favor. According to testimony from
many sources, he gave free coffee at his clubs to many policemen
while they were on duty and free admittance and discounts on beverages
when they were off duty.<a id="FNanchor_C5-170" href="#Footnote_C5-170" class="fnanchor">C5-170</a> Although Chief Curry’s estimate
that approximately 25 to 50 of the 1,175 men in the Dallas Police
Department knew Ruby<a id="FNanchor_C5-171" href="#Footnote_C5-171" class="fnanchor">C5-171</a> may be too conservative, the Commission
found no evidence of any suspicious relationships between Ruby and
any police officer.</p>

<p>The Commission found no substantial evidence that any member of
the Dallas Police Department recognized Jack Ruby as an unauthorized
person in the basement prior to the time Sgt. P. T. Dean, according
to his testimony, saw Ruby dart forward toward Oswald. But Dean
was then part way up the Commerce Street ramp, too far removed to
act.<a id="FNanchor_C5-172" href="#Footnote_C5-172" class="fnanchor">C5-172</a> Patrolman W. J. Harrison, Capt. Glen King, and reserve
officers Capt. C. O. Arnett and Patrolman W. M. Croy were among
those in front of Ruby at the time Dean saw him. They all faced
away from Ruby, toward the jail office.<a id="FNanchor_C5-173" href="#Footnote_C5-173" class="fnanchor">C5-173</a> Video tapes show that
Harrison turned in the direction of the ramp at the time Lieutenant
Pierce’s car passed, and once again 25 seconds later, but there is no
indication that he observed or recognized Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C5-174" href="#Footnote_C5-174" class="fnanchor">C5-174</a> The policemen
standing on the south side of the passageway from the jail office, who
might have been looking in Ruby’s direction, had the glare of television
and photographer’s lights in their eyes.<a id="FNanchor_C5-175" href="#Footnote_C5-175" class="fnanchor">C5-175</a></p>

<p>The Commission also considered the possibility that a member of
the police department called Ruby at his apartment and informed
him, either intentionally or unintentionally, of the time of the
planned transfer. From at least 10:19 a.m., until close to 11 a.m.,
on Sunday, Ruby was at his apartment,<a id="FNanchor_C5-176" href="#Footnote_C5-176" class="fnanchor">C5-176</a> where he could have received
a call that the transfer was imminent. He apparently left his apartment
between 10:45 and 11 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_C5-177" href="#Footnote_C5-177" class="fnanchor">C5-177</a> However, the drive from Ruby’s
apartment to the Western Union office takes approximately 15 minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C5-178" href="#Footnote_C5-178" class="fnanchor">C5-178</a>
Since the time of the contemplated transfer could not
have been known to anyone until a few minutes before 11:15
a.m., a precise time could not have been conveyed to Ruby while he
was at his apartment. Moreover, the television and radio publicized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
the transfer plans throughout the morning, obviating the need for
Ruby to obtain information surreptitiously.</p>

<h3 id="hdr116">ADEQUACY OF SECURITY PRECAUTIONS</h3>

<p>The shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald obviously resulted from the failure
of the security precautions which the Dallas Police Department had
taken to protect their prisoner. In assessing the causes of the security
failure, the Commission has not overlooked the extraordinary circumstances
which prevailed during the days that the attention of the
world was turned on Dallas. Confronted with a unique situation, the
Dallas police took special security measures to insure Oswald’s safety.
Unfortunately these did not include adequate control of the great
crowd of newsmen that inundated the police department building.</p>

<p>The Dallas police had in custody a man whose alleged act had
brought upon him immediate and universal opprobrium. There were
many possible reasons why people might have attempted to kill him
if given the opportunity. Concerned that there might be an attempt
on Oswald’s life, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover sent a message to
Chief Curry on November 22 through Special Agent Manning C.
Clements of the FBI’s Dallas office, urging that Oswald be afforded the
utmost security. Curry does not recall receiving the message.<a id="FNanchor_C5-179" href="#Footnote_C5-179" class="fnanchor">C5-179</a></p>

<p>Although the presence of a great mass of press representatives
created an extraordinary security problem in the building, the police
department pursued its normal policy of admitting the press. That
policy, set forth in General Order No. 81 of the Dallas Police Department,
<span class="locked">provided—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * that members of this Department render every assistance,
except such as obviously may seriously hinder or delay the proper
functioning of the Department, to the accredited members of
the official news-gathering agencies and this includes newspaper,
television cameramen and news-reel photographers.<a id="FNanchor_C5-180" href="#Footnote_C5-180" class="fnanchor">C5-180</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In a letter to all members of the police department, dated February 7,
1963, Chief Curry explained the general order, in part, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The General Order covering this subject is not merely permissive.
It does not state that the Officer may, if he so chooses, assist
the press. It rather places on him a responsibility to lend active
assistance.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>* * * as a Department we deal with public affairs. It is the
right of the public to know about these affairs, and one of the
most accurate and useful avenues we have of supplying this information
is through the newspapers and radio and television
stations.</p>

<p>Implied in the General Order is a prohibition for the Officer to
improperly attempt to interfere with the news media representative,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
who is functioning in his capacity as such. Such activity
on the part of any Police Officer is regarded by the press as
an infringement of rights, and the Department shares this
view.<a id="FNanchor_C5-181" href="#Footnote_C5-181" class="fnanchor">C5-181</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Under this policy, news representatives ordinarily had access
to the Police and Courts Building. The first newsmen to arrive on
Friday afternoon were admitted in accordance with the policy; others
who came later simply followed behind them. Shortly after Oswald
arrived, Captain King granted permission to bring television cameras
to the third floor.<a id="FNanchor_C5-182" href="#Footnote_C5-182" class="fnanchor">C5-182</a> By the time the unwieldy proportions of the
crowd of newsmen became apparent, it had already become well entrenched
on the third floor. No one suggested reversing the department’s
policy expressed in General Order No. 81. Chief Curry testified
that at no time did he consider clearing the crowd from the
building; he “saw no particular harm in allowing the media to observe
the prisoner.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-183" href="#Footnote_C5-183" class="fnanchor">C5-183</a> Captain King later stated candidly that he simply
became “accustomed to the idea of them being out there.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-184" href="#Footnote_C5-184" class="fnanchor">C5-184</a></p>

<p>The general policy of the Dallas police recognized that the rule of
full cooperation did not apply when it might jeopardize an investigation.<a id="FNanchor_C5-185" href="#Footnote_C5-185" class="fnanchor">C5-185</a>
In retrospect, most members of the department believed that
the general rule allowing admittance of the press to the police quarters
should not have been followed after the assassination. Few, if any,
thought this at the time.<a id="FNanchor_C5-186" href="#Footnote_C5-186" class="fnanchor">C5-186</a> By failing to exclude the press from the
building on Friday and Saturday, the Dallas police made it possible
for the uncontrolled crowd to nearly surround Oswald on the frequent
occasions that he moved through the third floor corridor. The decision
to allow newsmen to observe the transfer on Sunday followed naturally
the policy established during these first 2 days of Oswald’s detention.</p>

<p>The reporters and cameramen descended upon the third floor of
the Police and Courts Building in such numbers that the pressroom on
the third floor proved wholly inadequate. Rather than the “two or
three or maybe a half dozen reporters” who normally appeared to
cover local police stories,<a id="FNanchor_C5-187" href="#Footnote_C5-187" class="fnanchor">C5-187</a> the police were faced with upward of 100.
Bringing with them cameras, microphones, cables, and spotlights, the
newsmen inevitably spilled over into areas where they interfered with
the transaction of police business and the maintenance of security.<a id="FNanchor_C5-188" href="#Footnote_C5-188" class="fnanchor">C5-188</a></p>

<p>Aside from numbers, the gathering of reporters presented a problem
because most of them were representatives of the national and foreign
press, rather than the local press.<a id="FNanchor_C5-189" href="#Footnote_C5-189" class="fnanchor">C5-189</a> These newsmen carried individual
press cards rather than identification cards issued by the
Dallas police. Therefore, it was impossible for the police to verify
quickly the identity of this great number of unfamiliar people who
appeared almost simultaneously.<a id="FNanchor_C5-190" href="#Footnote_C5-190" class="fnanchor">C5-190</a> Because of the close physical
proximity of the milling mass of insistent newsmen to the prisoner,
the failure to authenticate press credentials subjected the prisoner
to a serious security risk.</p>

<p>Although steps were taken on Friday afternoon to insure that persons
seeking entry to the third floor were there for a legitimate purpose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
reasons could be fabricated. Moreover, because of the large
crowd, it was easier for unauthorized persons to slip by those guarding
the entrances. Jack Ruby, for one, was able to gain entry to the
third-floor corridor on Friday night.<a id="FNanchor_C5-191" href="#Footnote_C5-191" class="fnanchor">C5-191</a></p>

<p>The third-floor corridor provided the only passageway between the
homicide and robbery bureau and the jail elevator. No thought seems
to have been given, however, to the possibility of questioning Oswald
on some other floor.<a id="FNanchor_C5-192" href="#Footnote_C5-192" class="fnanchor">C5-192</a> Moreover, Oswald’s most extended exposure
to the press, at the Friday evening press conference, was unrelated to
any phase of the investigation and was motivated primarily by the
desire to satisfy the demands of the news media to see the prisoner.<a id="FNanchor_C5-193" href="#Footnote_C5-193" class="fnanchor">C5-193</a>
The risks attendant upon this appearance were emphasized by the
presence of unauthorized persons, including Jack Ruby, at the press
conference in the basement assembly room.<a id="FNanchor_C5-194" href="#Footnote_C5-194" class="fnanchor">C5-194</a></p>

<p>Although Oswald was repeatedly exposed to possible assaults on
Friday and Saturday, he met his death on Sunday, when police took
the most extensive security precautions. The assembly of more than
70 police officers, some of them armed with tear gas, and the contemplated
use of an armored truck, appear to have been designed primarily
to repel an attempt of a mob to seize the prisoner.<a id="FNanchor_C5-195" href="#Footnote_C5-195" class="fnanchor">C5-195</a> Chief
Curry’s own testimony indicated that such a focus resulted not from
any appraisal of the varied risks to Oswald’s life but came about in
response to the telephone threat Sunday morning that a hundred
men were going to attack Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C5-196" href="#Footnote_C5-196" class="fnanchor">C5-196</a></p>

<p>A more balanced appraisal would have given thought to protection
against any attack. For example, the acceptance of inadequate press
credentials posed a clear avenue for a one-man assault. The likelihood
of an unauthorized person obtaining entry by such means is
confirmed not alone by the fact that Jack Ruby managed to get by
a guard at one entrance. Several newsmen related that their credentials
were not checked as they entered the basement Sunday morning.
Seconds before Oswald was shot, the double doors from the
hallway next to the jail office afforded a means of entry to the basement
without presentation of credentials earlier demanded of newsmen.<a id="FNanchor_C5-197" href="#Footnote_C5-197" class="fnanchor">C5-197</a></p>

<p>The swarm of newspeople in the basement also substantially limited
the ability of the police to detect an unauthorized person, once he
had entered the basement. While Jack Ruby might have been easily
spotted if only police officers had been in the basement,<a id="FNanchor_C5-198" href="#Footnote_C5-198" class="fnanchor">C5-198</a> he remained
apparently unnoticed in the crowd of newsmen until he lunged forward
toward Oswald. The near-blinding television and motion picture
lights which were allowed to shine upon the escort party further
increased the difficulty of observing unusual movements in the basement.</p>

<p>Moreover, by making public the plans for the transfer, the police
attracted to the city jail many persons who otherwise might not have
learned of the move until it had been completed. This group included
the onlookers gathered on Commerce Street and a few people
on Main Street. Also, continuous television and radio coverage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
the activities in the basement might have resulted in compromise of
the transfer operation.</p>

<p>These risks to Oswald’s safety, growing in part out of adherence
to the general policy of the police department, were also accepted
for other reasons. Many members of the police department believed
that the extraordinary public attention aroused by the tragic death of
President Kennedy obliged them to make special efforts to accommodate
the press. Captain King carefully articulated one reason
why the newsmen were permitted</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * to remain in the hallways, * * * to view the investigation
and to keep in constant touch with progress of the investigation.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We realized that if we arrested a suspect, that if we brought
him into the police station and then conducted all of our investigations
behind closed doors, that if we gave no reports on the
progress of our investigation and did not permit the newsmen
to see the suspect—if we excluded them from it—we would leave
ourselves open not only to criticisms that we were fabricating
a suspect and were attempting to pin something on someone, but
even more importantly, we would cause people to lose faith in
our fairness and, through losing faith in our fairness, to lose
faith to a certain extent in the processes of law.</p>

<p>We felt it was mandatory that as many people knew about it as
possible. We knew, too, that if we did exclude the newsmen, we
would be leaving ourselves open to a charge that we were using
improper action, duress, physical abuse, all of these things.<a id="FNanchor_C5-199" href="#Footnote_C5-199" class="fnanchor">C5-199</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While Oswald was in custody, the Dallas police kept the press
informed about the treatment Oswald was receiving. The public
could have been assured that the prisoner was not mistreated and
that his rights were fully respected by the police, without each one of
hundreds of cameramen and reporters being permitted to satisfy
himself that the police had not abused the prisoner. This result could
have been accomplished by obtaining reports from members of the
family who visited him, or by a committee of the bar or other substantial
citizens of the community. When it became known on Saturday
that Oswald did not have an attorney, the president of the
Dallas Bar Association visited him to inquire whether he wished
assistance in obtaining counsel.<a id="FNanchor_C5-200" href="#Footnote_C5-200" class="fnanchor">C5-200</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the right of the public to know does not give the press
license to interfere with the efficient operation of law-enforcement
agencies. Permitting the press to remain on the third floor of the
building served no valid purpose that could not have been met if the
press had been excluded from the third floor, as it was from the fourth
and fifth floors, and informed of developments either through press
releases or at press conferences elsewhere in the building.</p>

<p>Having failed to exclude the mass of the press from the basement
during the transfer of Oswald, the police department’s security measures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
could not be completely effective. Despite the pressures that
prevailed, planning and coordination of security arrangements could
have been more thorough and precise. No single member of the
Dallas Police Department ever assumed full responsibility for the
details of Oswald’s transfer.<a id="FNanchor_C5-201" href="#Footnote_C5-201" class="fnanchor">C5-201</a> Chief Curry participated in some
of the planning, but he felt that primary authority for the transfer
should be Fritz’, since Fritz had charge of the investigation. According
to Chief <span class="locked">Curry—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fritz and I, I think, discussed this briefly, the possibility of
getting that prisoner out of the city hall during the night hours
and by another route and slipping him to the jail, but actually
Fritz was not too much in favor of this and I more or less left
this up to Fritz as to when and how this transfer would be made,
because he has in the past transferred many of his prisoners to
the county jail and I felt that since it was his responsibility, the
prisoner was, to let him decide when and how he wanted to transfer
this prisoner.<a id="FNanchor_C5-202" href="#Footnote_C5-202" class="fnanchor">C5-202</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Fritz, on the other hand, felt that Curry was directing the transfer
arrangements: “I was transferring him like the chief told me to transfer
him.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-203" href="#Footnote_C5-203" class="fnanchor">C5-203</a> When Capt. W. B. Frazier notified Fritz by telephone
early Sunday morning about the threats to Oswald’s life, Fritz replied
that Curry should be notified, since he was handling the transfer.<a id="FNanchor_C5-204" href="#Footnote_C5-204" class="fnanchor">C5-204</a>
When urged to modify the transfer plans to avoid the press,
as he later testified he would have preferred to do, Fritz declined on
the ground that Curry had already decided to the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_C5-205" href="#Footnote_C5-205" class="fnanchor">C5-205</a>
Hence, if the recollection of both officials is accurate, the basic decision
to move Oswald at an announced time and in the presence of the
news media was never carefully thought through by either man.
Curry and Fritz had agreed Saturday evening that Oswald should
not be moved at night, but their discussion apparently went little
further.<a id="FNanchor_C5-206" href="#Footnote_C5-206" class="fnanchor">C5-206</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the members of the Dallas Police Department were, as
many testified, accustomed to working together so that formal instructions
were sometimes unnecessary. On the other hand, it is clear,
at least in retrospect, that this particular occasion demanded more
than the usual informal unspoken understandings. The evidence indicates
that no member of the department at any time considered fully
the implications of moving Oswald through the basement. Nor did
any single official or group of officials coordinate and direct where
the transfer vehicle would be stationed to accept Oswald, where the
press would stand, and the number and positioning of police officers
in the basement. Captain Jones indicated that there were to be two
solid lines of policemen from the jail office door to the transfer vehicle,<a id="FNanchor_C5-207" href="#Footnote_C5-207" class="fnanchor">C5-207</a>
but lines were formed only along the walls of the areaway
between the jail office door and the ramp. The newsmen were not
kept east of the auto ramp where a railing would have separated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
them from Oswald. No strong ranks of policemen were ever placed
in front of the newsmen once they were allowed to gather in the area
of the Main Street ramp.<a id="FNanchor_C5-208" href="#Footnote_C5-208" class="fnanchor">C5-208</a> Many policemen in the basement did
not know the function they were supposed to perform. No instructions
were given that certain policemen should watch the crowd
rather than Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C5-209" href="#Footnote_C5-209" class="fnanchor">C5-209</a> Apparently no one gave any thought to the
blinding effect of television and other camera lights upon the escort
party.</p>

<p>Largely on his own initiative, Captain Talbert undertook to secure
the basement, with only minimal coordination with those responsible
for and familiar with the route Oswald would take through the basement.
Several officials recalled that Lt. Woodrow Wiggins was
directed to clear the basement jail office, but Wiggins testified that
he received no such assignment.<a id="FNanchor_C5-210" href="#Footnote_C5-210" class="fnanchor">C5-210</a> In any event, less than 20 minutes
before the transfer, Captain Jones observed newsmen in the jail
office and had them removed. But no official removed news personnel
from the corridor beside the jail office; indeed, cameramen took pictures
through the glass windows of the jail office as Oswald walked
through it toward the basement, and then approached to within 20
feet of Oswald from the rear at the same time that Jack Ruby moved
toward Oswald from the front.<a id="FNanchor_C5-211" href="#Footnote_C5-211" class="fnanchor">C5-211</a></p>

<p>A clear example of the inadequacy of coordination was the last-minute
change in plans to transfer Oswald in an unmarked police car
rather than by armored truck.<a id="FNanchor_C5-212" href="#Footnote_C5-212" class="fnanchor">C5-212</a> The plan to use an armored vehicle
was adopted without informing Fritz. When Fritz was told of the
arrangement shortly after 11 o’clock, he objected, and hurried steps
were taken to modify the arrangements. Fritz was then prematurely
informed that the basement arrangements were complete. When
Oswald and the escorting detectives entered the basement, the transfer
car had not yet been backed into position, nor had the policemen
been arranged to block the newsmen’s access to Oswald’s path.<a id="FNanchor_C5-213" href="#Footnote_C5-213" class="fnanchor">C5-213</a> If
the transfer car had been carefully positioned between the press and
Oswald, Ruby might have been kept several yards from his victim
and possibly without a clear view of him. Detective Leavelle, who
accompanied Oswald into the basement, testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * I was surprised when I walked to the door and the car was
not in the spot it should have been, but I could see it was in back,
and backing into position, but had it been in position where we
were told it would be, that would have eliminated a lot of the area
in which anyone would have access to him, because it would have
been blocked by the car. In fact, if the car had been sitting where
we were told it was going to be, see—it would have been sitting
directly upon the spot where Ruby was standing when he fired
the shot.<a id="FNanchor_C5-214" href="#Footnote_C5-214" class="fnanchor">C5-214</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Captain Jones described the confusion with which Oswald’s entry
into the basement was in fact received:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Then the change—going to put two cars up there. There is no
reason why that back car can’t get all the way back to the jail
office. The original plan would be that the line of officers would
be from the jail door to the vehicle. Then they say, “Here he
comes.” * * * It is too late to get the people out of the way of
the car and form the line. I am aware that Oswald is already
coming because of the furor, so, I was trying to keep everybody out
of the way and keep the way clear and I heard a shot.<a id="FNanchor_C5-215" href="#Footnote_C5-215" class="fnanchor">C5-215</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Therefore, regardless of whether the press should have been allowed
to witness the transfer, security measures in the basement for Oswald’s
protection could and should have been better organized and more
thorough. These additional deficiencies were directly related to the
decision to admit newsmen to the basement. The Commission concludes
that the failure of the police to remove Oswald secretly or to
control the crowd in the basement at the time of the transfer were the
major causes of the security breakdown which led to Oswald’s death.</p>

<h3 id="hdr117">NEWS COVERAGE AND POLICE POLICY</h3>

<p>Consistent with its policy of allowing news representatives to remain
within the working quarters of the Police and Courts Building,
the police department made every effort to keep the press fully informed
about the progress of the investigation. As a result, from
Friday afternoon until after the killing of Oswald on Sunday, the
press was able to publicize virtually all of the information about the
case which had been gathered until that time. In the process, a great
deal of misinformation was disseminated to a worldwide audience.
(For some examples see <a href="#APPENDIX_XII">app. XII</a>.)</p>

<p>As administrative assistant to Chief Curry, Captain King also
handled departmental press relations and issued press releases. According
to King, it was “the responsibility of each member of the
department to furnish to the press information on incidents in
which they, themselves, were involved, except on matters which involved
* * * personnel policies of the department, or * * * unless
it would obviously interfere with an investigation underway.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-216" href="#Footnote_C5-216" class="fnanchor">C5-216</a> In
Oswald’s case, Chief Curry released most of the information to the
press. He and Assistant Chief Batchelor agreed on Friday that
Curry would make all announcements to the press.<a id="FNanchor_C5-217" href="#Footnote_C5-217" class="fnanchor">C5-217</a> However, there
is no evidence that this decision was ever communicated to the rest of
the police force. The chief consequence appears to have been that
Batchelor refrained from making statements to the news media during
this period.</p>

<p>Most of the information was disclosed through informal oral statements
or answers to questions at impromptu and clamorous press conferences
in the third floor corridor. Written press releases were not
employed. The ambulatory press conference became a familiar sight
during these days. Whenever Curry or other officials appeared in the
hallway, newsmen surrounded them, asking questions and requesting
statements. Usually the officials complied. (See Commission Exhibit
No. 2632, <a href="#Page_232">p. 232</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>Press interview with Chief Curry in third floor corridor.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
Curry appeared in interviews on television and radio at least a dozen
times during November 22-24. He did not attend any of the interrogations
of Oswald in Captain Fritz’ office except at the beginning and toward
the end of Sunday morning’s session; he received his information
through Captain Fritz and other sources.<a id="FNanchor_C5-218" href="#Footnote_C5-218" class="fnanchor">C5-218</a> Nevertheless, in sessions
with the newsmen on Friday and Saturday he gave detailed information
on the progress of the case against Oswald. Recorded statements
of television and radio interviews with Curry and other officials in
Dallas during November 22-24 have been transcribed and included
in the record compiled by the Commission.<a id="FNanchor_C5-219" href="#Footnote_C5-219" class="fnanchor">C5-219</a> An example of these
interviews is the following transcript of remarks made by Curry to
newsmen on Saturday:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Q. Chief Curry, I understand you have some new information
in this case. Could you relate what that is?</p>

<p>A. Yes, we’ve just been informed by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, that they, the FBI, have the order letter from
a mail order house, and the order was sent to their laboratory in
Washington and the writing on this order was compared with
known samples of our suspect, Oswald’s handwriting and found
to be the same.</p>

<p>Q. This order was for the rifle?</p>

<p>A. This order was for the rifle to a mail order house in Chicago.
It was [inaudible]. The return address was to Dallas, Texas, to
the post office box under the name of A. Hidell, H-I-D-E-double L.
This is the post office box of our suspect. This gun was mailed
parcel post March 20, 1963. I understand he left Dallas shortly
after this and didn’t come back until I think about two months
ago.</p>

<p>Q. Do you know again on what date this rifle was ordered
and are you able to link it definitely as the rifle which you confiscated
at the School Book Depository?</p>

<p>A. That we have not done so far. If the FBI has been able to
do it I have not been informed of it yet. We do know that this
man ordered a rifle of the type that was used in the assassination
of the President from this mail order house in Chicago and the
FBI has definitely identified the writing as that of our suspect.</p>

<p>Q. On another subject—I understand you have photographs
of the suspect, Oswald, with a rifle like that used. Could you
describe that picture?</p>

<p>A. This is the picture of Oswald standing facing a camera
with a rifle in his hand which is very similar to the rifle that we
have in our possession. He also had a pistol strapped on his
hip. He was holding two papers in his hand, with one of them
seemed to be The Worker and the other says Be Militant—I don’t
know whether that was headlines or the name of the paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
Q. How much did the gun cost from the mail order house?</p>

<p>A. I understand the gun was advertised for $12.78, I believe.</p>

<p>Q. Have you received any results on the ballistics test conducted
on the gun and on Oswald?</p>

<p>A. They’re going to be favorable. I don’t have a formal report
yet.</p>

<p>Q. But you are sure at this time they will be favorable?</p>

<p>A. Yes.</p>

<p>Q. Do you feel now that you have the case completely wrapped
up, or are you continuing?</p>

<p>A. We will continue as long as there is a shred of evidence
to be gathered. We have a strong case at this time.</p>

<p>Q. I believe you said earlier this afternoon that you have a
new development which does wrap up the case—the first time you
said the case definitely is secure. Is that correct?</p>

<p>A. That was this morning. This additional evidence just makes
a stronger case.</p>

<p>Q. But this is not the same evidence you were referring to then?</p>

<p>A. No, that’s true.</p>

<p>Q. Would you be willing to say what that evidence was?</p>

<p>A. No, sir. I don’t wish to reveal it. It might jeopardize our
case.</p>

<p>Commentator: Thank you very much Chief Jesse Curry of the
Dallas Police Department.<a id="FNanchor_C5-220" href="#Footnote_C5-220" class="fnanchor">C5-220</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Although Captain Fritz permitted himself to be interviewed by
the news media less frequently than did Chief Curry, he nevertheless
answered questions and ventured opinions about the progress of the
investigation. On Saturday he told reporters that he was convinced
beyond a doubt that Oswald had killed the President. He discussed
some of the evidence in the case, especially the rifle, but his contribution
to the knowledge of the reporters was small compared with that
of Chief Curry.<a id="FNanchor_C5-221" href="#Footnote_C5-221" class="fnanchor">C5-221</a></p>

<p>Many other members of the police department, including high officials,
detectives, and patrolmen, were also interviewed by news representatives
during these days.<a id="FNanchor_C5-222" href="#Footnote_C5-222" class="fnanchor">C5-222</a> Some of these men had participated
in specific aspects of the case, such as the capture of Oswald at the
Texas Theatre and the search for evidence at the Texas School Book
Depository Building. Few, if any, seemed reluctant to submit to
questions and to being televised. It seemed to District Attorney
Wade that the newsmen “just followed everybody everywhere they
went * * * they interviewed some of your patrolmen * * * on
the corner * * * they were interviewing anybody.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-223" href="#Footnote_C5-223" class="fnanchor">C5-223</a></p>

<p>Wade himself also made several statements to the press. He
visited police headquarters twice on Friday, twice on Saturday,
and twice on Sunday. On most of these occasions he was interviewed
by the press and appeared on television.<a id="FNanchor_C5-224" href="#Footnote_C5-224" class="fnanchor">C5-224</a> After Oswald
had appeared before the press on Friday night, Wade held an impromptu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
conference with reporters in the overflowing assembly
room.<a id="FNanchor_C5-225" href="#Footnote_C5-225" class="fnanchor">C5-225</a> Wade told the press on Saturday that he would not reveal
any evidence because it might prejudice the selection of a jury.<a id="FNanchor_C5-226" href="#Footnote_C5-226" class="fnanchor">C5-226</a> On
other occasions, however, he mentioned some items of evidence and
expressed his opinions regarding Oswald’s guilt. He told the press
on Friday night that Oswald’s wife had told the police that her husband
had a rifle in the garage at the house in Irving and that it was
missing the morning of the assassination. On one occasion he repeated
the error that the murder rifle had been a Mauser. Another time, he
stated his belief that Oswald had prepared for the assassination
months in advance, including what he would tell the police. He also
said that Oswald had practiced with the rifle to improve his marksmanship.<a id="FNanchor_C5-227" href="#Footnote_C5-227" class="fnanchor">C5-227</a></p>

<p>The running commentary on the investigation by the police inevitably
carried with it the disclosure of many details that proved to be
erroneous. In their efforts to keep the public abreast of the investigation,
the police reported hearsay items and unverified leads; further
investigation proved many of these to be incorrect or inaccurate.
For example, the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School
Book Depository Building was initially identified as a Mauser 7.65
rather than a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5 because a deputy constable
who was one of the first to see it thought it looked like a Mauser. He
neither handled the weapon nor saw it at close range.<a id="FNanchor_C5-228" href="#Footnote_C5-228" class="fnanchor">C5-228</a></p>

<p>Police sources were also responsible for the mistaken notion that
the chicken bones found on the sixth floor were the remains of Oswald’s
lunch. They had in fact been left by another employee who
ate his lunch there at least 15 minutes before the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C5-229" href="#Footnote_C5-229" class="fnanchor">C5-229</a>
Curry repeated the erroneous report that a Negro had picked up
Oswald near the scene of the assassination and driven him across
town.<a id="FNanchor_C5-230" href="#Footnote_C5-230" class="fnanchor">C5-230</a> It was also reported that the map found in Oswald’s room
contained a marked route of the Presidential motorcade when it actually
contained markings of places where Oswald may have applied
for jobs, including, of course, the Texas School Book Depository.<a id="FNanchor_C5-231" href="#Footnote_C5-231" class="fnanchor">C5-231</a></p>

<p>Concern about the effects of the unlimited disclosures was being
voiced by Saturday morning. According to District Attorney
Wade, he received calls from lawyers in Dallas and elsewhere
expressing concern about providing an attorney for Oswald and about
the amount of information being given to the press by the police and
the district attorney.<a id="FNanchor_C5-232" href="#Footnote_C5-232" class="fnanchor">C5-232</a> Curry continued to answer questions on
television and radio during the remainder of the day and Sunday
morning.<a id="FNanchor_C5-233" href="#Footnote_C5-233" class="fnanchor">C5-233</a></p>

<p>FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover became concerned because “almost
as soon as * * * [FBI Laboratory reports] would reach the Dallas
Police Department, the chief of police or one of the representatives of
the department would go on TV or radio and relate findings of the
FBI, giving information such as the identification of the gun and
other items of physical evidence.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-234" href="#Footnote_C5-234" class="fnanchor">C5-234</a> On Sunday, after Oswald was
shot, Hoover dispatched a personal message to Curry requesting him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
“not to go on the air any more until this case * * * [is] resolved.”
Hoover testified later that Curry agreed not to make any more
statements.<a id="FNanchor_C5-235" href="#Footnote_C5-235" class="fnanchor">C5-235</a></p>

<p>The shooting of Oswald shocked the Dallas police, and after the
interviews that immediately followed the shooting they were disposed
to remain silent. Chief Curry made only one more television appearance
after the shooting. At 1:30 p.m., he descended to the assembly
room where, tersely and grimly, he announced Oswald’s death. He
refused to answer any of the questions shouted at him by the persistent
reporters, concluding the conference in less than a minute.<a id="FNanchor_C5-236" href="#Footnote_C5-236" class="fnanchor">C5-236</a></p>

<p>District Attorney Wade also held one more press conference.
Before doing so on Sunday evening, he returned once more to the
police station and held a meeting with “all the brass” except Curry.
Wade told them that “people are saying * * * you had the wrong
man and you all were the one who killed him or let him out here to
have him killed intentionally.” Wade told the police that “somebody
ought to go out in television and lay out the evidence that you had on
Oswald, and tell them everything.” He sat down and listed from
memory items of evidence in the case against Oswald. According to
Wade, Chief Curry refused to make any statements because he had
told an FBI inspector that he would say no more. The police refused
to furnish Wade with additional details of the case.<a id="FNanchor_C5-237" href="#Footnote_C5-237" class="fnanchor">C5-237</a></p>

<p>Wade nonetheless proceeded to hold a lengthy formal press conference
that evening, in which he attempted to list all of the evidence
that had been accumulated at that point tending to establish Oswald
as the assassin of President Kennedy. Unfortunately, at that time,
as he subsequently testified, he lacked a thorough grasp of the evidence
and made a number of errors.<a id="FNanchor_C5-238" href="#Footnote_C5-238" class="fnanchor">C5-238</a> He stated that Oswald had
told a woman on a bus that the President had been killed, an error
apparently caused by the busdriver having confused Oswald with
another passenger who was on the bus after Oswald had left. Wade
also repeated the error about Oswald’s having a map marked with the
route of the motorcade. He told reporters that Oswald’s description
and name “went out by the police to look for him.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-239" href="#Footnote_C5-239" class="fnanchor">C5-239</a> The police
never mentioned Oswald’s name in their broadcast descriptions before
his arrest.<a id="FNanchor_C5-240" href="#Footnote_C5-240" class="fnanchor">C5-240</a></p>

<p>Wade was innocent of one error imputed to him since November 24.
The published transcript of part of the press conference furnished
to newspapers by the Associated Press represented Wade
as having identified the cabdriver who took Oswald to North Beckley
Avenue after the shooting, as one named “Darryl Click.” The transcript
as it appeared in the New York Times and the Washington
Post of November 26, reads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A. [Wade] a lady. He then—the bus, he asked the bus driver
to stop, got off at a stop, caught a taxicab driver, Darryl Click. I
don’t have his exact place—and went to his home in Oak Cliff,
changed his clothes hurriedly, and left.<a id="FNanchor_C5-241" href="#Footnote_C5-241" class="fnanchor">C5-241</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
The correct transcript of the press conference, taken from an audio
tape supplied by station WBAP, Fort Worth, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A. [Wade] A lady. He then—the bus, he asked the bus driver
to stop, got off at a stop, caught a taxicab driver.</p>

<p>Q. Where?</p>

<p>A. In Oak Cliff. I don’t have the exact place—and went to
his home in Oak Cliff, changed his clothes hurriedly and left.<a id="FNanchor_C5-242" href="#Footnote_C5-242" class="fnanchor">C5-242</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In this manner, a section of Dallas, “Oak Cliff,” became a nonexistent
taxicab driver, “Darryl Click.” Wade did not mention the
cabdriver by name at any time. In transcribing the conference from
the sound tape, a stenographer apparently made an error that might
have become permanently imbedded in the literature of the event but
for the preservation and use of an original sound tape.</p>

<p>Though many of the inaccuracies were subsequently corrected by
the police and are negated by findings of the Commission included
elsewhere in this report, the publicizing of unchecked information
provided much of the basis for the myths and rumors that came into
being soon after the President’s death. The erroneous disclosures
became the basis for distorted reconstruction and interpretations of
the assassination. The necessity for the Dallas authorities to correct
themselves or to be corrected by other sources gave rise not only to
criticism of the police department’s competence but also to doubts regarding
the veracity of the police. Skeptics sought to cast doubt on
much of the correct evidence later developed and to find support for
their own theories in these early police statements.</p>

<p>The immediate disclosure of information by the police created a
further risk of injuring innocent citizens by unfavorable publicity.
This was the unfortunate experience of Joe R. Molina, a Dallas-born
Navy veteran who had been employed by the Texas School Book Depository
since 1947 and on November 22, 1963, held the position of
credit manager. Apparently because of Molina’s employment at the
Depository and his membership in a veterans’ organization, the
American G.I. Forum, that the Dallas police considered possibly
subversive, Dallas policemen searched Molina’s home with his
permission, at about 1:30 a.m., Saturday, November 23. During the
day Molina was intermittently interrogated at police headquarters for
6 or 7 hours, chiefly about his membership in the American G.I.
Forum, and also about Oswald. He was never arrested, charged, or
held in custody.<a id="FNanchor_C5-243" href="#Footnote_C5-243" class="fnanchor">C5-243</a></p>

<p>While Molina was being questioned, officials of the police department
made statements or answered questions<a id="FNanchor_C5-244" href="#Footnote_C5-244" class="fnanchor">C5-244</a> that provided
the basis for television reports about Molina during the day.
These reports spoke of a “second suspect being picked up,” insinuated
that the Dallas police had reason to suspect another person who worked
in the Texas School Book Depository, stated that the suspect had been
arrested and his home searched, and mentioned that Molina may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
been identified by the U.S. Department of Justice as a possible
subversive.<a id="FNanchor_C5-245" href="#Footnote_C5-245" class="fnanchor">C5-245</a></p>

<p>No evidence was ever presented to link Molina with Oswald except
as a fellow employee of the Texas School Book Depository. According
to Molina, he had never spoken to Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C5-246" href="#Footnote_C5-246" class="fnanchor">C5-246</a> The FBI notified
the Commission that Molina had never been the subject of an investigation
by it and that it had never given any information about Molina
to the Dallas police concerning any alleged subversive activities by
him.<a id="FNanchor_C5-247" href="#Footnote_C5-247" class="fnanchor">C5-247</a> The Dallas police explained in a statement to the FBI that
they had never had a file on Molina, but that they did have one on
the American G.I. Forum.<a id="FNanchor_C5-248" href="#Footnote_C5-248" class="fnanchor">C5-248</a></p>

<p>Molina lost his job in December. He felt that he was being discharged
because of the unfavorable publicity he had received, but
officials of the Depository claimed that automation was the reason.
Molina testified that he had difficulty in finding another position,
until finally, with the help of a fellow church member, he secured a
position at a lower salary than his previous one.<a id="FNanchor_C5-249" href="#Footnote_C5-249" class="fnanchor">C5-249</a></p>

<p>If Oswald had been tried for his murders of November 22, the effects
of the news policy pursued by the Dallas authorities would have
proven harmful both to the prosecution and the defense. The misinformation
reported after the shootings might have been used by
the defense to cast doubt on the reliability of the State’s entire case.
Though each inaccuracy can be explained without great difficulty, the
number and variety of misstatements issued by the police shortly after
the assassination would have greatly assisted a skillful defense attorney
attempting to influence the attitudes of jurors.</p>

<p>A fundamental objection to the news policy pursued by the Dallas
police, however, is the extent to which it endangered Oswald’s constitutional
right to a trial by an impartial jury. Because of the
nature of the crime, the widespread attention which it necessarily received,
and the intense public feelings which it aroused, it would have
been a most difficult task to select an unprejudiced jury, either in
Dallas or elsewhere. But the difficulty was markedly increased by
the divulgence of the specific items of evidence with which the police
linked Oswald to the two killings. The disclosure of evidence encouraged
the public, from which a jury would ultimately be impaneled,
to prejudge the very questions that would be raised at trial.</p>

<p>Moreover, rules of law might have prevented the prosecution from
presenting portions of this evidence to the jury. For example, though
expressly recognizing that Oswald’s wife could not be compelled to
testify against him, District Attorney Wade revealed to the Nation
that Marina Oswald had affirmed her husband’s ownership of a rifle
like that found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.<a id="FNanchor_C5-250" href="#Footnote_C5-250" class="fnanchor">C5-250</a>
Curry stated that Oswald had refused to take a lie
detector test, although such a statement would have been inadmissible
in a trial.<a id="FNanchor_C5-251" href="#Footnote_C5-251" class="fnanchor">C5-251</a> The exclusion of such evidence, however, would
have been meaningless if jurors were already familiar with the same
facts from previous television or newspaper reports. Wade might
have influenced prospective jurors by his mistaken statement that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
the paraffin test showed that Oswald had fired a gun. The tests merely
showed that he had nitrate traces on his hands, which did not necessarily
mean that he had fired either a rifle or a pistol.<a id="FNanchor_C5-252" href="#Footnote_C5-252" class="fnanchor">C5-252</a></p>

<p>The disclosure of evidence was seriously aggravated by the statements
of numerous responsible officials that they were certain of
Oswald’s guilt. Captain Fritz said that the case against Oswald was
“cinched.” Curry reported on Saturday that “we are sure of our
case.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-253" href="#Footnote_C5-253" class="fnanchor">C5-253</a> Curry announced that he considered Oswald sane, and
Wade told the public that he would ask for the death penalty.<a id="FNanchor_C5-254" href="#Footnote_C5-254" class="fnanchor">C5-254</a></p>

<p>The American Bar Association declared in December 1963 that
“widespread publicizing of Oswald’s alleged guilt, involving statements
by officials and public disclosures of the details of ‘evidence,’
would have made it extremely difficult to impanel an unprejudiced
jury and afford the accused a fair trial.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-255" href="#Footnote_C5-255" class="fnanchor">C5-255</a> Local bar associations
expressed similar feelings.<a id="FNanchor_C5-256" href="#Footnote_C5-256" class="fnanchor">C5-256</a> The Commission agrees that Lee Harvey
Oswald’s opportunity for a trial by 12 jurors free of preconception
as to his guilt or innocence would have been seriously jeopardized
by the premature disclosure and weighing of the evidence against
him.</p>

<p>The problem of disclosure of information and its effect on trials is,
of course, further complicated by the independent activities of the
press in developing information on its own from sources other than
law enforcement agencies. Had the police not released the specific
items of evidence against Oswald, it is still possible that the other
information presented on television and in the newspapers, chiefly
of a biographical nature, would itself have had a prejudicial effect
on the public.</p>

<p>In explanation of the news policy adopted by the Dallas authorities,
Chief Curry observed that “it seemed like there was a great demand
by the general public to know what was going on.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-257" href="#Footnote_C5-257" class="fnanchor">C5-257</a> In a prepared
statement, Captain King wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At that time we felt a necessity for permitting the newsmen
as much latitude as possible. We realized the magnitude of the
incident the newsmen were there to cover. We realized that not
only the nation but the world would be greatly interested in what
occurred in Dallas. We believed that we had an obligation to
make as widely known as possible everything we could regarding
the investigation of the assassination and the manner in which
we undertook that investigation.<a id="FNanchor_C5-258" href="#Footnote_C5-258" class="fnanchor">C5-258</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Commission recognizes that the people of the United States,
and indeed the world, had a deep-felt interest in learning of the events
surrounding the death of President Kennedy, including the development
of the investigation in Dallas. An informed public provided
the ultimate guarantee that adequate steps would be taken to apprehend
those responsible for the assassination and that all necessary
precautions would be taken to protect the national security. It was
therefore proper and desirable that the public know which agencies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
were participating in the investigation and the rate at which their
work was progressing. The public was also entitled to know that
Lee Harvey Oswald had been apprehended and that the State had
gathered sufficient evidence to arraign him for the murders of the
President and Patrolman Tippit, that he was being held pending
action of the grand jury, that the investigation was continuing, and
that the law enforcement agencies had discovered no evidence which
tended to show that any other person was involved in either slaying.</p>

<p>However, neither the press nor the public had a right to
be contemporaneously informed by the police or prosecuting authorities
of the details of the evidence being accumulated against Oswald.
Undoubtedly the public was interested in these disclosures, but its
curiosity should not have been satisfied at the expense of the accused’s
right to a trial by an impartial jury. The courtroom, not the newspaper
or television screen, is the appropriate forum in our system
for the trial of a man accused of a crime.</p>

<p>If the evidence in the possession of the authorities had not been
disclosed, it is true that the public would not have been in a position
to assess the adequacy of the investigation or to apply pressures for
further official undertakings. But a major consequence of the hasty
and at times inaccurate divulgence of evidence after the assassination
was simply to give rise to groundless rumors and public confusion.
Moreover, without learning the details of the case, the public could
have been informed by the responsible authority of the general scope
of the investigation and the extent to which State and Federal
agencies were assisting in the police work.</p>

<h3 id="hdr118">RESPONSIBILITY OF NEWS MEDIA</h3>

<p>While appreciating the heavy and unique pressures with which
the Dallas Police Department was confronted by reason of the assassination
of President Kennedy, primary responsibility for having
failed to control the press and to check the flow of undigested evidence
to the public must be borne by the police department. It was
the only agency that could have established orderly and sound operating
procedures to control the multitude of newsmen gathered in
the police building after the assassination.</p>

<p>The Commission believes, however, that a part of the responsibility
for the unfortunate circumstances following the President’s death
must be borne by the news media. The crowd of newsmen generally
failed to respond properly to the demands of the police. Frequently
without permission, news representatives used police offices on the
third floor, tying up facilities and interfering with normal police
operations. Police efforts to preserve order and to clear passageways
in the corridor were usually unsuccessful. On Friday night
the reporters completely ignored Curry’s injunction against asking
Oswald questions in the assembly room and crowding in on him.
On Sunday morning, the newsmen were instructed to direct no questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
at Oswald; nevertheless, several reporters shouted questions at
him when he appeared in the basement.<a id="FNanchor_C5-259" href="#Footnote_C5-259" class="fnanchor">C5-259</a></p>

<p>Moreover, by constantly pursuing public officials, the news representatives
placed an insistent pressure, upon them to disclose information.
And this pressure was not without effect, since the police
attitude toward the press was affected by the desire to maintain satisfactory
relations with the news representatives and to create a favorable
image of themselves. Chief Curry frankly told the Commission
that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I didn’t order them out of the building, which if I had it to do
over I would. In the past like I say, we had always maintained
very good relations with our press, and they had always respected
us. * * * <a id="FNanchor_C5-260" href="#Footnote_C5-260" class="fnanchor">C5-260</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Curry refused Fritz’ request to put Oswald behind the screen in
the assembly room at the Friday night press conference because this
might have hindered the taking of pictures.<a id="FNanchor_C5-261" href="#Footnote_C5-261" class="fnanchor">C5-261</a> Curry’s subordinates
had the impression that an unannounced transfer of Oswald to the
county jail was unacceptable because Curry did not want to disappoint
the newsmen; he had promised that they could witness the transfer.<a id="FNanchor_C5-262" href="#Footnote_C5-262" class="fnanchor">C5-262</a>
It seemed clear enough that any attempt to exclude the press from
the building or to place limits on the information disclosed to them
would have been resented and disputed by the newsmen, who were
constantly and aggressively demanding all possible information about
anything related to the assassination.</p>

<p>Although the Commission has found no corroboration in the video
and audio tapes, police officials recall that one or two representatives
of the press reinforced their demands to see Oswald by suggesting
that the police had been guilty of brutalizing him. They intimated
that unless they were given the opportunity to see him, these suggestions
would be passed on to the public.<a id="FNanchor_C5-263" href="#Footnote_C5-263" class="fnanchor">C5-263</a> Captain King testified that
he had been told that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A short time after Oswald’s arrest one newsman held up a
photograph and said, “This is what the man charged with the
assassination of the President looks like. Or at least this is what
he did look like. We don’t know what he looks like after an
hour in the custody of the Dallas Police Department.”<a id="FNanchor_C5-264" href="#Footnote_C5-264" class="fnanchor">C5-264</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">City Manager Elgin Crull stated that when he visited Chief Curry in
his office on the morning of November 23, Curry told him that he “felt
it was necessary to cooperate with the news media representatives, in
order to avoid being accused of using Gestapo tactics in connection
with the handling of Oswald.” Crull agreed with Curry.<a id="FNanchor_C5-265" href="#Footnote_C5-265" class="fnanchor">C5-265</a> The Commission
deems any such veiled threats to be absolutely without
justification.</p>

<p>The general disorder in the Police and Courts Building during November
22-24 reveals a regrettable lack of self-discipline by the newsmen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
The Commission believes that the news media, as well as the
police authorities, who failed to impose conditions more in keeping
with the orderly process of justice, must share responsibility for the
failure of law enforcement which occurred in connection with the death
of Oswald. On previous occasions, public bodies have voiced the need
for the exercise of self-restraint by the news media in periods when
the demand for information must be tempered by other fundamental
requirements of our society.</p>

<p>At its annual meeting in Washington in April 1964, the American
Society of Newspaper Editors discussed the role of the press in Dallas
immediately after President Kennedy’s assassination. The discussion
revealed the strong misgivings among the editors themselves
about the role that the press had played and their desire that the press
display more self-discipline and adhere to higher standards of conduct
in the future.<a id="FNanchor_C5-266" href="#Footnote_C5-266" class="fnanchor">C5-266</a> To prevent a recurrence of the unfortunate
events which followed the assassination, however, more than general
concern will be needed. The promulgation of a code of professional
conduct governing representatives of all news media would be welcome
evidence that the press had profited by the lesson of Dallas.</p>

<p>The burden of insuring that appropriate action is taken to establish
ethical standards of conduct for the news media must also be
borne, however, by State and local governments, by the bar, and
ultimately by the public. The experience in Dallas during November
22-24 is a dramatic affirmation of the need for steps to bring about
a proper balance between the right of the public to be kept informed
and the right of the individual to a fair and impartial trial.</p>

<div id="CHAPTER_VI" class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr119" class="vspace">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="subhead">Investigation of Possible Conspiracy</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">This</span> chapter sets forth the findings of the Commission as to
whether Lee Harvey Oswald had any accomplices in the
planning or execution of the assassination. Particularly
after the slaying of Oswald by Jack Ruby under the circumstances
described in the preceding chapter, rumors and suspicions developed
regarding the existence of a conspiracy to assassinate President
Kennedy. As discussed in appendix XII, many of these rumors
were based on a lack of information as to the nature and extent
of evidence that Oswald alone fired the shots which killed President
Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally. Others of the more
widely publicized rumors maintained that Oswald must have received
aid from one or more persons or political groups, ranging
from the far left to the far right of the political spectrum, or from
a foreign government, usually either the Castro regime in Cuba
or the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The Commission faced substantial difficulties in determining
whether anyone conspired with or assisted the person who committed
the assassination. Prior to his own death Oswald had neither admitted
his own involvement nor implicated any other persons in the assassination
of the President. The problem of determining the existence or
nonexistence of a conspiracy was compounded because of the possibility
of subversive activity by a foreign power. Witnesses and evidence
located in other countries were not subject to subpena, as they would
have been if they had been located in the United States. When evidence
was obtained from a foreign nation, it could not be appraised as
effectively as if it had been derived from a domestic source. The
Commission has given the closest scrutiny to all available evidence
which related or might have related to a foreign country. All such
evidence was tested, whenever possible, against the contingency that
it had been fabricated or slanted to mislead or confuse.</p>

<p>In order to meet its obligations fully, the Commission has investigated
each rumor and allegation linking Oswald to a conspiracy which
has come to its attention, regardless of source. In addition, the Commission
has explored the details of Lee Harvey Oswald’s activities and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
life, especially in the months immediately preceding the assassination,
in order to develop any investigative lead relevant to the issue of
conspiracy. All of Oswald’s known writings or other possessions
which might have been used for code or other espionage purposes have
been examined by either the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the
National Security Agency, or both agencies, to determine whether
they were so used.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1" href="#Footnote_C6-1" class="fnanchor">C6-1</a></p>

<p>In setting forth the results of this investigation, the first section of
this chapter reviews the facts related to the assassination itself, previously
considered in more detail in chapter IV. If any conspiracy
did exist, it might have manifested itself at some point during
Oswald’s preparation for the shooting, his execution of the plan, or his
escape from the scene of the assassination. The Commission has
therefore studied the precise means by which the assassination occurred
for traces of evidence that Oswald received any form of assistance in
effecting the killing.</p>

<p>The second section of the chapter deals more broadly with Oswald’s
life since 1959. During the period following his discharge from the
Marines in 1959, Oswald engaged in several activities which demand
close scrutiny to determine whether, through these pursuits, he developed
any associations which were connected with the planning or
execution of the assassination. Oswald professed commitment to
Marxist ideology; he defected to the Soviet Union in 1959; he attempted
to expatriate himself and acquire Soviet citizenship; and he
resided in the Soviet Union until June of 1962. After his return to the
United States he sought to maintain contacts with the Communist
Party, Socialist Workers Party, and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee;
he associated with various Russian-speaking citizens in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area—some of whom had resided in Russia; he traveled
to Mexico City where he visited both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies
7 weeks before the assassination; and he corresponded with the Soviet
Embassy in Washington, D.C. In view of these activities, the Commission
has instituted a thorough investigation to determine whether
the assassination was in some manner directed or encouraged through
contacts made abroad or through Oswald’s politically oriented activities
in this country. The Commission has also considered whether
any connections existed between Oswald and certain right-wing activity
in Dallas which, shortly before the assassination, led to the publication
of hostile criticism of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>The final section of this chapter considers the possibility that Jack
Ruby was part of a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy.
The Commission explored Ruby’s background and his activities in the
months prior to the assassination, and especially his activities in the
2 days after the assassination, in an effort to determine whether there
was any indication that Ruby was implicated in that event. The Commission
also sought to ascertain the truth or falsity of assertions that
Oswald and Ruby were known to one another prior to the assassination.</p>

<p>In considering the question of foreign involvement, the Commission
has received valuable assistance from the Department of State,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
and other Federal agencies with special competence in the field of foreign
investigation. Some of the information furnished by these agencies
is of a highly confidential nature. Nevertheless, because the
disclosure of all facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy
is of great public importance, the Commission has included in
this report all information furnished by these agencies which the
Commission relied upon in coming to its conclusions, or which tended
to contradict those conclusions. Confidential sources of information,
as contrasted with the information itself, have, in a relatively few
instances, been withheld.</p>

<h3 id="hdr120">CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE ASSASSINATION</h3>

<p>Earlier chapters have set forth the evidence upon which the Commission
concluded that President Kennedy was fired upon from a
single window in the southeast corner of the sixth floor of the Texas
School Book Depository, and that Lee Harvey Oswald was the person
who fired the shots from this point. As reflected in those chapters,
a certain sequence of events necessarily took place in order for the
assassination to have occurred as it did. The motorcade traveled past
the Texas School Book Depository; Oswald had access to the sixth
floor of the building; Oswald brought the rifle into the building;
the cartons were arranged at the sixth-floor window; and Oswald escaped
from the building before the police had sealed off the exits. Accordingly,
the Commission has investigated these circumstances to
determine whether Oswald received help from any other person in
planning or performing the shooting.</p>

<h4 id="hdr121">Selection of Motorcade Route</h4>

<p>The factors involved in the choice of the motorcade route by the
Secret Service have been discussed in chapter II of this report.<a id="FNanchor_C6-2" href="#Footnote_C6-2" class="fnanchor">C6-2</a> It
was there indicated that after passing through a portion of suburban
Dallas, the motorcade was to travel west on Main Street, and then to
the Trade Mart by way of the Stemmons Freeway, the most direct
route from that point. This route would take the motorcade along the
traditional parade route through downtown Dallas; it allowed the
maximum number of persons to observe the President; and it enabled
the motorcade to cover the distance from Love Field to the Trade
Mart in the 45 minutes allocated by members of the White House staff
planning the President’s schedule in Dallas. No member of the Secret
Service, the Dallas Police Department, or the local host committee
who was consulted felt that any other route would be preferable.</p>

<p>To reach Stemmons Freeway from Main Street, it was determined
that the motorcade would turn right from Main Street onto Houston
Street for one block and then left onto Elm Street, proceeding through
the Triple Underpass to the Stemmons Freeway access road. This
route took the motorcade past the Texas School Book Depository<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
Building on the northwest corner of Elm and Houston Streets. Because
of the sharp turn at this corner, the motorcade also reduced its
speed. The motorcade would have passed approximately 90 yards
further from the Depository Building and made no turn near the building
if it had attempted to reach the Stemmons Freeway directly from
Main Street. The road plan in Dealey Plaza, however, is designed
to prevent such a turn. In order to keep motorists from reaching
the freeway from Main Street, a concrete barrier has been erected
between Main and Elm Streets extending beyond the freeway entrance.
(See Commission Exhibits Nos. 2114-2116, <a href="#Page_35">pp. 35-37</a>.) Hence, it
would have been necessary for the motorcade either to have driven
over this barrier or to have made a sharp <b class="sans">S</b>-turn in order to have entered
the freeway from Main Street. Selection of the motorcade route
was thus entirely appropriate and based on such legitimate considerations
as the origin and destination of the motorcade, the desired opportunity
for the President to greet large numbers of people, and normal
patterns of traffic.</p>

<h4 id="hdr122">Oswald’s Presence in the Depository Building</h4>

<p>Oswald’s presence as an employee in the Texas School Book Depository
Building was the result of a series of happenings unrelated to
the President’s trip to Dallas. He obtained the Depository job after
almost 2 weeks of job hunting which began immediately upon his
arrival in Dallas from Mexico on October 3, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-3" href="#Footnote_C6-3" class="fnanchor">C6-3</a> At that time he
was in poor financial circumstances, having arrived from Mexico City
with approximately $133 or less,<a id="FNanchor_C6-4" href="#Footnote_C6-4" class="fnanchor">C6-4</a> and with his unemployment compensation
benefits due to expire on October 8.<a id="FNanchor_C6-5" href="#Footnote_C6-5" class="fnanchor">C6-5</a> Oswald and his wife
were expecting the birth of their second child, who was in fact born on
October 20.<a id="FNanchor_C6-6" href="#Footnote_C6-6" class="fnanchor">C6-6</a> In attempting to procure work, Oswald utilized normal
channels, including the Texas Employment Commission.<a id="FNanchor_C6-7" href="#Footnote_C6-7" class="fnanchor">C6-7</a></p>

<p>On October 4, 1963, Oswald applied for a position with Padgett
Printing Corp., which was located at 1313 Industrial Boulevard, several
blocks from President Kennedy’s parade route.<a id="FNanchor_C6-8" href="#Footnote_C6-8" class="fnanchor">C6-8</a> Oswald favorably
impressed the plant superintendent who checked his prior job
references, one of which was Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall, the firm where
Oswald had done photography work from October 1962 to April 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-9" href="#Footnote_C6-9" class="fnanchor">C6-9</a>
The following report was written by Padgett’s plant superintendent
on the reverse side of Oswald’s job application: “Bob Stovall does not
recommend this man. He was released because of his record as a
troublemaker.—Has Communistic tendencies.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-10" href="#Footnote_C6-10" class="fnanchor">C6-10</a> Oswald received
word that Padgett Printing had hired someone else.<a id="FNanchor_C6-11" href="#Footnote_C6-11" class="fnanchor">C6-11</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s employment with the Texas School Book Depository came
about through a chance conversation on Monday, October 14, between
Ruth Paine, with whom his family was staying while Oswald was
living in a roominghouse in Dallas, and two of Mrs. Paine’s neighbors.<a id="FNanchor_C6-12" href="#Footnote_C6-12" class="fnanchor">C6-12</a>
During a morning conversation over coffee, at which Marina
Oswald was present, Oswald’s search for employment was mentioned.
The neighbors suggested several places where Oswald might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
apply for work. One of the neighbors present, Linnie Mae Randle,
said that her brother had recently been hired as a schoolbook order
filler at the Texas School Book Depository and she thought the Depository
might need additional help. She testified, “and of course
you know just being neighborly and everything, we felt sorry for
Marina because her baby was due right away as we understood it, and
he didn’t have any work * * *.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-13" href="#Footnote_C6-13" class="fnanchor">C6-13</a></p>

<p>When Marina Oswald and Mrs. Paine returned home, Mrs. Paine
promptly telephoned the Texas School Book Depository and spoke
to Superintendent Roy Truly, whom she did not know.<a id="FNanchor_C6-14" href="#Footnote_C6-14" class="fnanchor">C6-14</a> Truly agreed
to interview Oswald, who at the time was in Dallas seeking employment.
When Oswald called that evening, Mrs. Paine told him of her
conversation with Truly.<a id="FNanchor_C6-15" href="#Footnote_C6-15" class="fnanchor">C6-15</a> The next morning Oswald went to the
Texas School Book Depository where he was interviewed and hired
for the position of order filler.<a id="FNanchor_C6-16" href="#Footnote_C6-16" class="fnanchor">C6-16</a></p>

<p>On the same date, the Texas Employment Commission attempted
to refer Oswald to an airline company which was looking for baggage
and cargo handlers at a salary which was $100 per month higher than
that offered by the Depository Co.<a id="FNanchor_C6-17" href="#Footnote_C6-17" class="fnanchor">C6-17</a> The Employment Commission
tried to advise Oswald of this job at 10:30 a.m. on October 16, 1963.
Since the records of the Commission indicate that Oswald was then
working,<a id="FNanchor_C6-18" href="#Footnote_C6-18" class="fnanchor">C6-18</a> it seems clear that Oswald was hired by the Depository Co.
before the higher paying job was available. It is unlikely that he ever
learned of this second opportunity.</p>

<p>Although publicity concerning the President’s trip to Dallas appeared
in Dallas newspapers as early as September 13, 1963, the planning
of the motorcade route was not started until after November 4,
when the Secret Service was first notified of the trip.<a id="FNanchor_C6-19" href="#Footnote_C6-19" class="fnanchor">C6-19</a> A final decision
as to the route could not have been reached until November 14, when the
Trade Mart was selected as the luncheon site.<a id="FNanchor_C6-20" href="#Footnote_C6-20" class="fnanchor">C6-20</a> Although news reports
on November 15 and November 16 might have led a person to believe
that the motorcade would pass the Depository Building, the route was
not finally selected until November 18; it was announced in the press
on November 19, only 3 days before the President’s arrival.<a id="FNanchor_C6-21" href="#Footnote_C6-21" class="fnanchor">C6-21</a> Based
on the circumstances of Oswald’s employment and the planning of the
motorcade route, the Commission has concluded that Oswald’s
employment in the Depository was wholly unrelated to the President’s
trip to Dallas.</p>

<h4 id="hdr123">Bringing Rifle Into Building</h4>

<p>On the basis of the evidence developed in chapter IV the Commission
concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald carried the rifle used in the
assassination into the Depository Building on Friday, November 22,
1963, in the handmade brown paper bag found near the window from
which the shots were fired.<a id="FNanchor_C6-22" href="#Footnote_C6-22" class="fnanchor">C6-22</a> The arrangement by which Buell Wesley
Frazier drove Oswald between Irving and Dallas was an innocent
one, having commenced when Oswald first started working at
the Depository.<a id="FNanchor_C6-23" href="#Footnote_C6-23" class="fnanchor">C6-23</a> As noted above, it was Frazier’s sister, Linnie May
Randle, who had suggested to Ruth Paine that Oswald might be able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
to find employment at the Depository. When Oswald started working
there, Frazier, who lived only a half block away from the Paines,
offered to drive Oswald to and from Irving whenever he was going
to stay at the Paines’ home.<a id="FNanchor_C6-24" href="#Footnote_C6-24" class="fnanchor">C6-24</a> Although Oswald’s request for a ride to
Irving on Thursday, November 21, was a departure from the normal
weekend pattern, Oswald gave the explanation that he needed to
obtain curtain rods for an “apartment” in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-25" href="#Footnote_C6-25" class="fnanchor">C6-25</a> This served also
to explain the long package which he took with him from Irving to
the Depository Building the next morning.<a id="FNanchor_C6-26" href="#Footnote_C6-26" class="fnanchor">C6-26</a> Further, there is no
evidence that Ruth Paine or Marina Oswald had reason to believe that
Oswald’s return was in any way related to an attempt to shoot the
President the next day. Although his visit was a surprise, since he
arrived on Thursday instead of Friday for his usual weekend visit,
both women testified that they thought he had come to patch up a
quarrel which he had with his wife a few days earlier when she learned
that he was living in Dallas under an assumed name.<a id="FNanchor_C6-27" href="#Footnote_C6-27" class="fnanchor">C6-27</a></p>

<p>It has also been shown that Oswald had the opportunity to work in
the Paines’ garage on Thursday evening and prepare the rifle by disassembling
it, if it were not already disassembled, and packing it in
the brown bag.<a id="FNanchor_C6-28" href="#Footnote_C6-28" class="fnanchor">C6-28</a> It has been demonstrated that the paper and tape
from which the bag was made came from the shipping room of the
Texas School Book Depository and that Oswald had access to this material.<a id="FNanchor_C6-29" href="#Footnote_C6-29" class="fnanchor">C6-29</a>
Neither Ruth Paine nor Marina Oswald saw the paper bag or
the paper and tape out of which the bag was constructed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-30" href="#Footnote_C6-30" class="fnanchor">C6-30</a> If
Oswald actually prepared the bag in the Depository out of materials
available to him there, he could have concealed it in the jacket or shirt
which he was wearing.<a id="FNanchor_C6-31" href="#Footnote_C6-31" class="fnanchor">C6-31</a> The Commission has found no evidence which
suggests that Oswald required or in fact received any assistance in
bringing the rifle into the building other than the innocent assistance
provided by Frazier in the form of the ride to work.</p>

<h4 id="hdr124">Accomplices at the Scene of the Assassination</h4>

<p>The arrangement of boxes at the window from which the shots
were fired was studied to determine whether Oswald required any
assistance in moving the cartons to the window. Cartons had been
stacked on the floor, a few feet behind the window, thus shielding
Oswald from the view of anyone on the sixth floor who did not attempt
to go behind them.<a id="FNanchor_C6-32" href="#Footnote_C6-32" class="fnanchor">C6-32</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 723,
<a href="#Page_80">p. 80</a>.) Most of those cartons had been moved there by other employees
to clear an area for laying a new flooring on the west end
of the sixth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C6-33" href="#Footnote_C6-33" class="fnanchor">C6-33</a> Superintendent Roy Truly testified that the floor-laying
crew moved a long row of books parallel to the windows on
the south side and had “quite a lot of cartons” in the southeast corner
of the building.<a id="FNanchor_C6-34" href="#Footnote_C6-34" class="fnanchor">C6-34</a> He said that there was not any particular pattern
that the men used in putting them there. “They were just piled up there
more or less at that time.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-35" href="#Footnote_C6-35" class="fnanchor">C6-35</a> According to Truly, “several cartons”
which had been in the extreme southeast corner had been placed on top
of the ones that had been piled in front of the southeast corner window.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-36" href="#Footnote_C6-36" class="fnanchor">C6-36</a></p>

<p>The arrangement of the three boxes in the window and the one
on which the assassin may have sat has been described previously.<a id="FNanchor_C6-37" href="#Footnote_C6-37" class="fnanchor">C6-37</a>
Two of these four boxes, weighing approximately 55 pounds each, had
been moved by the floor-laying crew from the west side of the floor to
the area near the southwest corner.<a id="FNanchor_C6-38" href="#Footnote_C6-38" class="fnanchor">C6-38</a> The carton on which the assassin
may have sat might not even have been moved by the assassin at all.
A photograph of the scene depicts this carton on the floor alongside
other similar cartons. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1301, <a href="#Page_138">p. 138</a>.)
Oswald’s right palmprint on this carton may have been placed there
as he was sitting on the carton rather than while carrying it. In any
event both of these 55-pound cartons could have been carried by one
man. The remaining two cartons contained light block-like reading
aids called “Rolling Readers” weighing only about 8 pounds each.<a id="FNanchor_C6-39" href="#Footnote_C6-39" class="fnanchor">C6-39</a>
Although they had been moved approximately 40 feet<a id="FNanchor_C6-40" href="#Footnote_C6-40" class="fnanchor">C6-40</a> from their
normal locations at the southeast corner window, it would appear that
one man could have done this in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>In considering the possibility of accomplices at the window, the
Commission evaluated the significance of the presence of fingerprints
other than Oswald’s on the four cartons found in and near the window.
Three of Oswald’s prints were developed on two of the cartons.<a id="FNanchor_C6-41" href="#Footnote_C6-41" class="fnanchor">C6-41</a>
In addition a total of 25 identifiable prints were found on
the 4 cartons.<a id="FNanchor_C6-42" href="#Footnote_C6-42" class="fnanchor">C6-42</a> Moreover, prints were developed which were considered
as not identifiable, i.e., the quality of the print was too fragmentary
to be of value for identification purposes.<a id="FNanchor_C6-43" href="#Footnote_C6-43" class="fnanchor">C6-43</a></p>

<p>As has been explained in chapter IV, the Commission determined
that none of the warehouse employees who might have customarily
handled these cartons left prints which could be identified.<a id="FNanchor_C6-44" href="#Footnote_C6-44" class="fnanchor">C6-44</a> This
was considered of some probative value in determining whether Oswald
moved the cartons to the window. All but 1 of the 25 definitely
identifiable prints were the prints of 2 persons—an FBI employee and
a member of the Dallas Police Department who had handled the
cartons during the course of the investigation.<a id="FNanchor_C6-45" href="#Footnote_C6-45" class="fnanchor">C6-45</a> One identifiable
palmprint was not identified.<a id="FNanchor_C6-46" href="#Footnote_C6-46" class="fnanchor">C6-46</a></p>

<p>The presence on these cartons of unidentified prints, whether or not
identifiable, does not appear to be unusual since these cartons contained
commercial products which had been handled by many people
throughout the normal course of manufacturing, warehousing, and
shipping. Unlike other items of evidence such as, for example, a ransom
note in a kidnaping, these cartons could contain the prints of
many people having nothing to do with the assassination. Moreover,
the FBI does not maintain a filing system for palmprints because,
according to the supervisor of the Bureau’s latent fingerprint section,
Sebastian F. Latona, the problems of classification make such a system
impracticable.<a id="FNanchor_C6-47" href="#Footnote_C6-47" class="fnanchor">C6-47</a> Finally, in considering the significance of the unidentified
prints, the Commission gave weight to the opinion of Latona to
the effect that people could handle these cartons without leaving prints
which were capable of being developed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-48" href="#Footnote_C6-48" class="fnanchor">C6-48</a></p>

<p>Though the fingerprints other than Oswald’s on the boxes thus
provide no indication of the presence of an accomplice at the window,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
two Depository employees are known to have been present
briefly on the sixth floor during the period between 11:45 a.m., when
the floor-laying crew stopped for lunch, and the moment of the assassination.
One of these was Charles Givens, a member of the floor-laying
crew, who went down on the elevator with the others and then,
returned to the sixth floor to get his jacket and cigarettes.<a id="FNanchor_C6-49" href="#Footnote_C6-49" class="fnanchor">C6-49</a> He saw
Oswald walking away from the southeast corner, but saw no one else
on the sixth floor at that time. He then took one of the elevators back
to the first floor at approximately 11:55 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-50" href="#Footnote_C6-50" class="fnanchor">C6-50</a></p>

<p>Bonnie Ray Williams, who was also working with the floor-laying
crew, returned to the sixth floor at about noon to eat his lunch and
watch the motorcade.<a id="FNanchor_C6-51" href="#Footnote_C6-51" class="fnanchor">C6-51</a> He looked out on Elm Street from a position
in the area of the third or fourth set of windows from the east wall.<a id="FNanchor_C6-52" href="#Footnote_C6-52" class="fnanchor">C6-52</a>
At this point he was approximately 20-30 feet away from the southeast
corner window. He remained for about “5, 10, maybe 12 minutes”
eating his lunch which consisted of chicken and a bottle of soda pop.<a id="FNanchor_C6-53" href="#Footnote_C6-53" class="fnanchor">C6-53</a>
Williams saw no one on the sixth floor during this period, although
the stacks of books prevented his seeing the east side of the building.<a id="FNanchor_C6-54" href="#Footnote_C6-54" class="fnanchor">C6-54</a>
After finishing his lunch Williams took the elevator down because
no one had joined him on the sixth floor to watch the motorcade.<a id="FNanchor_C6-55" href="#Footnote_C6-55" class="fnanchor">C6-55</a> He
stopped at the fifth floor where he joined Harold Norman and James
Jarman, Jr., who watched the motorcade with him from a position
on the fifth floor directly below the point from which the shots were
fired. Williams left the remains of his lunch, including chicken bones
and a bottle of soda, near the window where he was eating.<a id="FNanchor_C6-56" href="#Footnote_C6-56" class="fnanchor">C6-56</a></p>

<p>Several witnesses outside the building claim to have seen a person
in the southeast corner window of the sixth floor. As has already been
indicated, some were able to offer better descriptions than others and
one, Howard L. Brennan, made a positive identification of Oswald as
being the person at the window.<a id="FNanchor_C6-57" href="#Footnote_C6-57" class="fnanchor">C6-57</a> Although there are differences
among these witnesses with regard to their ability to describe the person
they saw, none of these witnesses testified to seeing more than one
person in the window.<a id="FNanchor_C6-58" href="#Footnote_C6-58" class="fnanchor">C6-58</a></p>

<p>One witness, however, offered testimony which, if accurate, would
create the possibility of an accomplice at the window at the time of
the assassination. The witness was 18-year-old Arnold Rowland, who
testified in great detail concerning his activities and observations on
November 22, 1963. He and his wife were awaiting the motorcade,
standing on the east side of Houston Street between Maine and Elm,<a id="FNanchor_C6-59" href="#Footnote_C6-59" class="fnanchor">C6-59</a>
when he looked toward the Depository Building and noticed a man
holding a rifle standing back from the southwest corner window on
the sixth floor. The man was rather slender in proportion to his
size and of light complexion with dark hair.<a id="FNanchor_C6-60" href="#Footnote_C6-60" class="fnanchor">C6-60</a> Rowland said that his
wife was looking elsewhere at the time and when they looked back
to the window the man “was gone from our vision.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-61" href="#Footnote_C6-61" class="fnanchor">C6-61</a> They thought
the man was most likely someone protecting the President. After
the assassination Rowland signed an affidavit in which he told of seeing
this man, although Rowland was unable to identify him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-62" href="#Footnote_C6-62" class="fnanchor">C6-62</a></p>

<p>When Rowland testified before the Commission on March 10, 1964,
he claimed for the first time to have seen another person on the sixth
floor. Rowland said that before he had noticed the man with the
rifle on the southwest corner of the sixth floor he had seen an elderly
Negro man “hanging out that window” on the southeast corner of the
sixth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C6-63" href="#Footnote_C6-63" class="fnanchor">C6-63</a> Rowland described the Negro man as “very thin, an
elderly gentleman, bald or practically bald, very thin hair if he wasn’t
bald,” between 50 and 60 years of age, 5 feet 8 inches to 5 feet 10 inches
tall, with fairly dark complexion.<a id="FNanchor_C6-64" href="#Footnote_C6-64" class="fnanchor">C6-64</a> Rowland claimed that he looked
back two or three times and noticed that the man remained until 5 or 6
minutes prior to the time the motorcade came. Rowland did not see
him thereafter. He made no mention of the Negro man in his affidavit.<a id="FNanchor_C6-65" href="#Footnote_C6-65" class="fnanchor">C6-65</a>
And, while he said he told FBI agents about the man in the
southeast corner window when interviewed on the Saturday and Sunday
following the assassination,<a id="FNanchor_C6-66" href="#Footnote_C6-66" class="fnanchor">C6-66</a> no such statement appears in any
FBI report.<a id="FNanchor_C6-67" href="#Footnote_C6-67" class="fnanchor">C6-67</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Rowland testified that her husband never told her about seeing
any other man on the sixth floor except the man with the rifle
in the southwest corner that he first saw. She also was present during
Rowland’s interview with representatives of the FBI<a id="FNanchor_C6-68" href="#Footnote_C6-68" class="fnanchor">C6-68</a> and said
she did not hear him make such a statement,<a id="FNanchor_C6-69" href="#Footnote_C6-69" class="fnanchor">C6-69</a> although she also said
that she did not hear everything that was discussed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-70" href="#Footnote_C6-70" class="fnanchor">C6-70</a> Mrs. Rowland
testified that after her husband first talked about seeing a man with
the rifle, she looked back more than once at the Depository Building
and saw no person looking out of any window on the sixth floor.<a id="FNanchor_C6-71" href="#Footnote_C6-71" class="fnanchor">C6-71</a>
She also said that “At times my husband is prone to exaggerate.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-72" href="#Footnote_C6-72" class="fnanchor">C6-72</a>
Because of inconsistencies in Rowland’s testimony and the importance
of his testimony to the question of a possible accomplice, the Commission
requested the FBI to conduct an inquiry into the truth of
a broad range of statements made by Rowland to the Commission.
The investigation showed that numerous statements by Rowland concerning
matters about which he would not normally be expected to
be mistaken—such as subjects he studied in school, grades he received,
whether or not he had graduated from high school, and whether
or not he had been admitted to college—were false.<a id="FNanchor_C6-73" href="#Footnote_C6-73" class="fnanchor">C6-73</a></p>

<p>The only possible corroboration for Rowland’s story is found in
the testimony of Roger D. Craig, a deputy sheriff of Dallas County,
whose testimony on other aspects of the case has been discussed in
chapter IV. Craig claimed that about 10 minutes after the assassination
he talked to a young couple, Mr. and Mrs. Rowland,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * and the boy said he saw two men on the sixth floor of the
Book Depository Building over there; one of them had a rifle with
a telescopic sight on it—but he thought they were Secret Service
agents or guards and didn’t report it. This was about—oh, he
said, 15 minutes before the motorcade ever arrived.<a id="FNanchor_C6-74" href="#Footnote_C6-74" class="fnanchor">C6-74</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">According to Craig, Rowland said that he looked back a few minutes
later and “the other man was gone, and there was just one man—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
man with the rifle.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-75" href="#Footnote_C6-75" class="fnanchor">C6-75</a> Craig further testified that Rowland told him
that when he first saw the two men, they were walking back and
forth in front of the window for several minutes. They were both
white men and one of them had a rifle with a scope on it.<a id="FNanchor_C6-76" href="#Footnote_C6-76" class="fnanchor">C6-76</a> This report
by Craig is contradicted by the testimony of both the Rowlands,
and by every recorded interview with them conducted by law enforcement
agencies after the assassination.</p>

<p>As part of its investigation of Rowland’s allegation and of the
general question of accomplices at the scene of the assassination, the
Commission undertook an investigation of every person employed
in the Texas School Book Depository Building. Two employees
might possibly fit the general description of an elderly Negro man,
bald or balding. These two men were on the first floor of the building
during the period before and during the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-77" href="#Footnote_C6-77" class="fnanchor">C6-77</a> Moreover,
all of the employees were asked whether they saw any strangers
in the building on the morning of November 22.<a id="FNanchor_C6-78" href="#Footnote_C6-78" class="fnanchor">C6-78</a> Only one employee
saw a stranger whom he described as a feeble individual who had
to be helped up the front steps of the building. He went to a public
restroom and left the building 5 minutes later, about 40 minutes
before the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-79" href="#Footnote_C6-79" class="fnanchor">C6-79</a></p>

<p>Rowland’s failure to report his story despite several interviews until
his appearance before the Commission, the lack of probative corroboration,
and the serious doubts about his credibility, have led the
Commission to reject the testimony that Rowland saw an elderly
balding Negro man in the southeast corner window of the sixth floor
of the Depository Building several minutes before the assassination.</p>

<h4 id="hdr125">Oswald’s Escape</h4>

<p>The Commission has analyzed Oswald’s movements between the time
of the assassination and the shooting of Patrolman Tippit to determine
whether there is any evidence that Oswald had assistance in his flight
from the building. Oswald’s activities during this period have been
traced through the testimony of seven witnesses and discussed in
detail in chapter IV.<a id="FNanchor_C6-80" href="#Footnote_C6-80" class="fnanchor">C6-80</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, <a href="#Page_158">p.
158</a> and Commission Exhibit No. 1118, <a href="#Page_150">p. 150</a>.) Patrolman M. L.
Baker and Depository superintendent Roy Truly saw him within 2
minutes of the assassination on the second floor of the building.
Mrs. R. A. Reid saw him less than 1 minute later walking through
the second-floor offices toward the front of the building. A busdriver,
Cecil J. McWatters, and Oswald’s former landlady, Mrs. Mary Bledsoe,
saw him board a bus at approximately 12:40 p.m., and get off
about 4 minutes later. A cabdriver, William W. Whaley, drove
Oswald from a cabstand located a few blocks from where Oswald
left the bus to a point in Oak Cliff about four blocks from his roominghouse;
and Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper at Oswald’s roominghouse,
saw him enter the roominghouse at about 1 p.m. and leave a few
minutes later. When seen by these seven witnesses Oswald was always
alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
Particular attention has been directed to Oswald’s departure from
the Depository Building in order to determine whether he could have
left the building within approximately 3 minutes of the assassination
without assistance. As discussed more fully in chapter IV, the building
was probably first sealed off no earlier than 12:37 by Inspector
Herbert Sawyer.<a id="FNanchor_C6-81" href="#Footnote_C6-81" class="fnanchor">C6-81</a> The shortest estimate of the time taken to seal off
the building comes from Police Officer W. E. Barnett, one of the officers
assigned to the corner of Elm and Houston Streets for the Presidential
motorcade, who estimated that approximately 3 minutes elapsed between
the time he heard the last of the shots and the time he started
guarding the front door.<a id="FNanchor_C6-82" href="#Footnote_C6-82" class="fnanchor">C6-82</a> According to Barnett, “there were people
going in and out” during this period.<a id="FNanchor_C6-83" href="#Footnote_C6-83" class="fnanchor">C6-83</a> The evidence discussed in
chapter IV shows that 3 minutes would have been sufficient time for
Oswald to have descended from the sixth floor and left the building
without assistance.<a id="FNanchor_C6-84" href="#Footnote_C6-84" class="fnanchor">C6-84</a></p>

<p>One witness, James R. Worrell, Jr., claims to have seen a man running
from the rear of the building shortly after the assassination, but
in testimony before the Commission he stated that he could not see
his face.<a id="FNanchor_C6-85" href="#Footnote_C6-85" class="fnanchor">C6-85</a> Two other witnesses who watched the rear of the building
during the first 5 minutes after the shooting saw no one leave.<a id="FNanchor_C6-86" href="#Footnote_C6-86" class="fnanchor">C6-86</a>
The claim of Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig that he saw Oswald leave the
Depository Building approximately 15 minutes after the assassination
has been discussed in chapter IV.<a id="FNanchor_C6-87" href="#Footnote_C6-87" class="fnanchor">C6-87</a> Although Craig may have seen
someone enter a station wagon 15 minutes after the assassination, the
person he saw was not Lee Harvey Oswald, who was far removed from
the building at that time.</p>

<p>The possibility that accomplices aided Oswald in connection with
his escape was suggested by the testimony of Earlene Roberts, the
housekeeper at the 1026 North Beckley roominghouse.<a id="FNanchor_C6-88" href="#Footnote_C6-88" class="fnanchor">C6-88</a> She testified
that at about 1 p.m. on November 22, after Oswald had returned to
the roominghouse, a Dallas police car drove slowly by the front of
the 1026 North Beckley premises and stopped momentarily; she said
she heard its horn several times.<a id="FNanchor_C6-89" href="#Footnote_C6-89" class="fnanchor">C6-89</a> Mrs. Roberts stated that the occupants
of the car were not known to her even though she had worked
for some policemen who would occasionally come by.<a id="FNanchor_C6-90" href="#Footnote_C6-90" class="fnanchor">C6-90</a> She
said the policeman she knew drove car No. 170 and that this was not
the number on the police car that honked on November 22. She
testified that she first thought the car she saw was No. 106 and
then said that it was No. 107.<a id="FNanchor_C6-91" href="#Footnote_C6-91" class="fnanchor">C6-91</a> In an FBI interview she had stated
that she looked out the front window and saw police car No.
207.<a id="FNanchor_C6-92" href="#Footnote_C6-92" class="fnanchor">C6-92</a> Investigation has not produced any evidence that there was a
police vehicle in the area of 1026 North Beckley at about 1 p.m. on November
22.<a id="FNanchor_C6-93" href="#Footnote_C6-93" class="fnanchor">C6-93</a> Squad car 207 was at the Texas School Book Depository
Building, as was car 106. Squad cars 170 and 107 were sold in April
1963 and their numbers were not reassigned until February 1964.<a id="FNanchor_C6-94" href="#Footnote_C6-94" class="fnanchor">C6-94</a></p>

<p>Whatever may be the accuracy of Mrs. Roberts’ recollection concerning
the police car, it is apparent from Mrs. Roberts’ further testimony
that she did not see Oswald enter a car when he hurriedly left the
house. She has stated that when she last saw Oswald, shortly after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
1 p.m., he was standing at a bus stop in front of the house.<a id="FNanchor_C6-95" href="#Footnote_C6-95" class="fnanchor">C6-95</a> Oswald
was next seen less than 1 mile away, at the point where he shot Patrolman
Tippit. Oswald could have easily reached this point on foot by
about 1:16 p.m., when Tippit was shot. Finally, investigation has produced
no evidence that Oswald had prearranged plans for a means to
leave Dallas after the assassination or that any other person was to
have provided him assistance in hiding or in departing the city.</p>

<h3 id="hdr126">BACKGROUND OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD</h3>

<p>Finding no evidence in the circumstances immediately surrounding
the assassination that any person other than Lee Harvey Oswald
was involved in the killing of the President, the Commission directed
an intensive investigation into his life for the purpose, among others,
of detecting any possible traces that at some point he became involved
in a conspiracy culminating in the deed of November 22, 1963. As a
product of this investigation, the Commission has compiled a detailed
chronological biography of Oswald which is set forth as appendix
XIII. Study of the period from Oswald’s birth in 1939 to his military
service from 1956 to 1959 has revealed no evidence that he was
associated with any type of sinister or subversive organization during
that period. Though his personality and political views took
shape during these early years, the events of that period are significant
primarily to an understanding of the personality of Lee Harvey
Oswald and are discussed in that connection in chapter VII.
Beginning with his preparation for defection to the Soviet Union in
1959, however, Oswald engaged in several activities which required
close scrutiny by the Commission. In an appraisal of Oswald’s actions
since 1959 for the purpose of determining whether he was part of
a conspiracy, several aspects of his background and character must
be borne in mind. He was young, inexperienced, and had only a
limited education. As will be more fully discussed in chapter VII,
he was unable to establish relationships with others and had a resentment
for authority and any discipline flowing from it. While he
demonstrated the ability to act secretively and alone, without regard
to the consequences to himself, as in his defection to the Soviet Union,
he does not appear to have been the kind of person whom one would
normally expect to be selected as a conspirator.</p>

<h4 id="hdr127">Residence in the Soviet Union</h4>

<p>Lee Harvey Oswald was openly committed to Marxist ideology, he
defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, and resided there until June
of 1962, eventually returning to the United States with a Russian
wife. In order to evaluate rumors and speculations<a id="FNanchor_C6-96" href="#Footnote_C6-96" class="fnanchor">C6-96</a> that Oswald may
have been an agent of the Soviet Union, the Commission investigated
the facts surrounding Oswald’s stay in Russia. The Commission
was thus fulfilling its obligation to probe all facts of possible relevance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
to the assassination, and does not suggest by this investigation
that the rulers of the Soviet Union believed that their political interests
would be advanced by the assassination of President Kennedy.
On this question, the Secretary of State testified before the Commission
on June 10, 1964 as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have seen no evidence that would indicate to me that the
Soviet Union considered that it had an interest in the removal
of President Kennedy or that it was in any way involved in
the removal of President Kennedy.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I have not seen or heard of any scrap of evidence indicating
that the Soviet Union had any desire to eliminate President
Kennedy nor in any way participated in any such event.</p>

<p>Now, standing back and trying to look at that question objectively
despite the ideological differences between our two
great systems, I can’t see how it could be to the interest of the
Soviet Union to make any such effort.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I do think that the Soviet Union, again objectively considered,
has an interest in the correctness of state relations. This would
be particularly true among the great powers, with which the
major interests of the Soviet Union are directly engaged.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I think that although there are grave differences between
the Communist world and the free world, between the Soviet
Union and other major powers, that even from their point of
view there needs to be some shape and form to international
relations, that it is not in their interest to have this world structure
dissolve into complete anarchy, that great states and particularly
nuclear powers have to be in a position to deal with
each other, to transact business with each other, to try to meet
problems with each other, and that requires the maintenance of
correct relations and access to the leadership on all sides.</p>

<p>I think also that although there had been grave differences between
Chairman Khrushchev and President Kennedy, I think
there were evidences of a certain mutual respect that had developed
over some of the experiences, both good and bad, through
which these two men had lived.</p>

<p>I think both of them were aware of the fact that any Chairman
of the Soviet Union, and any President of the United States,
necessarily bear somewhat special responsibility for the general
peace of the world. Indeed without exaggeration, one could almost
say the existence of the northern hemisphere in this nuclear
age.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
So that it would be an act of rashness and madness for Soviet
leaders to undertake such an action as an active policy. Because
everything would have been put in jeopardy or at stake in connection
with such an act.</p>

<p>It has not been our impression that madness has characterized
the actions of the Soviet leadership in recent years.<a id="FNanchor_C6-97" href="#Footnote_C6-97" class="fnanchor">C6-97</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Commission accepts Secretary Rusk’s estimate as reasonable
and objective, but recognizes that a precise assessment of Soviet intentions
or interests is most difficult. The Commission has thus examined
all the known facts regarding Oswald’s defection, residence in the
Soviet Union, and return to the United States. At each step the
Commission sought to determine whether there was any evidence
which supported a conclusion that Soviet authorities may have directly
or indirectly influenced Oswald’s actions in assassinating the
President.</p>

<p><i>Oswald’s entry into the Soviet Union.</i>—Although the evidence
is inconclusive as to the factors which motivated Oswald to go to the
Soviet Union, there is no indication that he was prompted to do so
by agents of that country. He may have begun to study the
Russian language when he was stationed in Japan, which was intermittently
from August 1957 to November 1958.<a id="FNanchor_C6-98" href="#Footnote_C6-98" class="fnanchor">C6-98</a> After he arrived
in Moscow in October 1959 he told several persons that he had been
planning his defection for 2 years, which suggests that the decision
was made while he was in the Far East.<a id="FNanchor_C6-99" href="#Footnote_C6-99" class="fnanchor">C6-99</a> George De Mohrenschildt,
who met Oswald after his return from the Soviet Union, testified that
Oswald once told him much the same thing: “I met some Communists
in Japan and they got me excited and interested, and that was one of
my inducements in going to Soviet Russia, to see what goes on
there.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-100" href="#Footnote_C6-100" class="fnanchor">C6-100</a> This evidence, however, is somewhat at variance with
Oswald’s statements made to two American newspaper reporters in
Moscow shortly after his defection in 1959,<a id="FNanchor_C6-101" href="#Footnote_C6-101" class="fnanchor">C6-101</a> and to other people in
the United States after his return in 1962.<a id="FNanchor_C6-102" href="#Footnote_C6-102" class="fnanchor">C6-102</a> Though his remarks
were not inconsistent as to the time he decided to defect, to these
people he insisted that before going to the Soviet Union he had “never
met a Communist” and that the intent to defect derived entirely from
his own reading and thinking. He said much the same to his brother
in a letter he wrote to him from Russia explaining why he had defected.<a id="FNanchor_C6-103" href="#Footnote_C6-103" class="fnanchor">C6-103</a>
Which of Oswald’s statements was the more accurate remains
unknown.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that Oswald received outside assistance in
financing his trip to the Soviet Union. After he arrived in Moscow,
Oswald told a newspaper correspondent, Aline Mosby, that he had
saved $1,500 out of his Marine Corps salary to finance his defection,<a id="FNanchor_C6-104" href="#Footnote_C6-104" class="fnanchor">C6-104</a>
although the news story based upon Oswald’s interview with Aline
Mosby unaccountably listed the sum of $1,600 instead of $1,500.<a id="FNanchor_C6-105" href="#Footnote_C6-105" class="fnanchor">C6-105</a>
After this article had appeared, Marguerite Oswald also related the
$1,600 figure to an FBI agent.<a id="FNanchor_C6-106" href="#Footnote_C6-106" class="fnanchor">C6-106</a> Either amount could have been
accumulated out of Oswald’s earnings in the Marine Corps; during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
his 2 years and 10 months of service he received $3,452.20, after all
taxes, allotments and other deductions.<a id="FNanchor_C6-107" href="#Footnote_C6-107" class="fnanchor">C6-107</a> Moreover Oswald could
certainly have made the entire trip on less than $1,000. The ticket on
the ship he took from New Orleans to Le Havre, France, cost
$220.75;<a id="FNanchor_C6-108" href="#Footnote_C6-108" class="fnanchor">C6-108</a> it cost him about $20 to reach London from Le Havre;
his plane fare from London to Helsinki, where he received his visa,
cost him $111.90; he probably purchased Russian “tourist vouchers”
normally good for room and board for 10 days for $300; his train fare
from Helsinki to Moscow was about $44; in Moscow he paid only $1.50
to $3 a night for his room and very little for his meals after his tourist
vouchers ran out;<a id="FNanchor_C6-109" href="#Footnote_C6-109" class="fnanchor">C6-109</a> and apparently he did not pay his hotel bill at all
after November 30, 1959.<a id="FNanchor_C6-110" href="#Footnote_C6-110" class="fnanchor">C6-110</a> Oswald’s known living habits indicate that
he could be extraordinarily frugal when he had reason to be, and it
seems clear that he did have a strong desire to go to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>While in Atsugi, Japan, Oswald studied the Russian language,
perhaps with some help from an officer in his unit who was interested
in Russian and used to “talk about it” with Oswald occasionally.<a id="FNanchor_C6-111" href="#Footnote_C6-111" class="fnanchor">C6-111</a>
He studied by himself a great deal in late 1958 and early 1959 after
he was transferred from Japan to California.<a id="FNanchor_C6-112" href="#Footnote_C6-112" class="fnanchor">C6-112</a> He took an Army
aptitude test in Russian in February 1959 and rated “Poor.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-113" href="#Footnote_C6-113" class="fnanchor">C6-113</a> When
he reached the Soviet Union in October of the same year he could
barely speak the language.<a id="FNanchor_C6-114" href="#Footnote_C6-114" class="fnanchor">C6-114</a> During the period in Moscow while
he was awaiting decision on his application for citizenship, his diary
records that he practiced Russian 8 hours a day.<a id="FNanchor_C6-115" href="#Footnote_C6-115" class="fnanchor">C6-115</a> After he was
sent to Minsk in early January 1960 he took lessons from an interpreter
assigned to him for that purpose by the Soviet Government.<a id="FNanchor_C6-116" href="#Footnote_C6-116" class="fnanchor">C6-116</a>
Marina Oswald said that by the time she met him in March 1961 he
spoke the language well enough so that at first she thought he was
from one of the Baltic areas of her country, because of his accent.
She stated that his only defects were that his grammar was sometimes
incorrect and that his writing was never good.<a id="FNanchor_C6-117" href="#Footnote_C6-117" class="fnanchor">C6-117</a></p>

<p>Thus, the limited evidence provides no indication that Oswald was
recruited by Soviet agents in the Far East with a view toward defection
and eventual return to the United States. Moreover, on its face
such a possibility is most unlikely. If Soviet agents had communicated
with Oswald while he was in the Marine Corps, one of the least probable
instructions they would have given him would have been to
defect. If Oswald had remained a Marine radar specialist, he might
at some point have reached a position of value as a secret agent.
However, his defection and the disloyal statements he made publicly
in connection with it eliminated the possibility that he would ever
gain access to confidential information or programs of the United
States. The very fact that he defected, therefore, is itself persuasive
evidence that he was not recruited as an agent prior to his defection.</p>

<p>The Commission has investigated the circumstances under which
Oswald obtained a visa to enter the Soviet Union for possible evidence
that he received preferential treatment in being permitted to enter the
country. Oswald left New Orleans, La., for Europe on September 20,
1959,<a id="FNanchor_C6-118" href="#Footnote_C6-118" class="fnanchor">C6-118</a> having been released from active duty in the Marine Corps on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
September 11, 1959.<a id="FNanchor_C6-119" href="#Footnote_C6-119" class="fnanchor">C6-119</a> He went directly to Helsinki, Finland, by way
of Le Havre, France, and London, England, arriving at Helsinki on
Saturday, October 10, 1959.<a id="FNanchor_C6-120" href="#Footnote_C6-120" class="fnanchor">C6-120</a> Oswald probably arrived in Helsinki
too late in the evening to have applied for a visa at the Soviet Union
consulate that night.<a id="FNanchor_C6-121" href="#Footnote_C6-121" class="fnanchor">C6-121</a> In light of the rapidity with which he made
connections throughout his entire trip,<a id="FNanchor_C6-122" href="#Footnote_C6-122" class="fnanchor">C6-122</a> he probably applied for a
visa early on Monday, October 12. On October 14, he was issued
Soviet Tourist Visa No. 403339, good for one 6-day visit in the
U.S.S.R.<a id="FNanchor_C6-123" href="#Footnote_C6-123" class="fnanchor">C6-123</a> He left Helsinki on a train destined for Moscow on
October 15.<a id="FNanchor_C6-124" href="#Footnote_C6-124" class="fnanchor">C6-124</a></p>

<p>The Department of State has advised the Commission that it has
some information that in 1959 it usually took an American tourist in
Helsinki 1 to 2 weeks to obtain a visa,<a id="FNanchor_C6-125" href="#Footnote_C6-125" class="fnanchor">C6-125</a> and that it has other information
that the normal waiting period during the past 5 years has been
a week or less.<a id="FNanchor_C6-126" href="#Footnote_C6-126" class="fnanchor">C6-126</a> According to the Department’s information, the
waiting period has always varied frequently and widely, with one
confirmed instance in 1963 of a visa routinely issued in less than
24 hours.<a id="FNanchor_C6-127" href="#Footnote_C6-127" class="fnanchor">C6-127</a> The Central Intelligence Agency has indicated that visas
during the 1964 tourist season were being granted in about 5 to 7
days.<a id="FNanchor_C6-128" href="#Footnote_C6-128" class="fnanchor">C6-128</a></p>

<p>This information from the Department of State and the Central
Intelligence Agency thus suggests that Oswald’s wait for a visa may
have been shorter than usual but not beyond the range of possible
variation. The prompt issuance of Oswald’s visa may have been
merely the result of normal procedures, due in part to the fact that
the summer rush had ended. It might also mean that Oswald was
unusually urgent in his demands that his visa be issued promptly.
Oswald himself told officials at the American Embassy in Moscow on
October 31, when he appeared to renounce his citizenship, that he had
said nothing to the Soviets about defecting until he arrived in Moscow.<a id="FNanchor_C6-129" href="#Footnote_C6-129" class="fnanchor">C6-129</a>
In any event, the Commission has found nothing in the circumstances
of Oswald’s entry into the Soviet Union which indicates
that he was at the time an agent of the U.S.S.R.</p>

<p><i>Defection and admission to residence.</i>—Two months and 22 days
elapsed from Oswald’s arrival in Moscow until he left that city to take
up residence in Minsk. The Commission has considered the possibility
that Oswald was accepted for residence in the Soviet Union and sent
to Minsk unusually soon after he arrived, either because he had been
expected or because during his first weeks in Moscow he developed
an undercover relationship with the Soviet Government. In doing
so, the Commission has attempted to reconstruct the events of those
months, though it is, of course, impossible to account for Oswald’s
activities on every day of that period.</p>

<p>Oswald’s “Historic Diary,”<a id="FNanchor_C6-130" href="#Footnote_C6-130" class="fnanchor">C6-130</a> which commences on October 16, 1959,
the date Oswald arrived in Moscow, and other writings he later prepared,<a id="FNanchor_C6-131" href="#Footnote_C6-131" class="fnanchor">C6-131</a>
have provided the Commission with one source of information
about Oswald’s activities throughout his stay in the Soviet Union.
Even assuming the diary was intended to be a truthful record, it is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
an accurate guide to the details of Oswald’s activities. Oswald seems
not to have been concerned about the accuracy of dates and names,<a id="FNanchor_C6-132" href="#Footnote_C6-132" class="fnanchor">C6-132</a>
and apparently made many of his entries subsequent to the date the
events occurred. Marina Oswald testified that she believed that her
husband did not begin to keep the diary until he reached Minsk, 3
months after his arrival in Russia,<a id="FNanchor_C6-133" href="#Footnote_C6-133" class="fnanchor">C6-133</a> and scraps of paper found in
Oswald’s possession, containing much the same information as appears
in his diary,<a id="FNanchor_C6-134" href="#Footnote_C6-134" class="fnanchor">C6-134</a> suggest that he transcribed the entries into the diary at a
later time. The substance of Oswald’s writings has been carefully
examined for consistency with all other related information available
to the Commission. In addition, the writings have been checked for
handwriting,<a id="FNanchor_C6-135" href="#Footnote_C6-135" class="fnanchor">C6-135</a> and for consistency of style, grammar, and spelling
with earlier and later writings which are known to be his.<a id="FNanchor_C6-136" href="#Footnote_C6-136" class="fnanchor">C6-136</a> No indication
has been found that entries were written or coached by other
persons.<a id="FNanchor_C6-137" href="#Footnote_C6-137" class="fnanchor">C6-137</a></p>

<p>However, the most reliable information concerning the period
Oswald spent in Moscow in the latter part of 1962 comes from the
records of the American Embassy in Moscow,<a id="FNanchor_C6-138" href="#Footnote_C6-138" class="fnanchor">C6-138</a> the testimony of Embassy
officials,<a id="FNanchor_C6-139" href="#Footnote_C6-139" class="fnanchor">C6-139</a> and the notes of two American newspaper reporters,
Aline Mosby <a id="FNanchor_C6-140" href="#Footnote_C6-140" class="fnanchor">C6-140</a> and Priscilla Johnson,<a id="FNanchor_C6-141" href="#Footnote_C6-141" class="fnanchor">C6-141</a> who interviewed Oswald during
this period. Oswald’s correspondence with his brother and mother
has also been relied upon for some relatively minor information.
The findings upon which the Commission based its conclusion concerning
Soviet involvements in the assassination were supported by
evidence other than material provided by the Soviet Union<a id="FNanchor_C6-142" href="#Footnote_C6-142" class="fnanchor">C6-142</a> or
Oswald’s writings. The Central Intelligence Agency has also contributed
data on the normal practices and procedures of the Soviet
authorities in handling American defectors.</p>

<p>The “Historic Diary” indicates that on October 16, 1959, the day
Oswald arrived in Moscow, he told his Intourist guide, Rima
Shirokova, that he wished to renounce his American citizenship and
become a Soviet citizen. The same day, the guide reportedly helped
Oswald prepare a letter to the Soviet authorities requesting citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_C6-143" href="#Footnote_C6-143" class="fnanchor">C6-143</a>
The diary indicates, however, that on October 21 he was
informed that his visa had expired and that he would be required to
leave Moscow within 2 hours.<a id="FNanchor_C6-144" href="#Footnote_C6-144" class="fnanchor">C6-144</a> During the preceding days, according
to the diary, he had been interviewed once and perhaps twice by
Soviet officials.<a id="FNanchor_C6-145" href="#Footnote_C6-145" class="fnanchor">C6-145</a> During this period the KGB,<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> the agency with
primary responsibility for examining defectors arriving in Russia,
undoubtedly investigated Oswald as fully as possible. In 1959, virtually
all Intourist guides were KGB informants, and there is no
reason to believe that this was not true of Oswald’s guide.<a id="FNanchor_C6-146" href="#Footnote_C6-146" class="fnanchor">C6-146</a></p>

<div class="footnoteb">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> The Committee for State Security, best known by its Russian initials, “KGB,” is a
lineal descendant of the revolutionary ChEKA and has passed through numerous changes
of name since 1917 with little change of function. Presently the KGB handles
all Soviet counterintelligence operations and is the instrument for various types of subversive
activities. It is responsible for the internal security of the Soviet state and
the safety of its leaders. In addition it shares responsibility for foreign espionage activities
with the intelligence component of the Ministry of Defense, the “GRU.” The
KGB would have the primary responsibility for keeping track of a defector such as
Oswald.
</p>
<p>
The Ministry of Internal Affairs or “MVD” was for many years the designation of
the organization responsible for civil law enforcement and administration of prisons
and forced labor camps in the Soviet Union. During a part of its history it also directed
vast economic combines. In January 1960, the central or all-union MVD was abolished
and its powers transferred to the MVD’s of the several Soviet republics. A further change
took place in the summer of 1962, when the republic MVD’s were renamed Ministries for
the Preservation of Public Order and Safety. In the past few years the republic MVD’s
have been gradually divesting themselves of their economic functions. When Lee Harvey
Oswald was in the Soviet Union though, the MVD still carried on substantial economic
activities. For example, inmates of the MVD-administered “corrective labor colonies”
engaged in brickmaking, heavy construction work, and lumbering.
</p>
<p>
In the Commission’s report, the term KGB will be used, as above, to describe the principal
Soviet counterintelligence and espionage service. Oswald often inaccurately referred
to the “secret police” as the MVD; and in any quotations from him, the Commission
will reproduce his actual words. Whenever the Commission refers to the MVD, it will be
referring to it as defined in this footnote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p></div>

<p>According to Oswald’s diary he attempted suicide when he learned
his application for citizenship had been denied.<a id="FNanchor_C6-147" href="#Footnote_C6-147" class="fnanchor">C6-147</a> If true, this would
seem to provide strong evidence that, at least prior to October 21,
there was no undercover relationship between Oswald and the Soviet
Government. Though not necessarily conclusive, there is considerable
direct evidence which indicates that Oswald did slash his
wrist. Oswald’s autopsy showed that he had a scar on his left
wrist and that it was of the kind which could have been caused by a
suicide attempt.<a id="FNanchor_C6-148" href="#Footnote_C6-148" class="fnanchor">C6-148</a> The medical records from the Botkinskaya Hospital
in Moscow, furnished by the Soviet Government, reveal that
from October 21 to October 28 he was treated there for a self-inflicted
wound on the left wrist.<a id="FNanchor_C6-149" href="#Footnote_C6-149" class="fnanchor">C6-149</a> The information contained in these records
is consistent with the facts disclosed by the autopsy examination
relating to Oswald’s wrist and to other facts known about Oswald.
Although no witness recalled Oswald mentioning a suicide attempt,<a id="FNanchor_C6-150" href="#Footnote_C6-150" class="fnanchor">C6-150</a>
Marina Oswald testified that when she questioned her husband about
the scar on his wrist, he became “very angry,” and avoided giving
her a reply.<a id="FNanchor_C6-151" href="#Footnote_C6-151" class="fnanchor">C6-151</a> Oswald’s character, discussed in the following chapter,
does not seem inconsistent with a suicide or feigned suicide attempt,
nor with his having failed to disclose the suicide attempt.
Many witnesses who testified before the Commission observed that he
was not an “open” or trusting person, had a tendency toward arrogance,
and was not the kind of man who would readily admit weaknesses.<a id="FNanchor_C6-152" href="#Footnote_C6-152" class="fnanchor">C6-152</a></p>

<p>Oswald appeared at the American Embassy in Moscow on October
31, 1959, 3 days after his release from the Botkinskaya Hospital.<a id="FNanchor_C6-153" href="#Footnote_C6-153" class="fnanchor">C6-153</a>
He did not give the officials at the Embassy any indication that
he had recently received medical treatment.<a id="FNanchor_C6-154" href="#Footnote_C6-154" class="fnanchor">C6-154</a> Oswald’s appearance
was the first notification to the American Government that he was
in Russia, since he had failed to inform the Embassy upon his arrival,<a id="FNanchor_C6-155" href="#Footnote_C6-155" class="fnanchor">C6-155</a>
as most American tourists did at the time.<a id="FNanchor_C6-156" href="#Footnote_C6-156" class="fnanchor">C6-156</a> In appendix XV, Oswald’s
dealings with the Embassy in 1959 until his return to the United
States in 1962 are described in full, and all action taken by the American
officials on his case is evaluated. His conduct at the Embassy has
also been considered by the Commission for any indication it may
provide as to whether or not Oswald was then acting under directions
of the Soviet Government.</p>

<p>NOTE HANDED BY OSWALD TO THE AMERICAN
EMBASSY IN MOSCOW ON OCT. 31, 1959</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
At the Embassy, Oswald declared that he wished to renounce his
U.S. citizenship,<a id="FNanchor_C6-157" href="#Footnote_C6-157" class="fnanchor">C6-157</a> but the consul to whom he spoke, Richard E.
Snyder, refused to accept his renunciation at that time, telling him
that he would have to return to complete the necessary papers.<a id="FNanchor_C6-158" href="#Footnote_C6-158" class="fnanchor">C6-158</a>
However, Oswald did give the consul his passport<a id="FNanchor_C6-159" href="#Footnote_C6-159" class="fnanchor">C6-159</a> and a handwritten
statement requesting that his American citizenship be “revoked”
and “affirm[ing] [his] * * * allegiance” to the Soviet
Union.<a id="FNanchor_C6-160" href="#Footnote_C6-160" class="fnanchor">C6-160</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 913, <a href="#Page_261">p. 261</a>.) The FBI has
confirmed that this statement is in Oswald’s handwriting,<a id="FNanchor_C6-161" href="#Footnote_C6-161" class="fnanchor">C6-161</a> and
Snyder has testified that the letter’s phrases are consistent with the
way Oswald talked and conducted himself.<a id="FNanchor_C6-162" href="#Footnote_C6-162" class="fnanchor">C6-162</a> During the approximately
40-minute interview, Oswald also informed Snyder that he
had been a radar operator in the Marine Corps, intimating that he
might know something of special interest, and that he had informed
a Soviet official that he would give the Soviets any information concerning
the Marine Corps and radar operation which he possessed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-163" href="#Footnote_C6-163" class="fnanchor">C6-163</a>
Although Oswald never filed a formal renunciation, in a letter to
the Embassy dated November 3, 1959, he again requested that his
American citizenship be revoked and protested the refusal to accept
his renunciation on October 31.<a id="FNanchor_C6-164" href="#Footnote_C6-164" class="fnanchor">C6-164</a> (See Commission Exhibit No.
912, <a href="#Page_263">p. 263</a>.)</p>

<p>While at the Embassy,<a id="FNanchor_C6-165" href="#Footnote_C6-165" class="fnanchor">C6-165</a> and in a subsequent interview with an
American journalist,<a id="FNanchor_C6-166" href="#Footnote_C6-166" class="fnanchor">C6-166</a> Oswald displayed familiarity with Communist
ideological arguments, which led those with whom he spoke to speculate
that he may have received some instruction from Soviet authorities.
Oswald’s familiarity with the law regarding renunciation of
citizenship, observed by both Embassy officials,<a id="FNanchor_C6-167" href="#Footnote_C6-167" class="fnanchor">C6-167</a> could also be construed
as a sign of coaching by Soviet authorities. However, Oswald
is known to have been an avid reader<a id="FNanchor_C6-168" href="#Footnote_C6-168" class="fnanchor">C6-168</a> and there is evidence that he
had read Communist literature without guidance while in the Marine
Corps and before that time.<a id="FNanchor_C6-169" href="#Footnote_C6-169" class="fnanchor">C6-169</a> After his arrival in Moscow, Oswald
most probably had discussions with his Intourist guide and others,<a id="FNanchor_C6-170" href="#Footnote_C6-170" class="fnanchor">C6-170</a>
but none of the Americans with whom he talked in Moscow felt that
his conversations necessarily revealed any type of formal training.<a id="FNanchor_C6-171" href="#Footnote_C6-171" class="fnanchor">C6-171</a>
The “Historic Diary” indicates that Oswald did not tell his guide that
he intended to visit the Embassy because he feared she would disapprove.<a id="FNanchor_C6-172" href="#Footnote_C6-172" class="fnanchor">C6-172</a>
(See Commission Exhibit No. 24, <a href="#Page_264">p. 264</a>.) Though Oswald
gave Snyder the impression “of an intelligent person who spoke
in a manner and on a level, which seemed to befit his apparent level of
intelligence,”<a id="FNanchor_C6-173" href="#Footnote_C6-173" class="fnanchor">C6-173</a> correspondent Priscilla Johnson, who spent about 5
hours talking with him,<a id="FNanchor_C6-174" href="#Footnote_C6-174" class="fnanchor">C6-174</a> received a much less favorable impression:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He liked to create the pretense, the impression that he was
attracted to abstract discussion and was capable of engaging in it,
and was drawn to it. But it was like pricking a balloon. I had
the feeling that if you really did engage him on this ground, you
very quickly would discover that he didn’t have the capacity for
a logical sustained argument about an abstract point on
economics or on noneconomic, political matters or any matter,
philosophical.<a id="FNanchor_C6-175" href="#Footnote_C6-175" class="fnanchor">C6-175</a></p></blockquote>

<p>OSWALD’S OWN ACCOUNT OF HIS MEETING AT THE
AMERICAN EMBASSY IN MOSCOW OCT. 31, 1959</p></div></div>

<p>Excerpts from his “Historic Diary”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
A comparison of the formal note Oswald handed Snyder<a id="FNanchor_C6-176" href="#Footnote_C6-176" class="fnanchor">C6-176</a> and his
letter of November 3<a id="FNanchor_C6-177" href="#Footnote_C6-177" class="fnanchor">C6-177</a> with the provisions of section 349(a) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act<a id="FNanchor_C6-178" href="#Footnote_C6-178" class="fnanchor">C6-178</a> suggests that Oswald had read
the statute but understood it imperfectly; he apparently was trying to
use three out of the four ways set out in the statute to surrender his
citizenship, but he succeeded in none.</p>

<p>Moreover, persuasive evidence that Oswald’s conduct was not carefully
coached by Soviet agents is provided by some of his actions
at the Embassy. The single statement which probably caused Oswald
the most future trouble was his declaration that he had already
volunteered to a Soviet official that he would, if asked, tell the Soviet
Government all that he knew about his job in radar as a Marine.
Certainly a statement of this type would prejudice any possibility
of his being an effective pro-Communist agent.</p>

<p>Further, though unquestionably evidencing anti-American sentiments,
Oswald’s behavior at the Embassy, which brought him exceedingly
close to expatriation, was unlikely to have increased his
value in any capacity to the Soviet Union. Richard E. Snyder, the
official who interviewed Oswald on October 31, testified that he “had
every reason to believe” that Oswald would have carried through
a formal—and therefore effective—renunciation of his American
citizenship immediately if he had let him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-179" href="#Footnote_C6-179" class="fnanchor">C6-179</a> However, as a defector,
Oswald could have had considerable propaganda value without expatriating
himself; and if he had expatriated himself his eventual
return to the United States would have been much more difficult
and perhaps impossible. If Snyder’s assessment of Oswald’s intentions
is accurate, it thus tends to refute the suggestion that Oswald
was being coached by the Soviets. In addition, reporters noticed
Oswald’s apparent ambivalence in regard to renouncing his citizenship—stormily
demanding that he be permitted to renounce while
failing to follow through by completing the necessary papers<a id="FNanchor_C6-180" href="#Footnote_C6-180" class="fnanchor">C6-180</a>—behavior
which might have detracted from his propaganda value.</p>

<p>According to Oswald’s “Historic Diary”<a id="FNanchor_C6-181" href="#Footnote_C6-181" class="fnanchor">C6-181</a> and the documents furnished
to the Commission by the Soviet Government,<a id="FNanchor_C6-182" href="#Footnote_C6-182" class="fnanchor">C6-182</a> Oswald was
not told that he had been accepted as a resident of the Soviet Union
until about January 4, 1960. Although on November 13 and 16 Oswald
informed Aline Mosby<a id="FNanchor_C6-183" href="#Footnote_C6-183" class="fnanchor">C6-183</a> and Priscilla Johnson<a id="FNanchor_C6-184" href="#Footnote_C6-184" class="fnanchor">C6-184</a> that he had been
granted permission to remain in the country indefinitely, the diary
indicates that at that time he had been told only that he could remain
“until some solution is found with what to do with me.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-185" href="#Footnote_C6-185" class="fnanchor">C6-185</a> The diary
is more consistent with the letter Oswald wrote to his brother Robert
on December 17, saying that he was then, more than a month after he
saw Johnson and Mosby, about to leave his hotel,<a id="FNanchor_C6-186" href="#Footnote_C6-186" class="fnanchor">C6-186</a> and with some later
correspondence with his mother. Oswald mailed a short note to his
mother which she received in Texas on January 5; that same day she
mailed a money order to him in Moscow, but it apparently got there
too late, because she received it back, unopened, on February 25.<a id="FNanchor_C6-187" href="#Footnote_C6-187" class="fnanchor">C6-187</a>
Oswald’s conflicting statement to the correspondents also seems reconcilable
with his very apparent desire to appear important to others.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
Moreover, so long as Oswald continued to stay in a hotel in Moscow,
the inference is that the Soviet authorities had not yet decided to
accept him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-188" href="#Footnote_C6-188" class="fnanchor">C6-188</a> This inference is supported by information supplied
by the CIA on the handling of other defectors in the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_C6-189" href="#Footnote_C6-189" class="fnanchor">C6-189</a></p>

<p>Thus, the evidence is strong that Oswald waited at least until November
16, when he saw Miss Johnson, and it is probable that he was
required to wait until January 4, a little over 2½ months from October
16, before his application to remain in Russia was granted. In
mid-November Miss Johnson asked Oswald whether the Russians
were encouraging his defection, to which Oswald responded: “The
Russians are treating it like a legal formality. They don’t encourage
you and they don’t discourage you.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-190" href="#Footnote_C6-190" class="fnanchor">C6-190</a> And, when the Soviet Government
finally acted, Oswald did not receive Soviet citizenship, as
he had requested, but merely permission to reside in Russia on a year-to-year
basis.<a id="FNanchor_C6-191" href="#Footnote_C6-191" class="fnanchor">C6-191</a></p>

<p>Asked to comment upon the length of time, 2 months and 22 days,
that probably passed before Oswald was granted the right to remain
in the Soviet Union, the CIA has advised that “when compared to five
other defector cases, this procedure seems unexceptional.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-192" href="#Footnote_C6-192" class="fnanchor">C6-192</a> Similarly,
the Department of State reports that its information “indicated
that a 2-month waiting period is not unusual.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-193" href="#Footnote_C6-193" class="fnanchor">C6-193</a> The full response
of the CIA is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oswald said that he asked for Soviet citizenship on 16 October
1959. According to his diary, he received word a month later
that he could stay in the USSR pending disposition of his request,
but it was another month and a half before he was given
his stateless passport.</p>

<p>When compared to five other defector cases, this procedure
seems unexceptional. Two defectors from US Army intelligence
units in West Germany appear to have been given citizenship
immediately, but both had prior KGB connections and fled
as a result of Army security checks. Of the other three cases,
one was accepted after not more than five weeks and given a
stateless passport apparently at about the same time. The
second was immediately given permission to stay for a while,
and his subsequent request for citizenship was granted three
months later. The third was allowed to stay after he made
his citizenship request, but almost two months passed before he
was told that he had been accepted. Although the Soviet Ministry
of Foreign Affairs soon after told the US Embassy that
he was a Soviet citizen, he did not receive his document until
five or six months after initial application. We know of only
one case in which an American asked for Soviet citizenship but
did not take up residence in the USSR. In that instance, the
American changed his mind and voluntarily returned to the
United States less than three weeks after he had requested Soviet
citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_C6-194" href="#Footnote_C6-194" class="fnanchor">C6-194</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
The Department of State has commented as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The files of the Department of State reflect the fact that
Oswald first applied for permission to remain in Russia permanently,
or at least for a long period, when he arrived in Moscow,
and that he obtained permission to remain within one or two
months.</p>

<p>A. Is the fact that he obtained permission to stay within this
period of time usual?</p>

<p><i>Answer</i>—Our information indicates that a two months waiting
period is not unusual. In the case of [name withheld] the
Supreme Soviet decided within two months to give Soviet citizenship
and he was thereafter, of course, permitted to stay.</p>

<p>B. Can you tell us what the normal procedures are under
similar circumstances?</p>

<p><i>Answer</i>—It is impossible for us to state any “normal” procedures.
The Soviet Government never publicizes the proceedings
in these cases or the reasons for its action. Furthermore, it
is, of course, extremely unusual for an American citizen to
defect.<a id="FNanchor_C6-195" href="#Footnote_C6-195" class="fnanchor">C6-195</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The information relating to Oswald’s suicide attempt indicates
that his application to remain in the Soviet Union was probably rejected
about 6 days after his arrival in Moscow. Since the KGB
is the Soviet agency responsible for the initial handling of all defectors,<a id="FNanchor_C6-196" href="#Footnote_C6-196" class="fnanchor">C6-196</a>
it seems likely that the original decision not to accept Oswald
was made by the KGB. That Oswald was permitted to remain
in Moscow after his release from the hospital suggests that another
ministry of the Soviet Government may have intervened on his
behalf. This hypothesis is consistent with entries in the “Historic
Diary” commenting that the officials Oswald met after his hospital
treatment were different from those with whom he had dealt before.<a id="FNanchor_C6-197" href="#Footnote_C6-197" class="fnanchor">C6-197</a>
The most plausible reason for any such intervention may
well have been apprehension over the publicity that would follow
the rejection of a devout convert to the Communist cause.</p>

<p><i>Oswald’s Life in Minsk.</i>—According to the “Historic Diary”<a id="FNanchor_C6-198" href="#Footnote_C6-198" class="fnanchor">C6-198</a> and
documents received from the Soviet Government,<a id="FNanchor_C6-199" href="#Footnote_C6-199" class="fnanchor">C6-199</a> Oswald
resided in the city of Minsk from January 1960 until June 1962.
Oswald’s life in Minsk is the portion of his life concerning
which the least is known. The primary sources of information
are Oswald’s own writings and the testimony of Marina Oswald.
Other evidence, however, establishes beyond doubt that Oswald
was in fact located in Minsk on at least two occasions. The
Commission has obtained two photographs which were taken by
American tourists in Minsk in August 1961 in which Oswald appears.<a id="FNanchor_C6-200" href="#Footnote_C6-200" class="fnanchor">C6-200</a>
The tourists did not know Oswald, nor did they speak
with him; they remembered only that several men gathered near
their car.<a id="FNanchor_C6-201" href="#Footnote_C6-201" class="fnanchor">C6-201</a> (See Kramer Exhibit 1, <a href="#Page_268">p. 268</a>.) In addition, Oswald
was noticed in Minsk by a student who was traveling with
the University of Michigan band on a tour of Russia in the
spring of 1961.<a id="FNanchor_C6-202" href="#Footnote_C6-202" class="fnanchor">C6-202</a> Oswald corresponded with the American Embassy
in Moscow from Minsk,<a id="FNanchor_C6-203" href="#Footnote_C6-203" class="fnanchor">C6-203</a> and wrote letters from Minsk
to his family in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_C6-204" href="#Footnote_C6-204" class="fnanchor">C6-204</a> Oswald and his wife
have many photographs taken of themselves which show Minsk backgrounds
and persons who are identifiable as residents of Minsk.<a id="FNanchor_C6-205" href="#Footnote_C6-205" class="fnanchor">C6-205</a>
After he returned to the United States, Oswald conversed about the
city with Russian-born American citizens who were familiar with it.<a id="FNanchor_C6-206" href="#Footnote_C6-206" class="fnanchor">C6-206</a>
Marina Oswald is also familiar with the city.<a id="FNanchor_C6-207" href="#Footnote_C6-207" class="fnanchor">C6-207</a> The Commission has
also been able independently to verify the existence in Minsk of many
of the acquaintances of Oswald and his wife whom they said they
knew there.<a id="FNanchor_C6-208" href="#Footnote_C6-208" class="fnanchor">C6-208</a> (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 1392, 1395, 2606, 2609,

Once he was accepted as a resident alien in the Soviet Union, Oswald
was given considerable benefits which ordinary Soviet citizens
in his position in society did not have. The “Historic Diary” recites
that after Oswald was informed that he could remain in the Soviet
Union and was being sent to Minsk he was given 5,000 rubles<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> ($500)
by the “Red Cross, * * * for expenses.” He used 2,200 rubles to pay
his hotel bill, and another 150 rubles to purchase a train ticket. With
the balance of slightly over 2,500 rubles, Oswald felt, according to the
diary, like a rich man.<a id="FNanchor_C6-209" href="#Footnote_C6-209" class="fnanchor">C6-209</a> Oswald did not receive free living quarters,
as the diary indicates the “Mayor” of Minsk promised him,<a id="FNanchor_C6-210" href="#Footnote_C6-210" class="fnanchor">C6-210</a> but about
6 weeks after his arrival he did receive an apartment, very pleasant by
Soviet standards, for which he was required to pay only 60 rubles
($6.00) a month. Oswald considered the apartment “almost rent
free.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-211" href="#Footnote_C6-211" class="fnanchor">C6-211</a> Oswald was given a job in the “Byelorussian Radio and
Television Factory,” where his pay on a per piece basis ranged from
700 to 900 rubles ($70-$90) a month.<a id="FNanchor_C6-212" href="#Footnote_C6-212" class="fnanchor">C6-212</a> According to his wife, this
rate of pay was average for people in his occupation but good by
Soviet standards generally.<a id="FNanchor_C6-213" href="#Footnote_C6-213" class="fnanchor">C6-213</a> She explained that piecework rates
throughout the Soviet Union have generally grown out of line with
compensation for other jobs.<a id="FNanchor_C6-214" href="#Footnote_C6-214" class="fnanchor">C6-214</a> The CIA has confirmed that this condition
exists in many areas and occupations in the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_C6-215" href="#Footnote_C6-215" class="fnanchor">C6-215</a> In
addition to his salary, Oswald regularly received 700 rubles ($70) per
month from the Soviet “Red Cross.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-216" href="#Footnote_C6-216" class="fnanchor">C6-216</a> The well-paying job, the
monthly subsidy, and the “almost rent-free” apartment combined to
give Oswald more money than he needed. The only complaint recorded
in the “Historic Diary” is that there was “no place to spend
the money.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-217" href="#Footnote_C6-217" class="fnanchor">C6-217</a></p>

<div class="footnoteb">

<p><a id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> About a year after Oswald received this money, the ruble was revalued to about 10 times
its earlier value.</p></div>

<p>The Commission has found no basis for associating Oswald’s preferred
income with Soviet undercover activity. Marina Oswald testified
that foreign nationals are commonly given special treatment in
the Soviet Union,<a id="FNanchor_C6-218" href="#Footnote_C6-218" class="fnanchor">C6-218</a> and the Central Intelligence Agency has confirmed
that it is standard practice in the Soviet Union for Americans
and other foreign defectors from countries with high standards
of living to be “subsidized.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-219" href="#Footnote_C6-219" class="fnanchor">C6-219</a> Apparently it is Soviet practice
to attempt to make life sufficiently pleasant for a foreign defector so
that he will not become disillusioned and return to his native country.
The Commission has also assumed that it is customary for Soviet intelligence
agencies to keep defectors under surveillance during their
residence in the Soviet Union, through periodic interviews of neighbors
and associates of the defector.<a id="FNanchor_C6-220" href="#Footnote_C6-220" class="fnanchor">C6-220</a> Oswald once mentioned that the
Soviet police questioned his neighbors occasionally.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-221" href="#Footnote_C6-221" class="fnanchor">C6-221</a></p>

Moreover, it is from Oswald’s personal writings alone that the Commission
has learned that he received supplementary funds from the
Soviet “Red Cross.” In the notes he made during the return trip
to the United States Oswald recognized that the “Red Cross” subsidy
had nothing to do with the well-known International Red Cross. He
frankly stated that the money was paid to him for having “denounced”
the United States and that it had come from the “MVD.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-222" href="#Footnote_C6-222" class="fnanchor">C6-222</a> Oswald’s
papers reveal that the “Red Cross” subsidy was terminated
as soon as he wrote the American Embassy in Moscow in February
1961 asking that he be permitted to return.<a id="FNanchor_C6-223" href="#Footnote_C6-223" class="fnanchor">C6-223</a> (See Commission Exhibit
No. 25, <a href="#Page_273">p. 273</a>.) Marina Oswald’s testimony confirmed this;
she said that when she knew Oswald he no longer was receiving the
monthly grant but still retained some of the savings accumulated in
the months when he had been receiving it.<a id="FNanchor_C6-224" href="#Footnote_C6-224" class="fnanchor">C6-224</a> Since she met Oswald in
March and married him in April of 1961, her testimony was consistent
with his records.</p>

<p>The nature of Oswald’s employment while in Minsk has been examined
by the Commission. The factory in which he worked was a
large plant manufacturing electronic parts and radio and television
sets. Marina Oswald has testified that he was an “apprentice machinist”
and “ground small metallic parts for radio receivers, on a
lathe.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-225" href="#Footnote_C6-225" class="fnanchor">C6-225</a> So far as can be determined, Oswald never straightforwardly
described to anyone else in the United States exactly what
his job was in the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_C6-226" href="#Footnote_C6-226" class="fnanchor">C6-226</a> Some of his acquaintances in
Dallas and Fort Worth had the impression that he was disappointed
in having been given a menial job and not assigned to an institution
of higher learning in the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_C6-227" href="#Footnote_C6-227" class="fnanchor">C6-227</a> Marina Oswald confirmed
this and also testified that her husband was not interested in his work
and not regarded at the factory as a very good worker.<a id="FNanchor_C6-228" href="#Footnote_C6-228" class="fnanchor">C6-228</a> The documents
furnished to the Commission by the Soviet government were
consistent with her testimony on this point, since they included a report
from Oswald’s superior at the factory which is critical of his
performance on the job.<a id="FNanchor_C6-229" href="#Footnote_C6-229" class="fnanchor">C6-229</a> Oswald’s employment and his job performance
are thus consistent with his known occupational habits in
this country and otherwise afford no ground for suspicion.</p>

<p>Oswald’s membership in a hunting club while he was in the Soviet
Union has been a matter of special interest to the Commission. One
Russian emigre testified that this was a suspicious circumstance because
no one in the Soviet Union is permitted to own a gun for
pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_C6-230" href="#Footnote_C6-230" class="fnanchor">C6-230</a> The Commission’s investigation, however, has established
that this is not so. The Central Intelligence Agency has
advised the Commission that hunting societies such as the one to
which Oswald belonged are very popular in the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_C6-231" href="#Footnote_C6-231" class="fnanchor">C6-231</a> They
are frequently sponsored by factories for their employees, as was
Oswald’s.<a id="FNanchor_C6-232" href="#Footnote_C6-232" class="fnanchor">C6-232</a> Moreover, Soviet citizens (or foreigners residing in the
Soviet Union) are permitted to own shotguns, but not rifles, without
joining a society; all that is necessary is that the gun be registered
at the local militia office immediately after it has been purchased.<a id="FNanchor_C6-233" href="#Footnote_C6-233" class="fnanchor">C6-233</a>
Experts from the Central Intelligence Agency have examined Oswald’s
club membership certificate and gun permit and expressed
the opinion that its terms and numbers are consistent with other information
the CIA has about the Soviet Union.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-234" href="#Footnote_C6-234" class="fnanchor">C6-234</a></p>

FROM THE U. S. S. R. WITH HIS FAMILY</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
Marina Oswald testified that her husband went hunting only on one
occasion during the time of their marriage.<a id="FNanchor_C6-235" href="#Footnote_C6-235" class="fnanchor">C6-235</a> However, Oswald
apparently joined the Byelorussian Society of Hunters and Fishermen
in the summer of 1960<a id="FNanchor_C6-236" href="#Footnote_C6-236" class="fnanchor">C6-236</a> and did not marry until April 30, 1961,<a id="FNanchor_C6-237" href="#Footnote_C6-237" class="fnanchor">C6-237</a>
so he could have been more active while he was still a bachelor.
Oswald made no secret of his membership in the hunting club. He
mentioned it on occasion to friends after he returned to the United
States;<a id="FNanchor_C6-238" href="#Footnote_C6-238" class="fnanchor">C6-238</a> discussed it at some length in a speech at a Jesuit Seminary
in Mobile, Ala., in the summer of 1962;<a id="FNanchor_C6-239" href="#Footnote_C6-239" class="fnanchor">C6-239</a> included it in his correspondence
with his brother Robert;<a id="FNanchor_C6-240" href="#Footnote_C6-240" class="fnanchor">C6-240</a> and kept his membership certificate<a id="FNanchor_C6-241" href="#Footnote_C6-241" class="fnanchor">C6-241</a>
and gun permit<a id="FNanchor_C6-242" href="#Footnote_C6-242" class="fnanchor">C6-242</a> until the day he was killed. In view of
these facts, it is unlikely that Oswald’s membership in a hunting club
was contrived to conceal some sort of secret training. Moreover, the
CIA has informed the Commission that it is in possession of considerable
information on the location of secret Soviet training institutions
and that it knows of no such institution in or near Minsk
during the time Oswald was there.<a id="FNanchor_C6-243" href="#Footnote_C6-243" class="fnanchor">C6-243</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s marriage to Marina Prusakova on April 30, 1961,<a id="FNanchor_C6-244" href="#Footnote_C6-244" class="fnanchor">C6-244</a> is itself
a fact meriting consideration. A foreigner living in Russia cannot
marry without the permission of the Soviet Government.<a id="FNanchor_C6-245" href="#Footnote_C6-245" class="fnanchor">C6-245</a> It seems
unlikely that the Soviet authorities would have permitted Oswald to
marry and to take his wife with him to the United States if they
were contemplating using him alone as an agent. The fact that he
had a Russian wife would be likely, in their view, to increase any
surveillance under which he would be kept by American security
agencies, would make him even more conspicuous to his neighbors as
“an ex-Russian,” and would decrease his mobility. A wife’s presence
in the United States would also constitute a continuing risk of disclosure.
On the other hand, Marina Oswald’s lack of English training
and her complete ignorance of the United States and its customs<a id="FNanchor_C6-246" href="#Footnote_C6-246" class="fnanchor">C6-246</a>
would scarcely recommend her to the Soviet authorities as one
member of an “agent team” to be sent to the United States on a difficult
and dangerous foreign enterprise.</p>

<p><i>Oswald’s departure from the Soviet Union.</i>—On February 13, 1961,
the American Embassy in Moscow received a letter from Oswald
postmarked Minsk, February 5, asking that he be readmitted to the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_C6-247" href="#Footnote_C6-247" class="fnanchor">C6-247</a> This was the first time that the Embassy had heard
from or about Oswald since November 16, 1959.<a id="FNanchor_C6-248" href="#Footnote_C6-248" class="fnanchor">C6-248</a> The end of the
15-month silence came only a few days after the Department of State<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
in Washington had forwarded a request to the Moscow Embassy on
February 1, 1961, informing the Embassy that Oswald’s mother was
worried about him, and asking that he get in touch with her if possible.<a id="FNanchor_C6-249" href="#Footnote_C6-249" class="fnanchor">C6-249</a>
The simultaneity of the two events was apparently coincidental.
The request from Marguerite Oswald went from Washington
to Moscow by sealed diplomatic pouch and there was no
evidence that the seal had been tampered with.<a id="FNanchor_C6-250" href="#Footnote_C6-250" class="fnanchor">C6-250</a> The officer of the
Department of State who carried the responsibility for such matters
has testified that the message was not forwarded to the Russians after
it arrived in Moscow.<a id="FNanchor_C6-251" href="#Footnote_C6-251" class="fnanchor">C6-251</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s letter does not seem to have been designed to ingratiate
him with the Embassy officials. It starts by incorrectly implying
that he had written an earlier letter that was not answered, states
that he will return to the United States only if he can first “come to
some agreement” on there being no legal charges brought against
him, and ends with a reminder to the officials at the Embassy that
they have a responsibility to do everything they can to help him, since
he is an American citizen.<a id="FNanchor_C6-252" href="#Footnote_C6-252" class="fnanchor">C6-252</a></p>

<p>The Embassy’s response to this letter was to invite Oswald to come
personally to Moscow to discuss the matter.<a id="FNanchor_C6-253" href="#Footnote_C6-253" class="fnanchor">C6-253</a> Oswald at first protested
because of the difficulty of obtaining Soviet permission.<a id="FNanchor_C6-254" href="#Footnote_C6-254" class="fnanchor">C6-254</a> He
wrote two more protesting letters during the following 4 months,<a id="FNanchor_C6-255" href="#Footnote_C6-255" class="fnanchor">C6-255</a>
but received no indication that the Embassy would allow him to handle
the matter by mail.<a id="FNanchor_C6-256" href="#Footnote_C6-256" class="fnanchor">C6-256</a> While the Department of State was clarifying
its position on this matter,<a id="FNanchor_C6-257" href="#Footnote_C6-257" class="fnanchor">C6-257</a> Oswald unexpectedly appeared in Moscow
on Saturday, July 8, 1961.<a id="FNanchor_C6-258" href="#Footnote_C6-258" class="fnanchor">C6-258</a> On Sunday, Marina Oswald flew to
Moscow,<a id="FNanchor_C6-259" href="#Footnote_C6-259" class="fnanchor">C6-259</a> and was interviewed by officials in the American Embassy
on Tuesday.<a id="FNanchor_C6-260" href="#Footnote_C6-260" class="fnanchor">C6-260</a></p>

<p>The Commission asked the Department of State and the Central
Intelligence Agency to comment on whether the Oswalds’ travel to
Moscow without permission signified special treatment by the Soviet
Union. From their responses, it appears that since Marina Oswald
possessed a Soviet citizen’s internal passport, she did not require prior
approval to make the trip.<a id="FNanchor_C6-261" href="#Footnote_C6-261" class="fnanchor">C6-261</a> Although Soviet law did require her
husband, as the holder of a “stateless passport,” to obtain advance
permission for the trip, his failure to do so would not normally have
been considered a serious violation. In this respect, the CIA has
advised the Commission as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>OSWALD’S travel from Minsk to Moscow and return in July
1961 would normally have required prior authorization. Bearers
of a Soviet “passport for foreigners” (<em>vid na zhitelstov v. SSSR
dlya innostrantsa</em>) are required to obtain travel authorization
from the Visa and Registration Department (OVIR) (or Passport
Registration Department (PRO) in smaller towns) if they
desire to leave the city (or oblast) where they are domiciled.
This same requirement is believed to apply to persons, such as
OSWALD, holding Soviet “stateless passports” (<em>vid na zhitelstvo</em>
v. <em>SSSR dlya lits bez grazhdanstva</em>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
The practicality of even “unauthorized” travel was demonstrated
by events related by a United States citizen who defected
in 1960, and subsequently was sent to Kiev to study. After repatriating
this defector told U.S. authorities he had made a total
of seven unauthorized trips from Kiev during his stay in the
USSR. He was apprehended on two of his flights and was returned
to Kiev each time, the second time under escort. On both
occasions he was merely reprimanded by the deputy chief of the
institute at which he was studying. Since Marina had a Soviet
citizen’s internal passport there would have been no restrictions
against her making the trip to Moscow.<a id="FNanchor_C6-262" href="#Footnote_C6-262" class="fnanchor">C6-262</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The answers of the Department of State, together with the Commission’s
specific questions, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>B. Could resident foreigners normally travel in this manner
without first obtaining such permission?</p>

<p><i>Answer</i>—There are only a few U.S. nationals now living in
the Soviet Union. They include an American Roman Catholic
priest, an American Protestant minister, a number of correspondents,
some students and technical advisers to Soviet businesses.
We know that the priest, the minister, the correspondents and
the students must obtain permission from Soviet authorities before
taking any trips. The technical advisers notify officials of
their project before they travel and these officials personally
inform the militia.</p>

<p>C. If travel of this type was not freely permitted, do you believe
that Oswald normally would have been apprehended during
the attempt or punished after the fact for traveling without
permission?</p>

<p><i>Answer</i>—Based on the information we have, we believe that if
Oswald went to Moscow without permission, and this was known
to the Soviet authorities, he would have been fined or reprimanded.
Oswald was not, of course, an average foreign resident. He was
a defector from a foreign country and the bearer of a Soviet
internal “stateless” passport * * * during the time when he was
contemplating the visit to Moscow to come to the Embassy * * *</p>

<p>The Soviet authorities probably knew about Oswald’s trip even
if he did not obtain advance permission, since in most instances the
Soviet militia guards at the Embassy ask for the documents of
unidentified persons entering the Embassy grounds * * *</p>

<p>An American citizen who, with her American citizen husband,
went to the Soviet Union to live permanently and is now trying
to obtain permission to leave, informed the Embassy that she had
been fined for not getting permission to go from Odessa to Moscow
on a recent trip to visit the Embassy.</p>

<p>D. Even if such travel did not have to be authorized, do you
have any information or observations regarding the practicality
of such travel by Soviet citizens or persons in Oswald’s status?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
<i>Answer</i>—It is impossible to generalize in this area. We understand
from interrogations of former residents in the Soviet Union
who were considered “stateless” by Soviet authorities that they
were not permitted to leave the town where they resided without
permission of the police. In requesting such permission they
were required to fill out a questionnaire giving the reason for
travel, length of stay, addresses of individuals to be visited, etc.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these requirements, we know that at least one
“stateless” person often traveled without permission of the authorities
and stated that police stationed at railroad stations
usually spotchecked the identification papers of every tenth
traveler, but that it was an easy matter to avoid such checks.
Finally, she stated that persons who were caught evading the
registration requirements were returned to their home towns by
the police and sentenced to short jail terms and fined. These
sentences were more severe for repeated violations.<a id="FNanchor_C6-263" href="#Footnote_C6-263" class="fnanchor">C6-263</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When Oswald arrived at the Embassy in Moscow, he met Richard
E. Snyder, the same person with whom he had dealt in October of
1959.<a id="FNanchor_C6-264" href="#Footnote_C6-264" class="fnanchor">C6-264</a> Primarily on the basis of Oswald’s interview with Snyder on
Monday, July 10, 1961, the American Embassy concluded that Oswald
had not expatriated himself.<a id="FNanchor_C6-265" href="#Footnote_C6-265" class="fnanchor">C6-265</a> (See app. XV, <a href="#Page_752">pp. 752-760</a>.) On the
basis of this tentative decision, Oswald was given back his American
passport, which he had surrendered in 1959.<a id="FNanchor_C6-266" href="#Footnote_C6-266" class="fnanchor">C6-266</a> The document was
due to expire in September 1961,<a id="FNanchor_C6-267" href="#Footnote_C6-267" class="fnanchor">C6-267</a> however, and Oswald was informed
that its renewal would depend upon the ultimate decision by the Department
of State on his expatriation.<a id="FNanchor_C6-268" href="#Footnote_C6-268" class="fnanchor">C6-268</a> On July 11, Marina Oswald
was interviewed at the Embassy and the steps necessary for her to
obtain an American visa were begun.<a id="FNanchor_C6-269" href="#Footnote_C6-269" class="fnanchor">C6-269</a> In May 1962, after 15 months
of dealings with the Embassy, Oswald’s passport was ultimately renewed
and permission for his wife to enter the United States was
granted.<a id="FNanchor_C6-270" href="#Footnote_C6-270" class="fnanchor">C6-270</a></p>

<p>The files on Oswald and his wife compiled by the Department of
State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service contain no
indication of any expert guidance by Soviet authorities in Oswald’s
dealings with the Department or the Service. For example, the
letters from Minsk to the Embassy in Moscow,<a id="FNanchor_C6-271" href="#Footnote_C6-271" class="fnanchor">C6-271</a> which are in his
handwriting,<a id="FNanchor_C6-272" href="#Footnote_C6-272" class="fnanchor">C6-272</a> display the arrogant attitude which was characteristic
of him both before and after he lived in Russia, and, when compared
with other letters that were without doubt composed and
written by him,<a id="FNanchor_C6-273" href="#Footnote_C6-273" class="fnanchor">C6-273</a> show about the same low level of sophistication,
fluency, and spelling. The Department officer who most frequently
dealt with Oswald when he began negotiations to return to the
United States, Richard E. Snyder, testified that he can recall nothing
that indicated Oswald was being guided or assisted by a third party
when he appeared at the Embassy in July 1961.<a id="FNanchor_C6-274" href="#Footnote_C6-274" class="fnanchor">C6-274</a> On the contrary,
the arrogant and presumptuous attitude which Oswald displayed in
his correspondence with the Embassy from early 1961 until June
1962,<a id="FNanchor_C6-275" href="#Footnote_C6-275" class="fnanchor">C6-275</a> when he finally departed from Russia, undoubtedly hindered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
his attempts to return to the United States. Snyder has testified that
although he made a sincere effort to treat Oswald’s application objectively,
Oswald’s attitude made this very difficult.<a id="FNanchor_C6-276" href="#Footnote_C6-276" class="fnanchor">C6-276</a></p>

<p>In order to leave Russia, it was also necessary for the Oswalds to
obtain permission from the Soviet Government. The timing and
circumstances under which the Oswalds obtained this permission
have also been considered by the Commission. Marina Oswald, although
her memory is not clear on the point, said that she and Oswald
first made their intentions to go to the United States known to
Soviet officials in Minsk in May, even before coming to Moscow in
July for the conference at the American Embassy.<a id="FNanchor_C6-277" href="#Footnote_C6-277" class="fnanchor">C6-277</a> The Oswalds’
correspondence with the Embassy and the documents furnished the
Commission by the Soviet Government show that the Oswalds made
a series of formal applications to the Soviets from July 15 to August
21.<a id="FNanchor_C6-278" href="#Footnote_C6-278" class="fnanchor">C6-278</a> Presumably the most difficult question for the Soviet
authorities was whether to allow Marina Oswald to accompany her
husband. She was called to the local passport office in Minsk on
December 25, 1961, and told that authority had been received to
issue exit visas to her and Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-279" href="#Footnote_C6-279" class="fnanchor">C6-279</a> Obtaining the permission of
the Soviet Government to leave may have been aided by a conference
which Marina Oswald had, at her own request, with a local MVD official,
Colonel Aksenov, sometime in late 1961. She testified that she
applied for the conference at her husband’s urging, after he had tried
unsuccessfully to arrange such a conference for himself.<a id="FNanchor_C6-280" href="#Footnote_C6-280" class="fnanchor">C6-280</a> She believed
that it may have been granted her because her uncle with whom
she had lived in Minsk before her marriage was also an MVD official.<a id="FNanchor_C6-281" href="#Footnote_C6-281" class="fnanchor">C6-281</a></p>

<p>The correspondence with the American Embassy at this time reflected
that the Oswalds did not pick up their exit visas immediately.<a id="FNanchor_C6-282" href="#Footnote_C6-282" class="fnanchor">C6-282</a>
On January 11, 1962, Marina Oswald was issued her Soviet exit visa.
It was marked valid until December 1, 1962.<a id="FNanchor_C6-283" href="#Footnote_C6-283" class="fnanchor">C6-283</a> The Oswalds did
not leave Russia until June 1962, but the additional delay was caused
by problems with the U.S. Government and by the birth of a child in
February.<a id="FNanchor_C6-284" href="#Footnote_C6-284" class="fnanchor">C6-284</a> Permission of the Soviet authorities to leave, once given,
was never revoked. Oswald told the FBI in July 1962, shortly after
he returned to the United States, that he had been interviewed by
the MVD twice, once when he first came to the Soviet Union and
once just before he departed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-285" href="#Footnote_C6-285" class="fnanchor">C6-285</a> His wife testified that the second
interview did not occur in Moscow but that she and her husband dealt
with the MVD visa officials frequently in Minsk.<a id="FNanchor_C6-286" href="#Footnote_C6-286" class="fnanchor">C6-286</a></p>

<p>Investigation of the circumstances, including the timing, under
which the Oswalds obtained permission from the Soviet Government
to leave Russia for the United States show that they differed in no
discernible manner from the normal. The Central Intelligence
Agency has informed the Commission that normally a Soviet national
would not be permitted to emigrate if he might endanger Soviet
national security once he went abroad.<a id="FNanchor_C6-287" href="#Footnote_C6-287" class="fnanchor">C6-287</a> Those persons in possession
of confidential information, for example, would constitute an important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
category of such “security risks.” Apparently Oswald’s
predeparture interview by the MVD was part of an attempt to
ascertain whether he or his wife had access to any confidential
information. Marina Oswald’s reported interview with the MVD
in late 1961, which was arranged at her request, may have served the
same purpose. The Commission’s awareness of both interviews
derives entirely from Oswald’s and his wife’s statements and letters
to the American Embassy, which afford additional evidence that the
conferences carried no subversive significance.</p>

<p>It took the Soviet authorities at least 5½ months, from about July
15, 1961, until late December, to grant permission for the Oswalds
to leave the country. When asked to comment upon the alleged rapidity
of the Oswalds’ departure, the Department of State advised the
Commission:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * In the immediate post-war period there were about fifteen
marriages in which the wife had been waiting for many years
for a Soviet exit permit. After the death of Stalin the Soviet
Government showed a disposition to settle these cases. In the
summer of 1953 permission was given for all of this group of
Soviet citizen wives to accompany their American citizen husbands
to the United States.</p>

<p>Since this group was given permission to leave the Soviet Union,
there have been from time to time marriages in the Soviet Union
of American citizens and Soviet citizens. With one exception, it
is our understanding that all of the Soviet citizens involved have
been given permission to emigrate to the United States after waiting
periods which were, in some cases from three to six months
and in others much longer.<a id="FNanchor_C6-288" href="#Footnote_C6-288" class="fnanchor">C6-288</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Both the Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency
compiled data for the Commission on Soviet wives of American citizens
who received exit visas to leave the Soviet Union, where the relevant
information was available. In both cases the data were consistent
with the above conclusion of the State Department. The Department
of State had sufficient information to measure the timespan in 14 cases.
The Department points out that it has information on the dates of
application for and receipt of Soviet exit visas only on those cases
that have been brought to its attention. A common reason for bringing
a case to the attention of the Department is that the granting of
the exit visa by the Soviet Union has been delayed, so that the American
spouse seeks the assistance of his own government. It therefore
appears that the sampling data carry a distinct bias toward lengthy
waiting periods. Of the 14 cases tested, 6 involve women who applied
for visas after 1953, when the liberalized post-Stalin policy was in
effect. The approximate waiting periods for these wives were, in
decreasing order, 13 months, 6 months, 3 months, 1 month, and 10
days.<a id="FNanchor_C6-289" href="#Footnote_C6-289" class="fnanchor">C6-289</a> Of the 11 cases examined by the Central Intelligence Agency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
in which the time period is known or can be inferred, the Soviet wives
had to wait from 5 months to a year to obtain exit visas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-290" href="#Footnote_C6-290" class="fnanchor">C6-290</a></p>

<p>In his correspondence with the American Embassy and his brother
while he was in Russia,<a id="FNanchor_C6-291" href="#Footnote_C6-291" class="fnanchor">C6-291</a> in his diary,<a id="FNanchor_C6-292" href="#Footnote_C6-292" class="fnanchor">C6-292</a> and in his conversations
with people in the United States after he returned,<a id="FNanchor_C6-293" href="#Footnote_C6-293" class="fnanchor">C6-293</a> Oswald claimed
that his wife had been subjected to pressure by the Soviet Government
in an effort to induce her not to emigrate to the United States. In the
Embassy correspondence, Oswald claimed that the pressure had been
so intense that she had to be hospitalized for 5 days for “nervous exhaustion.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-294" href="#Footnote_C6-294" class="fnanchor">C6-294</a>
Marina Oswald testified that her husband exaggerated
and that no such hospitalization or “nervous exhaustion” ever
occurred.<a id="FNanchor_C6-295" href="#Footnote_C6-295" class="fnanchor">C6-295</a> However, she did testify that she was questioned on the
matter occasionally and given the impression that her government
was not pleased with her decision.<a id="FNanchor_C6-296" href="#Footnote_C6-296" class="fnanchor">C6-296</a> Her aunt and uncle in Minsk did
not speak to her “for a long time”; she also stated that she was dropped
from membership in the Communist Youth Organization (Komsomol)
when the news of her visit to the American Embassy in
Moscow reached that organization.<a id="FNanchor_C6-297" href="#Footnote_C6-297" class="fnanchor">C6-297</a> A student who took Russian
lessons from her in Texas testified that she once referred to the days
when the pressure was applied as “a very horrible time.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-298" href="#Footnote_C6-298" class="fnanchor">C6-298</a> Despite all
this Marina Oswald testified that she was surprised that their visas
were granted as soon as they were—and that hers was granted at all.<a id="FNanchor_C6-299" href="#Footnote_C6-299" class="fnanchor">C6-299</a>
This evidence thus indicates that the Soviet authorities, rather than
facilitating the departure of the Oswalds, first tried to dissuade
Marina Oswald from going to the United States and then, when she
failed to respond to the pressure, permitted her to leave without undue
delay. There are indications that the Soviet treatment of another
recent defector who left the Soviet Union to return to the United
States resembled that accorded to the Oswalds.<a id="FNanchor_C6-300" href="#Footnote_C6-300" class="fnanchor">C6-300</a></p>

<p>On the basis of all the foregoing evidence, the Commission concluded
that there was no reason to believe that the Oswalds received unusually
favorable treatment in being permitted to leave the Soviet Union.</p>

<h4 id="hdr128">Associations in the Dallas-Fort Worth Community</h4>

<p><i>The Russian-speaking community.</i>—Shortly after his return from
Russia in June 1962, Oswald and his family settled in Fort Worth,
Tex., where they met a group of Russian-born or Russian-speaking
persons in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.<a id="FNanchor_C6-301" href="#Footnote_C6-301" class="fnanchor">C6-301</a> The members of this community
were attracted to each other by common background, language,
and culture. Many of them were well-educated, accomplished, and
industrious people, several being connected with the oil exploration,
production, and processing industry that flourishes in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area.<a id="FNanchor_C6-302" href="#Footnote_C6-302" class="fnanchor">C6-302</a> As described more fully in chapter VII
and in appendix XIII, many of these persons assisted the Oswalds
in various ways. Some provided the Oswalds with gifts of such
things as food, clothing, and baby furniture.<a id="FNanchor_C6-303" href="#Footnote_C6-303" class="fnanchor">C6-303</a> Some arranged
appointments and transportation for medical and dental treatment,
and assumed the cost in some instances.<a id="FNanchor_C6-304" href="#Footnote_C6-304" class="fnanchor">C6-304</a> When Oswald undertook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
to look for employment in Dallas in early October of 1962 and
again when marital difficulties arose between the Oswalds in November
of the same year, Marina Oswald and their child were housed at times
in the homes of various members of the group.<a id="FNanchor_C6-305" href="#Footnote_C6-305" class="fnanchor">C6-305</a> The Commission
has examined the background of many of these individuals and has
thoroughly investigated Oswald’s relationship with them.</p>

<p>There is no basis to suppose that Oswald came to Fort Worth upon
his return from Russia for the purpose of establishing contacts with
the Russian-speaking community located in that area. Oswald had
spent several of his grammar-school years in Fort Worth.<a id="FNanchor_C6-306" href="#Footnote_C6-306" class="fnanchor">C6-306</a> In 1962,
his brother Robert lived in Fort Worth and his mother resided in
nearby Vernon, Tex. In January of that year, Oswald indicated to
American officials in Russia that he intended to stay with his mother
upon his return to the United States; however, sometime after mid-February,
he received an invitation to stay with Robert and his
family until he became settled, and he did spend the first several weeks
after his return at Robert’s home.<a id="FNanchor_C6-307" href="#Footnote_C6-307" class="fnanchor">C6-307</a> In July, Oswald’s mother moved
to Fort Worth and Oswald and his wife and child moved into an
apartment with her.<a id="FNanchor_C6-308" href="#Footnote_C6-308" class="fnanchor">C6-308</a> While in that apartment, Oswald located a
job in Fort Worth and then rented and moved with his family into
an apartment on Mercedes Street.<a id="FNanchor_C6-309" href="#Footnote_C6-309" class="fnanchor">C6-309</a></p>

<p>Upon his arrival in 1962, Oswald did not know any members of the
relatively small and loosely knit Russian-speaking community.<a id="FNanchor_C6-310" href="#Footnote_C6-310" class="fnanchor">C6-310</a>
Shortly after his arrival Oswald obtained the name of two Russian-speaking
persons in Fort Worth from the office of the Texas Employment
Commission in that city.<a id="FNanchor_C6-311" href="#Footnote_C6-311" class="fnanchor">C6-311</a> Attempts to arrange a prompt visit
with one of them failed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-312" href="#Footnote_C6-312" class="fnanchor">C6-312</a> The second person, Peter Paul Gregory,
was a consulting petroleum engineer and part-time Russian-language
instructor at the Fort Worth Public Library. Oswald contacted him
in order to obtain a letter certifying to his proficiency in Russian
and Marina Oswald later tutored his son in the Russian language.<a id="FNanchor_C6-313" href="#Footnote_C6-313" class="fnanchor">C6-313</a>
Gregory introduced the Oswalds to George Bouhe and Anna Meller,
both of whom lived in Dallas and became interested in the welfare of
Marina Oswald and her child.<a id="FNanchor_C6-314" href="#Footnote_C6-314" class="fnanchor">C6-314</a> Through them, other members of the
Russian community became acquainted with the Oswalds.<a id="FNanchor_C6-315" href="#Footnote_C6-315" class="fnanchor">C6-315</a></p>

<p>The Oswalds met some 30 persons in the Russian-speaking
community, of whom 25 testified before the Commission or its staff;
others were interviewed on behalf of the Commission.<a id="FNanchor_C6-316" href="#Footnote_C6-316" class="fnanchor">C6-316</a> This range of
testimony has disclosed that the relationship between Lee Harvey
Oswald and the Russian-speaking community was short lived and
generally quite strained.<a id="FNanchor_C6-317" href="#Footnote_C6-317" class="fnanchor">C6-317</a> During October and November of 1962
Marina Oswald lived at the homes of some of the members of the Russian-speaking
community.<a id="FNanchor_C6-318" href="#Footnote_C6-318" class="fnanchor">C6-318</a> She stayed first with Elena Hall while
Oswald was looking for work in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-319" href="#Footnote_C6-319" class="fnanchor">C6-319</a> In early November, Marina
Oswald and the baby joined Oswald in Dallas, but soon thereafter,
she spent approximately 2 weeks with different Russian-speaking
friends during another separation.<a id="FNanchor_C6-320" href="#Footnote_C6-320" class="fnanchor">C6-320</a> Oswald openly resented the
help Marina’s “Russian friends” gave to him and his wife and the
efforts of some of them to induce Marina to leave him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-321" href="#Footnote_C6-321" class="fnanchor">C6-321</a> George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
Bouhe attempted to dissuade Marina from returning to her husband
in November 1962, and when she rejoined him, Bouhe became displeased
with her as well.<a id="FNanchor_C6-322" href="#Footnote_C6-322" class="fnanchor">C6-322</a> Relations between the Oswalds and the
members of the Russian community had practically ceased by the end
of 1962. Katherine Ford, one of the members of the group, summed
up the situation as it existed at the end of January 1963: “So it was
rather, sort of, Marina and her husband were dropped at that time,
nobody actually wanted to help. * * *”<a id="FNanchor_C6-323" href="#Footnote_C6-323" class="fnanchor">C6-323</a></p>

<p>In April of 1963, Oswald left Fort Worth for New Orleans, where
he was later joined by his wife and daughter, and remained until
his trip to Mexico City in late September and his subsequent return
to the Dallas-Fort Worth area in early October of 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-324" href="#Footnote_C6-324" class="fnanchor">C6-324</a> With only
minor exceptions,<a id="FNanchor_C6-325" href="#Footnote_C6-325" class="fnanchor">C6-325</a> there is no evidence that any member of the
Russian-speaking community had further contact with Oswald or
his family after April.<a id="FNanchor_C6-326" href="#Footnote_C6-326" class="fnanchor">C6-326</a> In New Orleans, Oswald made no attempt
to make new Russian-speaking acquaintances for his wife
and there is no evidence that he developed any friendships in that
city.<a id="FNanchor_C6-327" href="#Footnote_C6-327" class="fnanchor">C6-327</a> Similarly, after the return from New Orleans, there seems
to have been no communication between the Oswalds and this group
until the evening of November 22, 1963, when the Dallas Police
enlisted Ilya Mamantov to serve as an interpreter for them in their
questioning of Marina Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-328" href="#Footnote_C6-328" class="fnanchor">C6-328</a></p>

<p>George De Mohrenschildt and his wife, both of whom speak Russian
as well as several other languages, however, did continue to see the
Oswalds on occasion up to about the time Oswald went to New Orleans
on April 24, 1963. De Mohrenschildt was apparently the only
Russian-speaking person living in Dallas for whom Oswald had appreciable
respect, and this seems to have been true even though De
Mohrenschildt helped Marina Oswald leave her husband for a
period in November of 1962.<a id="FNanchor_C6-329" href="#Footnote_C6-329" class="fnanchor">C6-329</a></p>

<p>In connection with the relations between Oswald and De Mohrenschildt,
the Commission has considered testimony concerning an event
which occurred shortly after Oswald shot at General Walker. The
De Mohrenschildts came to Oswald’s apartment on Neely Street for
the first time on the evening of April 13, 1963, apparently to bring an
Easter gift for the Oswald child.<a id="FNanchor_C6-330" href="#Footnote_C6-330" class="fnanchor">C6-330</a> Mrs. De Mohrenschildt testified
that while Marina Oswald was showing her the apartment, she
saw a rifle with a scope in a closet. Mrs. De Mohrenschildt then
told her husband, in the presence of the Oswalds, that there was a
rifle in the closet.<a id="FNanchor_C6-331" href="#Footnote_C6-331" class="fnanchor">C6-331</a> Mrs. De Mohrenschildt testified that “George,
of course, with his sense of humor—Walker was shot at a few days ago,
within that time. He said, ‘Did you take a pot shot at Walker by any
chance?’”<a id="FNanchor_C6-332" href="#Footnote_C6-332" class="fnanchor">C6-332</a> At that point, Mr. De Mohrenschildt testified, Oswald
“sort of shriveled, you see, when I asked this question. * * * made
a peculiar face * * * [and] changed the expression on his face” and
remarked that he did targetshooting.<a id="FNanchor_C6-333" href="#Footnote_C6-333" class="fnanchor">C6-333</a> Marina Oswald testified that
the De Mohrenschildts came to visit a few days after the Walker incident
and that when De Mohrenschildt made his reference to Oswald’s
possibly shooting at Walker, Oswald’s “face changed, * * * he almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
became speechless.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-334" href="#Footnote_C6-334" class="fnanchor">C6-334</a> According to the De Mohrenschildts, Mr.
De Mohrenschildt’s remark was intended as a joke, and he had no
knowledge of Oswald’s involvement in the attack on Walker.<a id="FNanchor_C6-335" href="#Footnote_C6-335" class="fnanchor">C6-335</a>
Nonetheless, the remark appears to have created an uncomfortable
silence, and the De Mohrenschildts left “very soon afterwards.” They
never saw either of the Oswalds again.<a id="FNanchor_C6-336" href="#Footnote_C6-336" class="fnanchor">C6-336</a> They left in a few days on
a trip to New York City and did not return until after Oswald had
gone to New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_C6-337" href="#Footnote_C6-337" class="fnanchor">C6-337</a> A postcard from Oswald to De Mohrenschildt
was apparently the only contact they had thereafter.<a id="FNanchor_C6-338" href="#Footnote_C6-338" class="fnanchor">C6-338</a> The
De Mohrenschildts left in early June for Haiti on a business venture,
and they were still residing there at the time they testified on April 23,
1964.<a id="FNanchor_C6-339" href="#Footnote_C6-339" class="fnanchor">C6-339</a></p>

<p>Extensive investigation has been conducted into the background
of both De Mohrenschildts.<a id="FNanchor_C6-340" href="#Footnote_C6-340" class="fnanchor">C6-340</a> The investigation has revealed that
George De Mohrenschildt is a highly individualistic person of varied
interests. He was born in the Russian Ukraine in 1911 and fled Russia
with his parents in 1921 during the civil disorder following the
revolution. He was in a Polish cavalry military academy for 1½ years.
Later he studied in Antwerp and attended the University of Liege
from which he received a doctor’s degree in international commerce
in 1928. Soon thereafter, he emigrated to the United States; he became
a U.S. citizen in 1949.<a id="FNanchor_C6-341" href="#Footnote_C6-341" class="fnanchor">C6-341</a> De Mohrenschildt eventually became
interested in oil exploration and production; he entered the University
of Texas in 1944 and received a master’s degree in petroleum geology
and petroleum engineering in 1945.<a id="FNanchor_C6-342" href="#Footnote_C6-342" class="fnanchor">C6-342</a> He has since become active as a
petroleum engineer throughout the world.<a id="FNanchor_C6-343" href="#Footnote_C6-343" class="fnanchor">C6-343</a> In 1960, after the death
of his son, he and his wife made an 8-month hike from the United
States-Mexican border to Panama over primitive jungle trails. By
happenstance they were in Guatemala City at the time of the Bay of
Pigs invasion.<a id="FNanchor_C6-344" href="#Footnote_C6-344" class="fnanchor">C6-344</a> A lengthy film and complete written log was prepared
by De Mohrenschildt and a report of the trip was made to the
U.S. Government.<a id="FNanchor_C6-345" href="#Footnote_C6-345" class="fnanchor">C6-345</a> Upon arriving in Panama they journeyed to
Haiti where De Mohrenschildt eventually became involved in a Government-oriented
business venture in which he has been engaged continuously
since June 1963 until the time of this report.<a id="FNanchor_C6-346" href="#Footnote_C6-346" class="fnanchor">C6-346</a></p>

<p>The members of the Dallas-Fort Worth Russian community and
others have variously described De Mohrenschildt as eccentric, outspoken,
and a strong believer in individual liberties and in the U.S.
form of government, but also of the belief that some form of undemocratic
government might be best for other peoples.<a id="FNanchor_C6-347" href="#Footnote_C6-347" class="fnanchor">C6-347</a> De Mohrenschildt
frankly admits his provocative personality.<a id="FNanchor_C6-348" href="#Footnote_C6-348" class="fnanchor">C6-348</a></p>

<p>Jeanne De Mohrenschildt was born in Harbin, China, of White
Russian parents. She left during the war with Japan, coming to
New York in 1938 where she became a successful ladies dress and
sportswear apparel designer. She married her present husband in
1959.<a id="FNanchor_C6-349" href="#Footnote_C6-349" class="fnanchor">C6-349</a></p>

<p>The Commission’s investigation has developed no signs of subversive
or disloyal conduct on the part of either of the De Mohrenschildts.
Neither the FBI, CIA, nor any witness contacted by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
Commission has provided any information linking the De Mohrenschildts
to subversive or extremist organizations.<a id="FNanchor_C6-350" href="#Footnote_C6-350" class="fnanchor">C6-350</a> Nor has there
been any evidence linking them in any way with the assassination of
President Kennedy.</p>

<p>The Commission has also considered closely the relations between
the Oswalds and Michael and Ruth Paine of Irving, Tex. The
Paines were not part of the Russian community which has been discussed
above. Ruth Paine speaks Russian, however, and for this
reason was invited to a party in February of 1963 at which she became
acquainted with the Oswalds.<a id="FNanchor_C6-351" href="#Footnote_C6-351" class="fnanchor">C6-351</a> The host had met the Oswalds
through the De Mohrenschildts.<a id="FNanchor_C6-352" href="#Footnote_C6-352" class="fnanchor">C6-352</a> Marina Oswald and Ruth Paine
subsequently became quite friendly, and Mrs. Paine provided considerable
assistance to the Oswalds.<a id="FNanchor_C6-353" href="#Footnote_C6-353" class="fnanchor">C6-353</a> Marina Oswald and her child
resided with Ruth Paine for a little over 2 weeks while Oswald sought
a job in New Orleans in late April and early May 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-354" href="#Footnote_C6-354" class="fnanchor">C6-354</a> In May,
she transported Marina Oswald to New Orleans, paying all of the
traveling and other expenses.<a id="FNanchor_C6-355" href="#Footnote_C6-355" class="fnanchor">C6-355</a> While the Oswalds were in New
Orleans, the two women corresponded.<a id="FNanchor_C6-356" href="#Footnote_C6-356" class="fnanchor">C6-356</a> Mrs. Paine came to New
Orleans in late September and took Marina Oswald and her child
to her home in Irving.<a id="FNanchor_C6-357" href="#Footnote_C6-357" class="fnanchor">C6-357</a></p>

<p>Since Oswald left for Mexico City promptly after Mrs. Paine and
his family departed New Orleans,<a id="FNanchor_C6-358" href="#Footnote_C6-358" class="fnanchor">C6-358</a> the Commission has considered
whether Ruth Paine’s trip to New Orleans was undertaken to assist
Oswald in this venture, but the evidence is clear that it was not. In
her letters to Ruth Paine during the summer of 1963, Marina Oswald
confided that she was having continuing difficulties with her husband,
and Mrs. Paine urged Marina Oswald to live with her in Irving; the
letters of the two women prior to Mrs. Paine’s arrival in New Orleans
on September 20, 1963, however, contain no mention that Oswald was
planning a trip to Mexico City or elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_C6-359" href="#Footnote_C6-359" class="fnanchor">C6-359</a> In New Orleans,
Mrs. Paine was told by Oswald that he planned to seek employment in
Houston, or perhaps Philadelphia. Though Marina Oswald knew
this to be false, she testified that she joined in this deception.<a id="FNanchor_C6-360" href="#Footnote_C6-360" class="fnanchor">C6-360</a> At no
time during the entire weekend was Mexico City mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_C6-361" href="#Footnote_C6-361" class="fnanchor">C6-361</a> Corroboration
for this testimony is found in a letter Mrs. Paine wrote
her mother shortly after she and Marina Oswald had returned to
Irving on September 24, in which she stated that Marina Oswald
was again living with her temporarily and that Oswald was job-hunting.<a id="FNanchor_C6-362" href="#Footnote_C6-362" class="fnanchor">C6-362</a>
When Oswald arrived at the Paine home on October 4,
he continued his deception by telling Mrs. Paine, in his wife’s presence,
that he had been unsuccessful in finding employment.<a id="FNanchor_C6-363" href="#Footnote_C6-363" class="fnanchor">C6-363</a> At Oswald’s
request, Marina Oswald remained silent.<a id="FNanchor_C6-364" href="#Footnote_C6-364" class="fnanchor">C6-364</a></p>

<p>Marina Oswald lived with Ruth Paine through the birth of her
second daughter on October 20, 1963, and until the assassination of
President Kennedy.<a id="FNanchor_C6-365" href="#Footnote_C6-365" class="fnanchor">C6-365</a> During this period, Oswald obtained a room
in Dallas and found employment in Dallas, but spent weekends with
his family at the Paine home.<a id="FNanchor_C6-366" href="#Footnote_C6-366" class="fnanchor">C6-366</a> On November 1 and 5, Ruth Paine
was interviewed by agents of the FBI who were investigating Oswald’s
activities since his return from the Soviet Union, as set forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
in greater detail in chapter VIII. She did not then know Oswald’s
address in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-367" href="#Footnote_C6-367" class="fnanchor">C6-367</a> She was not asked for, nor did she volunteer,
Oswald’s telephone number in Dallas, which she did know.<a id="FNanchor_C6-368" href="#Footnote_C6-368" class="fnanchor">C6-368</a> She
advised the Bureau agent to whom she spoke of Oswald’s periodic
weekend visits, and she informed him that Oswald was employed at
the Texas School Book Depository Building.<a id="FNanchor_C6-369" href="#Footnote_C6-369" class="fnanchor">C6-369</a></p>

<p>On November 10, Ruth Paine discovered a draft of Oswald’s letter
written the day before to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, in
which he indicated that he had journeyed to Mexico City and conferred
with a “comrade Kostine in the Embassy of the Soviet Union,
Mexico City, Mexico.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-370" href="#Footnote_C6-370" class="fnanchor">C6-370</a> (This letter is discussed later in this
chapter.) Mr. and Mrs. Paine testified that although they initially
assumed the letter was a figment of Oswald’s imagination, the letter
gave Mrs. Paine considerable misgivings.<a id="FNanchor_C6-371" href="#Footnote_C6-371" class="fnanchor">C6-371</a> She determined that if
the FBI agents returned she would deliver to them the copy of a draft
of the letter which, unknown to Oswald, she had made.<a id="FNanchor_C6-372" href="#Footnote_C6-372" class="fnanchor">C6-372</a> However,
the agents did not return before the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-373" href="#Footnote_C6-373" class="fnanchor">C6-373</a> On November
19, Mrs. Paine learned that Oswald was living in his Dallas rooming-house
under an assumed name.<a id="FNanchor_C6-374" href="#Footnote_C6-374" class="fnanchor">C6-374</a> She did not report this to the
FBI because, as she testified, she “had no occasion to see them, and
* * * did not think it important enough to call them after that until
the 23d of November.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-375" href="#Footnote_C6-375" class="fnanchor">C6-375</a></p>

<p>The Commission has thoroughly investigated the background of
both Paines. Mrs. Paine was born Ruth Hyde in New York City on
September 3, 1932. Her parents moved to Columbus, Ohio, in the
late 1930’s.<a id="FNanchor_C6-376" href="#Footnote_C6-376" class="fnanchor">C6-376</a> They were divorced in 1961.<a id="FNanchor_C6-377" href="#Footnote_C6-377" class="fnanchor">C6-377</a> Ruth Paine graduated
from Antioch College in 1955.<a id="FNanchor_C6-378" href="#Footnote_C6-378" class="fnanchor">C6-378</a> While in high school she first
became interested in Quaker activities; she and her brother became
Quakers in 1951.<a id="FNanchor_C6-379" href="#Footnote_C6-379" class="fnanchor">C6-379</a> In 1952, following completion of her sophomore
year at Antioch College, she was a delegate to two Friends conferences
in England.<a id="FNanchor_C6-380" href="#Footnote_C6-380" class="fnanchor">C6-380</a></p>

<p>At the time the Paines met in 1955, Mrs. Paine was active in the
work of the Young Friends Committee of North America, which, with
the cooperation of the Department of State, was making an effort to
lessen the tensions between Soviet Russia and the United States by
means of the stimulation of contacts and exchange of cultures between
citizens of the two nations through “pen-pal” correspondence and
exchanges of young Russians and Americans.<a id="FNanchor_C6-381" href="#Footnote_C6-381" class="fnanchor">C6-381</a> It was during
this period that Mrs. Paine became interested in the Russian language.<a id="FNanchor_C6-382" href="#Footnote_C6-382" class="fnanchor">C6-382</a>
Mrs. Paine participated in a Russian-American student exchange
program sponsored by the Young Friends Committee of North
America, and has participated in the “pen-pal” phase of the activities
of the Young Friends Committee.<a id="FNanchor_C6-383" href="#Footnote_C6-383" class="fnanchor">C6-383</a> She has corresponded until
recently with a schoolteacher in Russia.<a id="FNanchor_C6-384" href="#Footnote_C6-384" class="fnanchor">C6-384</a> Although her active interest
in the Friends’ program for the lessening of East-West tensions
ceased upon her marriage in December 1957, she has continued to hold
to the tenets of the Quaker faith.<a id="FNanchor_C6-385" href="#Footnote_C6-385" class="fnanchor">C6-385</a></p>

<p>Michael Paine is the son of George Lyman Paine and Ruth Forbes
Paine, now Ruth Forbes Young, wife of Arthur Young of Philadelphia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
Pa.<a id="FNanchor_C6-386" href="#Footnote_C6-386" class="fnanchor">C6-386</a> His parents were divorced when he was 4 years of
age. His father, George Lyman Paine, is an architect and resides in
California.<a id="FNanchor_C6-387" href="#Footnote_C6-387" class="fnanchor">C6-387</a> Michael Paine testified that during his late grammar
and early high school days his father participated actively in the
Trotskyite faction of the Communist movement in the United States
and that he attended some of those meetings.<a id="FNanchor_C6-388" href="#Footnote_C6-388" class="fnanchor">C6-388</a> He stated that his
father, with whom he has had little contact throughout most of his
life, has not influenced his political thinking. He said that he has
visited his father four or five times in California since 1959, but their
discussions did not include the subject of communism.<a id="FNanchor_C6-389" href="#Footnote_C6-389" class="fnanchor">C6-389</a> Since moving
to Irving, Tex., in 1959, he has been a research engineer for Bell
Helicopter Co. in Fort Worth.<a id="FNanchor_C6-390" href="#Footnote_C6-390" class="fnanchor">C6-390</a> Mr. Paine has security clearance for
his work.<a id="FNanchor_C6-391" href="#Footnote_C6-391" class="fnanchor">C6-391</a> He has been a long-time member of the American Civil
Liberties Union.<a id="FNanchor_C6-392" href="#Footnote_C6-392" class="fnanchor">C6-392</a> Though not in sympathy with rightist political
aims, he has attended a few meetings of far-right organizations in
Dallas for the purpose, he testified, of learning something about those
organizations and because he “was interested in seeing more communication
between the right and the left.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-393" href="#Footnote_C6-393" class="fnanchor">C6-393</a></p>

<p>The Commission has conducted a thorough investigation of the
Paines’ finances and is satisfied that their income has been from legitimate
and traceable sources, and that their expenditures were consistent
with their income and for normal purposes. Although in the course of
their relationship with the Oswalds, the Paines assumed expenses for
such matters as food and transportation, with a value of approximately
$500, they made no direct payments to, and received no moneys
or valuables from, the Oswalds.<a id="FNanchor_C6-394" href="#Footnote_C6-394" class="fnanchor">C6-394</a></p>

<p>Although prior to November 22, Mrs. Paine had information relating
to Oswald’s use of an alias in Dallas, his telephone number, and his
correspondence with the Soviet Embassy, which she did not pass on to
the FBI,<a id="FNanchor_C6-395" href="#Footnote_C6-395" class="fnanchor">C6-395</a> her failure to have come forward with this information
must be viewed within the context of the information available to
her at that time. There is no evidence to contradict her testimony
that she did not then know about Oswald’s attack on General Walker,
the presence of the rifle on the floor of her garage, Oswald’s ownership
of a pistol, or the photographs of Oswald displaying the firearms.<a id="FNanchor_C6-396" href="#Footnote_C6-396" class="fnanchor">C6-396</a>
She thus assumed that Oswald, though a difficult and disturbing
personality, was not potentially violent, and that the FBI was
cognizant of his past history and current activities.<a id="FNanchor_C6-397" href="#Footnote_C6-397" class="fnanchor">C6-397</a></p>

<p>Moreover, it is from Mrs. Paine herself that the Commission has
learned that she possessed the information which she did have. Mrs.
Paine was forthright with the agent of the FBI with whom she spoke
in early November 1963, providing him with sufficient information to
have located Oswald at his job if he had deemed it necessary to do
so,<a id="FNanchor_C6-398" href="#Footnote_C6-398" class="fnanchor">C6-398</a> and her failure to have taken immediate steps to notify the
Bureau of the additional information does not under the circumstances
appear unusual. Throughout the Commission’s investigation,
Ruth Paine has been completely cooperative, voluntarily producing
all correspondence, memoranda, and other written communications in
her possession that had passed between her and Marina Oswald both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
before and after November 22, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-399" href="#Footnote_C6-399" class="fnanchor">C6-399</a> The Commission has had the
benefit of Mrs. Paine’s 1963 date book and calendar and her address
book and telephone notation book, in both of which appear many entries
relating to her activities with the Oswalds.<a id="FNanchor_C6-400" href="#Footnote_C6-400" class="fnanchor">C6-400</a> Other material of
a purely personal nature was also voluntarily made available.<a id="FNanchor_C6-401" href="#Footnote_C6-401" class="fnanchor">C6-401</a> The
Commission has found nothing in the Paines’ background, activities,
or finances which suggests disloyalty to the United States,<a id="FNanchor_C6-402" href="#Footnote_C6-402" class="fnanchor">C6-402</a> and it
has concluded that Ruth and Michael Paine were not involved in any
way with the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>A fuller narrative of the social contacts between the Oswalds
and the various persons of the Dallas-Fort Worth community is
incorporated in chapter VII and appendix XIII, and the testimony
of all members of the group who testified before the Commission is
included in the printed record which accompanies the report. The
evidence establishes that the Oswalds’ contacts with these people were
originated and maintained under normal and understandable circumstances.
The files maintained by the FBI contain no information
indicating that any of the persons in the Dallas-Fort Worth community
with whom Oswald associated were affiliated with any Communist,
Fascist, or other subversive organization.<a id="FNanchor_C6-403" href="#Footnote_C6-403" class="fnanchor">C6-403</a> During the course
of this investigation, the Commission has found nothing which suggests
the involvement of any member of the Russian-speaking community
in Oswald’s preparations to assassinate President Kennedy.</p>

<h4 id="hdr129">Political Activities Upon Return to the United States</h4>

<p>Upon his return from the Soviet Union, Oswald had dealings with
the Communist Party, U.S.A., the Socialist Workers Party, and the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and he also had minor contacts with
at least two other organizations with political interests. For the purpose
of determining whether Oswald received any advice, encouragement,
or assistance from these organizations in planning or executing
the assassination of President Kennedy, the Commission has conducted
a full investigation of the nature and extent of Oswald’s relations
with them. The Commission has also conducted an investigation
to determine whether certain persons and organizations expressing
hostility to President Kennedy prior to the assassination had any connection
with Lee Harvey Oswald or with the shooting of the President.</p>

<p><i>Communist Party, U.S.A.; Socialist Workers Party.</i>—In August of
1962, Oswald subscribed to the Worker, a publication of the Communist
Party, U.S.A.<a id="FNanchor_C6-404" href="#Footnote_C6-404" class="fnanchor">C6-404</a> He also wrote the Communist Party to obtain
pamphlets and other literature which, the evidence indicates, were
sent to him as a matter of course.<a id="FNanchor_C6-405" href="#Footnote_C6-405" class="fnanchor">C6-405</a></p>

<p>Oswald also attempted to initiate other dealings with the Communist
Party, U.S.A., but the organization was not especially responsive.
From New Orleans, he informed the party of his activities in connection
with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, discussed below, submitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
membership cards in his fictitious chapter to several party
officials.<a id="FNanchor_C6-406" href="#Footnote_C6-406" class="fnanchor">C6-406</a> In a letter from Arnold S. Johnson, director of the information
and lecture bureau of the party, Oswald was informed that although
the Communist Party had no “organizational ties” with the
committee, the party issued much literature which was “important
for anybody who is concerned about developments in Cuba.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-407" href="#Footnote_C6-407" class="fnanchor">C6-407</a> In
September 1963 Oswald inquired how he might contact the party
when he relocated in the Baltimore-Washington area, as he said he
planned to do in October, and Johnson suggested in a letter of September
19 that he “get in touch with us here [New York] and we will
find some way of getting in touch with you in that city [Baltimore].”<a id="FNanchor_C6-408" href="#Footnote_C6-408" class="fnanchor">C6-408</a>
However, Oswald had also written asking whether, “handicapped
as it were, by * * * [his] past record,” he could “still * * *
compete with antiprogressive forces, above ground or whether in your
opinion * * * [he] should always remain in the background, i.e.,
underground,” and in the September 19 letter received the reply that
“often it is advisable for some people to remain in the background,
not underground.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-409" href="#Footnote_C6-409" class="fnanchor">C6-409</a></p>

<p>In a letter postmarked November 1, Oswald informed the party that
he had moved to Dallas, and reported his attendance at a meeting at
which General Walker had spoken, and at a meeting of the American
Civil Liberties Union; he asked Johnson for the party’s “general
view” of the latter organization and “to what degree, if any, [he]
should attempt to highten its progressive tendencies.” According to
Johnson, this letter was not received by the Communist Party until
after the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-410" href="#Footnote_C6-410" class="fnanchor">C6-410</a> At different times, Oswald also wrote the
Worker and the Hall-Davis Defense Committee, enclosing samples of
his photographic work and offering to assist in preparing posters; he
was told that “his kind offer [was] most welcomed and from time to
time we shall call on you,” but he was never asked for assistance.<a id="FNanchor_C6-411" href="#Footnote_C6-411" class="fnanchor">C6-411</a>
The correspondence between Oswald and the Communist Party, and
with all other organizations, is printed in the record accompanying
this report.</p>

<p>When Oswald applied for a visa to enter Cuba during his trip to
Mexico City, discussed below,<a id="FNanchor_C6-412" href="#Footnote_C6-412" class="fnanchor">C6-412</a> Senora Silvia Duran, the Cuban
consular employee who dealt with Oswald, wrote on the application
that Oswald said he was a member of the Communist Party and
that he had “displayed documents in proof of his membership.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-413" href="#Footnote_C6-413" class="fnanchor">C6-413</a>
When Oswald went to Mexico, he is believed to have carried
his letters from the Soviet Embassy in Washington and from
the Communist Party in the United States, his 1959 passport,
which contained stamps showing that he had lived in Russia for 2½
years, his Russian work permit, his Russian marriage certificate, membership
cards and newspaper clippings purporting to show his role
in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and a prepared statement of
his qualifications as a “Marxist.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-414" href="#Footnote_C6-414" class="fnanchor">C6-414</a> Because of the mass of papers
Oswald did present showing his affinity for communism, some in the
Russian language, which was foreign to Senora Duran, and because
further investigation, discussed below, indicated that Oswald was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
a member of the party, Senora Duran’s notation was probably
inaccurate.</p>

<p>Upon his arrest after the assassination, Oswald attempted to
contact John J. Abt, a New York attorney, to request Abt to represent
him. Abt was not in New York at the time, and he was
never reached in connection with representing Oswald. Abt has
testified that he at no time had any dealings with Oswald and that
prior to the assassination he had never heard of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-415" href="#Footnote_C6-415" class="fnanchor">C6-415</a></p>

<p>After his return from the Soviet Union, Oswald also carried on a
limited correspondence with the Socialist Workers Party. In October
of 1962 he attempted to join the party, but his application
was not accepted since there was then no chapter in the Dallas area.<a id="FNanchor_C6-416" href="#Footnote_C6-416" class="fnanchor">C6-416</a>
Oswald also wrote the Socialist Workers Party offering his assistance
in preparing posters. From this organization too he received the
response that he might be called upon if needed. He was asked for
further information about his photographic skills, which he does not
appear to have ever provided.<a id="FNanchor_C6-417" href="#Footnote_C6-417" class="fnanchor">C6-417</a> Oswald did obtain literature from
the Socialist Workers Party, however, and in December 1962 he entered
a subscription to the affiliated publication, the Militant.<a id="FNanchor_C6-418" href="#Footnote_C6-418" class="fnanchor">C6-418</a> Apparently
in March of 1963 Oswald wrote the party of his activities and
submitted a clipping with his letter. In response, he was told that
his name was being sent to the Young Socialist Alliance for further
correspondence, but the files of the alliance apparently contain no
reference to Oswald. Neither the letter nor the clipping which Oswald
sent has been located.<a id="FNanchor_C6-419" href="#Footnote_C6-419" class="fnanchor">C6-419</a></p>

<p>Investigation by the Commission has produced no plausible evidence
that Lee Harvey Oswald had any other significant contacts with the
Communist Party, U.S.A., the Socialist Workers Party, or with any
other extreme leftist political organization. The FBI and other
Federal security agencies have made a study of their records and
files and contacted numerous confidential informants of the
agencies and have produced no such evidence.<a id="FNanchor_C6-420" href="#Footnote_C6-420" class="fnanchor">C6-420</a> The Commission
has questioned persons who, as a group, knew Oswald during virtually
every phase of his adult life, and from none of these came any indication
that Oswald maintained a surreptitious relationship with any
organization. Arnold S. Johnson, of the American Communist Party;
James T. Tormey, executive secretary of the Hall-Davis Defense
Committee; and Farrell Dobbs, secretary of the Socialist Workers
Party, voluntarily appeared before the Commission and testified under
oath that Oswald was not a member of these organizations and that a
thorough search of their files had disclosed no records relating to
Oswald other than those which they produced for the Commission.<a id="FNanchor_C6-421" href="#Footnote_C6-421" class="fnanchor">C6-421</a>
The material that has been disclosed is in all cases consistent with
other data in the possession of the Commission.</p>

<p><i>Socialist Labor Party.</i>—Oswald also wrote to the Socialist Labor
Party in New York in November 1962 requesting literature. Horace
Twiford, a national committeeman at large for the party in the State
of Texas, was informed by the New York headquarters in July 1963<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
of Oswald’s request, and on September 11, 1963, he did mail literature
to Oswald at his old post office box in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-422" href="#Footnote_C6-422" class="fnanchor">C6-422</a> On his way to Mexico
City in September 1963, Oswald attempted to contact Twiford at his
home in Houston; Oswald spoke briefly with Twiford’s wife, identifying
himself as a member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, but
since Twiford was out of town at the time, Oswald was unable to speak
with him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-423" href="#Footnote_C6-423" class="fnanchor">C6-423</a> Arnold Peterson, national secretary and treasurer of the
Socialist Labor Party, has stated that a search of the records of the
national headquarters reveals no record pertaining to Oswald; he explained
that letters requesting literature are routinely destroyed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-424" href="#Footnote_C6-424" class="fnanchor">C6-424</a>
The Socialist Party-Social Democratic Federation has also advised
that a review of its records fails to reflect any information or correspondence
pertaining to Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-425" href="#Footnote_C6-425" class="fnanchor">C6-425</a></p>

<p><i>Fair Play for Cuba Committee.</i>—During the period Oswald was
in New Orleans, from the end of April to late September 1963, he was
engaged in activity purportedly on behalf of the now defunct Fair
Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC), an organization centered in New
York which was highly critical of U.S. policy toward the Cuban
Government under Fidel Castro. In May 1963, after having obtained
literature from the FPCC,<a id="FNanchor_C6-426" href="#Footnote_C6-426" class="fnanchor">C6-426</a> Oswald applied for and was granted
membership in the organization.<a id="FNanchor_C6-427" href="#Footnote_C6-427" class="fnanchor">C6-427</a> When applying for membership,
Oswald wrote national headquarters that he had</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * been thinking about renting a small office at my own expense
for the purpose of forming a F.P.C.C. branch here in New
Orleans.</p>

<p>Could you give me a charter?<a id="FNanchor_C6-428" href="#Footnote_C6-428" class="fnanchor">C6-428</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">With his membership card, Oswald apparently received a copy of the
constitution and bylaws for FPCC chapters, and a letter, dated May
29, which read in part as follows (with spelling as in original):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It would be hard to concieve of a chapter with as few
members as seem to exist in the New Orleans area. I have just
gone through our files and find that Louisiana seams somewhat
restricted for Fair Play activities. However, with what is there
perhaps you could build a larger group if a few people would
undertake the disciplined responsibility of concrete organizational
work.</p>

<p>We certainly are not at all adverse to a very small Chapter but
certainly would expect that there would be at least twice the
amount needed to conduct a legal executive board for the Chapter.
Should this be reasonable we could readily issue a charter
for a New Orleans Chapter of FPCC. In fact, we would be
very, very pleased to see this take place and would like to do
everything possible to assist in bringing it about.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
You must realize that you will come under tremendous pressures
with any attempt to do FPCC work in that area and that
you will not be able to operate in the manner which is conventional
here in the north-east. Even most of our big city Chapters
have been forced to Abandon the idea of operating an office
in public. * * * Most Chapters have discovered that it is easier
to operate semi-privately out of a home and maintain a P.O.
Box for all mailings and public notices. (A P.O. Box is a must
for any Chapter in the organization to guarnatee the continued
contact with the national even if an individual should
move or drop out.) We do have a serious and often violent opposition
and this proceedure helps prevent many unnecessary incidents
which frighten away prospective supporters. I definitely would
not recommend an office, at least not one that will be easily identifyable
to the lunatic fringe in your community. Certainly,
I would not recommend that you engage in one at the very beginning
but wait and see how you can operate in the community
through several public experiences.<a id="FNanchor_C6-429" href="#Footnote_C6-429" class="fnanchor">C6-429</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Thereafter Oswald informed national headquarters that he had opened
post office box No. 30061, and that against its advice he had decided “to
take an office from the very beginning”; he also submitted copies
of a membership application form and a circular headed “Hands Off
Cuba!” which he had had printed, and informed the headquarters
that he intended to have membership cards for his chapter printed,
which he subsequently did.<a id="FNanchor_C6-430" href="#Footnote_C6-430" class="fnanchor">C6-430</a> He wrote three further letters to the
New York office to inform it of his continued activities.<a id="FNanchor_C6-431" href="#Footnote_C6-431" class="fnanchor">C6-431</a> In one he
reported that he had been evicted from the office he claimed to have
opened, so that he “worked out of a post office box and by useing street
demonstrations and some circular work * * * sustained a great deal of
interest but no new members.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-432" href="#Footnote_C6-432" class="fnanchor">C6-432</a></p>

<p>Oswald did distribute the handbills he had printed on at least three
occasions.<a id="FNanchor_C6-433" href="#Footnote_C6-433" class="fnanchor">C6-433</a> Once, while doing so, he was arrested and fined for
being involved in a disturbance with anti-Castro Cuban refugees,<a id="FNanchor_C6-434" href="#Footnote_C6-434" class="fnanchor">C6-434</a>
one of whom he had previously met by presenting himself as hostile to
Premier Castro in an apparent effort to gain information about anti-Castro
organizations operating in New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_C6-435" href="#Footnote_C6-435" class="fnanchor">C6-435</a> When arrested, he
informed the police that his chapter had 35 members.<a id="FNanchor_C6-436" href="#Footnote_C6-436" class="fnanchor">C6-436</a> His activities
received some attention in the New Orleans press, and he twice appeared
on a local radio program representing himself as a spokesman
for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.<a id="FNanchor_C6-437" href="#Footnote_C6-437" class="fnanchor">C6-437</a> After his return to Dallas,
he listed the FPCC as an organization authorized to receive mail at
his post office box.<a id="FNanchor_C6-438" href="#Footnote_C6-438" class="fnanchor">C6-438</a></p>

<p>Despite these activities, the FPCC chapter which Oswald purportedly
formed in New Orleans was entirely fictitious. Vincent T.
Lee, formerly national director of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee,
has testified that the New York office did not authorize the creation
of a New Orleans chapter, nor did it provide Oswald with funds
to support his activities there.<a id="FNanchor_C6-439" href="#Footnote_C6-439" class="fnanchor">C6-439</a> The national office did not write<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
Oswald again after its letter of May 29. As discussed more fully in
chapter VII, Oswald’s later letters to the national office purporting to
inform it of his progress in New Orleans contained numerous exaggerations
about the scope of his activities and the public reaction to
them.<a id="FNanchor_C6-440" href="#Footnote_C6-440" class="fnanchor">C6-440</a> There is no evidence that Oswald ever opened an office as he
claimed to have done. Although a pamphlet taken from him at the
time of his arrest in New Orleans contains the rubber stamp imprint
“FPCC, 544 CAMP ST., NEW ORLEANS, LA.,” investigation has
indicated that neither the Fair Play for Cuba Committee nor Lee Harvey
Oswald ever maintained an office at that address.<a id="FNanchor_C6-441" href="#Footnote_C6-441" class="fnanchor">C6-441</a> The handbills
and other materials bearing the name of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee
were printed commercially by Oswald without the approval of
the national headquarters.<a id="FNanchor_C6-442" href="#Footnote_C6-442" class="fnanchor">C6-442</a> Oswald’s membership card in the “New
Orleans chapter” of the committee carried the signature of “A. J.
Hidell,” purportedly the president of the chapter, but there is no
evidence that an “A. J. Hidell” existed and, as pointed out in chapter
IV, there is conclusive evidence that the name was an alias which
Oswald used on various occasions. Marina Oswald herself wrote the
name “Hidell” on the membership card at her husband’s insistence.<a id="FNanchor_C6-443" href="#Footnote_C6-443" class="fnanchor">C6-443</a></p>

<p>No other member of the so-called New Orleans chapter of the committee
has ever been found. The only occasion on which anyone other
than Oswald was observed taking part in these activities was on
August 9, 1963, when Oswald and two young men passed out leaflets
urging “Hands Off Cuba!” on the streets of New Orleans. One of
the two men, who was 16 years old at the time, has testified that Oswald
approached him at the Louisiana State Employment Commission and
offered him $2 for about an hour’s work. He accepted the offer but
later, when he noticed that television cameras were being focused on
him, he obtained his money and left. He testified that he had never
seen Oswald before and never saw him again. The second individual
has never been located; but according to the testimony of the youth
who was found, he too seemed to be someone not previously connected
with Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-444" href="#Footnote_C6-444" class="fnanchor">C6-444</a> Finally, the FBI has advised the Commission that its
information on undercover Cuban activities in the New Orleans area
reveals no knowledge of Oswald before the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-445" href="#Footnote_C6-445" class="fnanchor">C6-445</a></p>

<p><i>Right-wing groups hostile to President Kennedy.</i>—The Commission
also considered the possibility that there may have been
a link between Oswald and certain groups which had bitterly denounced
President Kennedy and his policies prior to the time of the
President’s trip to Dallas. As discussed in chapter II, two provocative
incidents took place concurrently with President Kennedy’s visit
and a third but a month prior thereto. The incidents were (1) the
demonstration against the Honorable Adlai E. Stevenson, U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations, in late October 1963, when he came
to Dallas on United Nations Day; (2) the publication in the Dallas
Morning News on November 22 of the full page, black-bordered paid
advertisement entitled, “Welcome Mr. Kennedy”; and (3) the distribution
of a throwaway handbill entitled “Wanted for Treason”
throughout Dallas on November 20 and 21. Oswald was aware of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
the Stevenson incident; there is no evidence that he became aware of
either the “Welcome Mr. Kennedy” advertisement or the “Wanted
for Treason” handbill, though neither possibility can be precluded.</p>

<p>The only evidence of interest on Oswald’s part in rightist groups
in Dallas was his alleged attendance at a rally at the Dallas Auditorium
the evening preceding Ambassador Stevenson’s address on
United Nations Day, October 24, 1963. On the evening of October 25,
1963, at the invitation of Michael Paine, Oswald attended a monthly
meeting of the Dallas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union
in which he was later to seek membership.<a id="FNanchor_C6-446" href="#Footnote_C6-446" class="fnanchor">C6-446</a> During the course of
the discussion at this meeting, a speaker mentioned Maj. Gen. Edwin
A. Walker (Resigned, U.S. Army). Oswald arose in the midst of the
meeting to remark that a “night or two nights before” he had attended
a meeting at which General Walker had spoken in terms that led
Oswald to assert that General Walker was both anti-Catholic and
anti-Semitic.<a id="FNanchor_C6-447" href="#Footnote_C6-447" class="fnanchor">C6-447</a> General Walker testified that he had been the speaker
at a rally the night before Ambassador Stevenson’s appearance, but
that he did not know and had never heard of Oswald prior to the
announcement of his name on radio and television on the afternoon of
November 22.<a id="FNanchor_C6-448" href="#Footnote_C6-448" class="fnanchor">C6-448</a> Oswald confirmed his attendance at the U.S. Day
rally in an undated letter he wrote to Arnold Johnson, director of the
information and lecture bureau of the Communist Party, mailed
November 1, 1963, in which he reported:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On October 23rd, I had attended a ultra-right meeting headed
by General Edwin a. Walker, who lives in Dallas.</p>

<p>This meeting preceded by one day the attack on a. e. Stevenson
at the United Nations Day meeting at which he spoke.</p>

<p>As you can see, political friction between ‘left’ and ‘right’ is
very great here.<a id="FNanchor_C6-449" href="#Footnote_C6-449" class="fnanchor">C6-449</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the light of Oswald’s attack upon General Walker on the evening
of April 10, 1963, discussed in chapter IV,<a id="FNanchor_C6-450" href="#Footnote_C6-450" class="fnanchor">C6-450</a> as well as Oswald’s known
political views,<a id="FNanchor_C6-451" href="#Footnote_C6-451" class="fnanchor">C6-451</a> his asserted attendance at the political rally at which
General Walker spoke may have been induced by many possible
motives. However, there is no evidence that Oswald attended any
other rightist meetings or was associated with any politically conservative
organizations.</p>

<p>While the black-bordered “Welcome Mr. Kennedy” advertisement
in the November 22 Dallas Morning News, which addressed a series
of critical questions to the President, probably did not come to
Oswald’s attention, it was of interest to the Commission because of
its appearance on the day of the assassination and because of an allegation
made before the Commission concerning the person whose
name appeared as the chairman of the committee sponsoring the advertisement.
The black-bordered advertisement was purported to be
sponsored by “The American Fact-Finding Committee,” which was
described as “An unaffiliated and nonpartisan group of citizens who
wish truth.” Bernard Weissman was listed as “Chairman” and a
post office box in Dallas was the only address. (See Commission
Exhibit No. 1031, <a href="#Page_294">p. 294</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span></p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Commission Exhibit No. 1031</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
The Commission has conducted a full investigation into the genesis
of this advertisement and the background of those responsible for it.
Three of the four men chiefly responsible, Bernard W. Weissman, William
B. Burley III, and Larrie H. Schmidt, had served together in
the U.S. Army in Munich, Germany, in 1962. During that time
they had with others devised plans to develop two conservative organizations,
one political and the other business. The political
entity was to be named Conservatism—USA, or CUSA, and the business
entity was to be named American Business, or AMBUS.<a id="FNanchor_C6-452" href="#Footnote_C6-452" class="fnanchor">C6-452</a> While
in Munich, according to Weissman, they attempted to develop in their
“own minds * * * ways to build up various businesses that would support
us and at the same time support our political activities.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-453" href="#Footnote_C6-453" class="fnanchor">C6-453</a> According
to a subsequent letter from Schmidt to Weissman, “Cusa was
founded for patriotic reasons rather than for personal gain—even
though, as a side effect, Ambus was to have brought great return, as
any business endeavor should.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-454" href="#Footnote_C6-454" class="fnanchor">C6-454</a> To establish their organizations,
Weissman testified that they:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * had planned while in Munich that in order to accomplish
our goals, to try to do it from scratch would be almost impossible,
because it would be years before we could even get the funds
to develop a powerful organization. So we had planned to
infiltrate various rightwing organizations and by our own efforts
become involved in the hierarchy of these various organizations
and eventually get ourselves elected or appointed to various
higher offices in these organizations, and by doing this bring in
some of our own people, and eventually take over the leadership
of these organizations, and at that time having our people in
these various organizations, we would then, you might say, call
a conference and have them unite, and while no one knew of the
existence of CUSA aside from us, we would then bring them all
together, unite them, and arrange to have it called CUSA.<a id="FNanchor_C6-455" href="#Footnote_C6-455" class="fnanchor">C6-455</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Schmidt was the first to leave the service; settling in Dallas in
October 1962, he became a life insurance salesman and quickly engaged
in numerous political activities in pursuit of the objectives devised in
Munich.<a id="FNanchor_C6-456" href="#Footnote_C6-456" class="fnanchor">C6-456</a> He became affiliated with several organizations and prepared
various political writings.<a id="FNanchor_C6-457" href="#Footnote_C6-457" class="fnanchor">C6-457</a></p>

<p>Upon their release from the military, Weissman and Burley did not
immediately move to Dallas, though repeatedly urged to do so by
Schmidt.<a id="FNanchor_C6-458" href="#Footnote_C6-458" class="fnanchor">C6-458</a> On October 1, 1963, Schmidt wrote Weissman: “Adlai
Stevenson is scheduled here on the 24th on UN Day. Kennedy is
scheduled in Dallas on Nov. 24th. There are to be protests. All the
big things are happening <em>now</em>—if we don’t get in right now we may
as well forget it.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-459" href="#Footnote_C6-459" class="fnanchor">C6-459</a> The day of the Stevenson demonstration,
Schmidt telephoned Weissman, again urging him to move to Dallas.
Recalling that conversation with Schmidt, Weissman testified:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>And he said, “If we are going to take advantage of the situation
* * * you better hurry down here and take advantage of the
publicity, and at least become known among these various right-wingers,
because this is the chance we have been looking for to
infiltrate some of these organizations and become known,” in other
words, go along with the philosophy we had developed in
Munich.<a id="FNanchor_C6-460" href="#Footnote_C6-460" class="fnanchor">C6-460</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Five days later he wrote to Weissman and Burley to report that as
the “only organizer of the demonstration to have publicly identified
himself,” he had “become, overnight, a ‘fearless spokesman’ and ‘leader’
of the rightwing in Dallas. What I worked so hard for in one year—and
nearly failed—finally came through one incident in one night!”
He ended, “Politically, CUSA is set. It is now up to you to get
Ambus going.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-461" href="#Footnote_C6-461" class="fnanchor">C6-461</a></p>

<p>Weissman and Burley accepted Schmidt’s prompting and traveled
to Dallas, arriving on November 4, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-462" href="#Footnote_C6-462" class="fnanchor">C6-462</a> Both obtained employment
as carpet salesmen. At Schmidt’s solicitation they took steps to
join the John Birch Society, and through Schmidt they met the fourth
person involved in placing the November 22 advertisement, Joseph P.
Grinnan, Dallas independent oil operator and a John Birch Society
coordinator in the Dallas area.<a id="FNanchor_C6-463" href="#Footnote_C6-463" class="fnanchor">C6-463</a></p>

<p>Within a week to 10 days after Weissman and Burley had arrived in
Dallas, the four men began to consider plans regarding President
Kennedy’s planned visit to Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-464" href="#Footnote_C6-464" class="fnanchor">C6-464</a> Weissman explained the reason
for which it was decided that the ad should be placed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * after the Stevenson incident, it was felt that a demonstration
would be entirely out of order, because we didn’t want anything
to happen in the way of physical violence to President
Kennedy when he came to Dallas. But we thought that the conservatives
in Dallas—I was told—were a pretty downtrodden lot
after that, because they were being oppressed by the local liberals,
because of the Stevenson incident. We felt we had to do something
to build up the morale of the conservative element, in
Dallas. So we hit upon the idea of the ad.<a id="FNanchor_C6-465" href="#Footnote_C6-465" class="fnanchor">C6-465</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Weissman, Schmidt, and Grinnan worked on the text for the advertisement.<a id="FNanchor_C6-466" href="#Footnote_C6-466" class="fnanchor">C6-466</a>
A pamphlet containing 50 questions critical of American
policy was employed for this purpose, and was the source of the militant
questions contained in the ad attacking President Kennedy’s
administration.<a id="FNanchor_C6-467" href="#Footnote_C6-467" class="fnanchor">C6-467</a> Grinnan undertook to raise the $1,465 needed to
pay for the ad.<a id="FNanchor_C6-468" href="#Footnote_C6-468" class="fnanchor">C6-468</a> He employed a typed draft of the advertisement
to support his funds solicitation.<a id="FNanchor_C6-469" href="#Footnote_C6-469" class="fnanchor">C6-469</a> Grinnan raised the needed money
from three wealthy Dallas businessmen: Edgar R. Crissey, Nelson
Bunker Hunt, and H. R. Bright, some of whom in turn collected
contributions from others.<a id="FNanchor_C6-470" href="#Footnote_C6-470" class="fnanchor">C6-470</a> At least one of the contributors would
not make a contribution unless a question he suggested was inserted.<a id="FNanchor_C6-471" href="#Footnote_C6-471" class="fnanchor">C6-471</a>
Weissman, believing that Schmidt, Grinnan, and the contributors were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
active members of the John Birch Society, and that Grinnan eventually
took charge of the project, expressed the opinion that the advertisement
was the creation of the John Birch Society,<a id="FNanchor_C6-472" href="#Footnote_C6-472" class="fnanchor">C6-472</a> though
Schmidt and Grinnan have maintained that they were acting “solely
as individuals.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-473" href="#Footnote_C6-473" class="fnanchor">C6-473</a></p>

<p>A fictitious sponsoring organization was invented out of whole
cloth.<a id="FNanchor_C6-474" href="#Footnote_C6-474" class="fnanchor">C6-474</a> The name chosen for the supposed organization was The
American Fact-Finding Committee.<a id="FNanchor_C6-475" href="#Footnote_C6-475" class="fnanchor">C6-475</a> This was “Solely a name,”
Weissman testified; “* * * As a matter of fact, when I went to place
the ad, I could not remember the name * * * I had to refer to a piece
of paper for the name.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-476" href="#Footnote_C6-476" class="fnanchor">C6-476</a> Weissman’s own name was used on the ad
in part to counter charges of anti-Semitism which had been leveled
against conservative groups in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-477" href="#Footnote_C6-477" class="fnanchor">C6-477</a> Weissman conceived the
idea of using a black border,<a id="FNanchor_C6-478" href="#Footnote_C6-478" class="fnanchor">C6-478</a> and testified he intended it to serve the
function of stimulating reader attention.<a id="FNanchor_C6-479" href="#Footnote_C6-479" class="fnanchor">C6-479</a> Before accepting the
advertisement, the Dallas Morning News apparently submitted it to
its attorneys for their opinion as to whether its publication might
subject them to liability.<a id="FNanchor_C6-480" href="#Footnote_C6-480" class="fnanchor">C6-480</a></p>

<p>Weissman testified that the advertisement drew 50 or 60 mailed
responses.<a id="FNanchor_C6-481" href="#Footnote_C6-481" class="fnanchor">C6-481</a> He took them from the post office box early on Sunday
morning, November 24.<a id="FNanchor_C6-482" href="#Footnote_C6-482" class="fnanchor">C6-482</a> He said that those postmarked before the
attack on President Kennedy were “favorable” in tone;<a id="FNanchor_C6-483" href="#Footnote_C6-483" class="fnanchor">C6-483</a> those of
later postmark were violently unfavorable, nasty, and threatening;<a id="FNanchor_C6-484" href="#Footnote_C6-484" class="fnanchor">C6-484</a>
and, according to a report from Schmidt, those postmarked some
weeks later were again of favorable tone.<a id="FNanchor_C6-485" href="#Footnote_C6-485" class="fnanchor">C6-485</a></p>

<p>The four promoters of the ad deny that they had any knowledge of
or familiarity with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to November 22, or Jack
Ruby prior to November 24.<a id="FNanchor_C6-486" href="#Footnote_C6-486" class="fnanchor">C6-486</a> Each has provided a statement of his
role in connection with the placement of the November 22 advertisement
and other matters, and investigation has revealed no deception.
The Commission has found no evidence that any of these persons was
connected with Oswald or Ruby, or was linked to a conspiracy to
assassinate President Kennedy.</p>

<p>The advertisement, however, did give rise to one allegation concerning
Bernard Weissman which required additional investigation.
On March 4, 1964, Mark Lane, a New York attorney, testified before
the Commission that an undisclosed informant had told him that
Weissman had met with Jack Ruby and Patrolman J. D. Tippit at
Ruby’s Carousel Club on November 14, 1963. Lane declined to
state the name of his informant but said that he would attempt to
obtain his informant’s permission to reveal his name.<a id="FNanchor_C6-487" href="#Footnote_C6-487" class="fnanchor">C6-487</a> On July 2,
1964, after repeated requests by the Commission that he disclose the
name of his informant, Lane testified a second time concerning this
matter, but declined to reveal the information, stating as his reason
that he had promised the individual that his name would not be revealed
without his permission.<a id="FNanchor_C6-488" href="#Footnote_C6-488" class="fnanchor">C6-488</a> Lane also made this allegation during
a radio appearance, whereupon Weissman twice demanded that
Lane reveal the name of the informant.<a id="FNanchor_C6-489" href="#Footnote_C6-489" class="fnanchor">C6-489</a> As of the date of this
report Lane has failed to reveal the name of his informant and has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
offered no evidence to support his allegation. The Commission has
investigated the allegation of a Weissman-Ruby-Tippit meeting and
has found no evidence that such a meeting took place anywhere at
any time. The investigation into this matter is discussed in a later
section of this chapter dealing with possible conspiracies involving
Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>A comparable incident was the appearance of the “Wanted for
Treason” handbill on the streets of Dallas 1 to 2 days before President
Kennedy’s arrival. These handbills bore a reproduction of a front
and profile photograph of the President and set forth a series of inflammatory
charges against him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-490" href="#Footnote_C6-490" class="fnanchor">C6-490</a> Efforts to locate the author and
the lithography printer of the handbill at first met with evasive
responses<a id="FNanchor_C6-491" href="#Footnote_C6-491" class="fnanchor">C6-491</a> and refusals to furnish information.<a id="FNanchor_C6-492" href="#Footnote_C6-492" class="fnanchor">C6-492</a> Robert A. Surrey
was eventually identified as the author of the handbill.<a id="FNanchor_C6-493" href="#Footnote_C6-493" class="fnanchor">C6-493</a> Surrey,
a 38-year-old printing salesman employed by Johnson Printing Co.
of Dallas, Tex., has been closely associated with General Walker
for several years in his political and business activities.<a id="FNanchor_C6-494" href="#Footnote_C6-494" class="fnanchor">C6-494</a> He is president
of American Eagle Publishing Co. of Dallas, in which he is a
partner with General Walker.<a id="FNanchor_C6-495" href="#Footnote_C6-495" class="fnanchor">C6-495</a> Its office and address is the post office
box of Johnson Printing Co. Its assets consist of cash and various
printed materials composed chiefly of General Walker’s political and
promotional literature,<a id="FNanchor_C6-496" href="#Footnote_C6-496" class="fnanchor">C6-496</a> all of which is stored at General Walker’s
headquarters.<a id="FNanchor_C6-497" href="#Footnote_C6-497" class="fnanchor">C6-497</a></p>

<p>Surrey prepared the text for the handbill and apparently used
Johnson Printing Co. facilities to set the type and print a proof.<a id="FNanchor_C6-498" href="#Footnote_C6-498" class="fnanchor">C6-498</a>
Surrey induced Klause, a salesman employed by Lettercraft Printing
Co. of Dallas,<a id="FNanchor_C6-499" href="#Footnote_C6-499" class="fnanchor">C6-499</a> whom Surrey had met when both were employed at
Johnson Printing Co.,<a id="FNanchor_C6-500" href="#Footnote_C6-500" class="fnanchor">C6-500</a> to print the handbill “on the side.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-501" href="#Footnote_C6-501" class="fnanchor">C6-501</a> According
to Klause, Surrey contacted him initially approximately 2 or
2½ weeks prior to November 22.<a id="FNanchor_C6-502" href="#Footnote_C6-502" class="fnanchor">C6-502</a> About a week prior to November
22, Surrey delivered to Klause two slick paper magazine prints of
photographs of a front view and profile of President Kennedy,<a id="FNanchor_C6-503" href="#Footnote_C6-503" class="fnanchor">C6-503</a>
together with the textual page proof.<a id="FNanchor_C6-504" href="#Footnote_C6-504" class="fnanchor">C6-504</a> Klause was unable to make
the photographic negative of the prints needed to prepare the photographic
printing plate,<a id="FNanchor_C6-505" href="#Footnote_C6-505" class="fnanchor">C6-505</a> so that he had this feature of the job done
at a local shop.<a id="FNanchor_C6-506" href="#Footnote_C6-506" class="fnanchor">C6-506</a> Klause then arranged the halftone front and profile
representations of President Kennedy at the top of the textual
material he had received from Surrey so as to simulate a “man wanted”
police placard. He then made a photographic printing plate of the
picture.<a id="FNanchor_C6-507" href="#Footnote_C6-507" class="fnanchor">C6-507</a> During the night, he and his wife surreptitiously printed
approximately 5,000 copies on Lettercraft Printing Co. offset printing
equipment without the knowledge of his employers.<a id="FNanchor_C6-508" href="#Footnote_C6-508" class="fnanchor">C6-508</a> The next day
he arranged with Surrey a meeting place, and delivered the handbills.<a id="FNanchor_C6-509" href="#Footnote_C6-509" class="fnanchor">C6-509</a>
Klause’s charge for the printing of the handbills was, including
expenses, $60.<a id="FNanchor_C6-510" href="#Footnote_C6-510" class="fnanchor">C6-510</a></p>

<p>At the outset of the investigation Klause stated to Federal agents
that he did not know the name of his customer, whom he incorrectly
described;<a id="FNanchor_C6-511" href="#Footnote_C6-511" class="fnanchor">C6-511</a> he did say, however, that the customer did not resemble
either Oswald or Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-512" href="#Footnote_C6-512" class="fnanchor">C6-512</a> Shortly before he appeared before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
Commission, Klause disclosed Surrey’s identity.<a id="FNanchor_C6-513" href="#Footnote_C6-513" class="fnanchor">C6-513</a> He explained that
no record of the transaction had been made because “he saw a chance
to make a few dollars on the side.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-514" href="#Footnote_C6-514" class="fnanchor">C6-514</a></p>

<p>Klause’s testimony receives some corroboration from Bernard Weissman’s
testimony that he saw a copy of one of the “Wanted for Treason”
handbills on the floor of General Walker’s station wagon shortly after
November 22.<a id="FNanchor_C6-515" href="#Footnote_C6-515" class="fnanchor">C6-515</a> Other details of the manner in which the handbills
were printed have also been verified.<a id="FNanchor_C6-516" href="#Footnote_C6-516" class="fnanchor">C6-516</a> Moreover, Weissman testified
that neither he nor any of his associates had anything to do with the
handbill or were acquainted with Surrey, Klause, Lettercraft Printing
Co., or Johnson Printing Co.<a id="FNanchor_C6-517" href="#Footnote_C6-517" class="fnanchor">C6-517</a> Klause and Surrey, as well as
General Walker, testified that they were unacquainted with Lee Harvey
Oswald and had not heard of him prior to the afternoon of November
22.<a id="FNanchor_C6-518" href="#Footnote_C6-518" class="fnanchor">C6-518</a> The Commission has found no evidence of any connection
between those responsible for the handbill and Lee Harvey Oswald or
the assassination.</p>

<h4 id="hdr130">Contacts With the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City and
the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C.</h4>

<p>Eight weeks before the assassination, Oswald traveled to Mexico
City where he visited both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies.<a id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> Oswald’s
wife knew of this trip before he went,<a id="FNanchor_C6-519" href="#Footnote_C6-519" class="fnanchor">C6-519</a> but she denied
such knowledge until she testified before the Commission.<a id="FNanchor_C6-520" href="#Footnote_C6-520" class="fnanchor">C6-520</a> The Commission
undertook an intensive investigation to determine Oswald’s
purpose and activities on this journey, with specific reference to reports
that Oswald was an agent of the Cuban or Soviet Governments.
As a result of its investigation, the Commission believes that it has
been able to reconstruct and explain most of Oswald’s actions during
this time. A detailed chronological account of this trip appears in
appendix XIII.</p>

<div class="footnoteb">

<p><a id="Footnote_D" href="#FNanchor_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> The Soviet Embassy in Mexico City includes consular as well as diplomatic personnel
in a single building. The Cuban Embassy and Cuban Consulate in Mexico City, though in
separate buildings, are in the same compound. Both the Soviet and the Cuban establishments
will be referred to throughout the report simply as Embassies.</p></div>

<p><i>Trip to Mexico.</i>—Oswald was in Mexico from September 26, 1963,
until October 3, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-521" href="#Footnote_C6-521" class="fnanchor">C6-521</a> (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 2478, 2481, <a href="#Page_300">p.
300</a>.) Marina Oswald testified that Oswald had told her that the purpose
of the trip was to evade the American prohibition on travel to
Cuba and to reach that country.<a id="FNanchor_C6-522" href="#Footnote_C6-522" class="fnanchor">C6-522</a> He cautioned her that the trip and
its purpose were to be kept strictly secret.<a id="FNanchor_C6-523" href="#Footnote_C6-523" class="fnanchor">C6-523</a> She testified that he had
earlier laid plans to reach Cuba by hijacking an airliner flying out of
New Orleans, but she refused to cooperate and urged him to give it up,
which he finally did.<a id="FNanchor_C6-524" href="#Footnote_C6-524" class="fnanchor">C6-524</a> Witnesses who spoke with Oswald while he
was on a bus going to Mexico City also testified that Oswald told
them he intended to reach Cuba by way of Mexico, and that he hoped
to meet Fidel Castro after he arrived.<a id="FNanchor_C6-525" href="#Footnote_C6-525" class="fnanchor">C6-525</a> When Oswald spoke to
the Cuban and Soviet consular officials in Mexico City, he represented
that he intended to travel to the Soviet Union and requested
an “in-transit” Cuban visa to permit him to enter Cuba on September
30 on the way to the Soviet Union. Marina Oswald has
testified that these statements were deceptions designed to get him to
Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_C6-526" href="#Footnote_C6-526" class="fnanchor">C6-526</a> Thus, although it is possible that Oswald intended to continue
on to Russia from Cuba, the evidence makes it more likely that
he intended to remain in Cuba.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-527" href="#Footnote_C6-527" class="fnanchor">C6-527</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
Oswald departed from New Orleans probably about noon on September
25 and arrived in Mexico City at about 10 a.m. on September
27.<a id="FNanchor_C6-528" href="#Footnote_C6-528" class="fnanchor">C6-528</a> In Mexico City he embarked on a series of visits to the
Soviet and Cuban Embassies, which occupied most of his time during
the first 2 days of his visit. At the Cuban Embassy, he requested
an “in-transit” visa to permit him to visit Cuba on his way to the
Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_C6-529" href="#Footnote_C6-529" class="fnanchor">C6-529</a> Oswald was informed that he could not obtain
a visa for entry into Cuba unless he first obtained a visa to enter
the U.S.S.R.,<a id="FNanchor_C6-530" href="#Footnote_C6-530" class="fnanchor">C6-530</a> and the Soviet Embassy told him that he could not
expect an answer on his application for a visa for the Soviet Union
for about 4 months.<a id="FNanchor_C6-531" href="#Footnote_C6-531" class="fnanchor">C6-531</a> Oswald carried with him newspaper clippings,
letters and various documents, some of them forged or containing
false information, purporting to show that he was a “friend” of
Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_C6-532" href="#Footnote_C6-532" class="fnanchor">C6-532</a> With these papers and his record of previous residence in
the Soviet Union and marriage to a Soviet national, he tried to
curry favor with both Embassies.<a id="FNanchor_C6-533" href="#Footnote_C6-533" class="fnanchor">C6-533</a> Indeed, his wife testified that
in her opinion Oswald’s primary purpose in having engaged in
Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities was to create a public record
that he was a “friend” of Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_C6-534" href="#Footnote_C6-534" class="fnanchor">C6-534</a> He made himself especially unpopular
at the Cuban Embassy by persisting in his demands that as a
sympathizer in Cuban objectives he ought to be given a visa. This
resulted in a sharp argument with the consul, Eusebio Azque.<a id="FNanchor_C6-535" href="#Footnote_C6-535" class="fnanchor">C6-535</a></p>

<p>By Saturday, September 28, 1963, Oswald had failed to obtain visas
at both Embassies.<a id="FNanchor_C6-536" href="#Footnote_C6-536" class="fnanchor">C6-536</a> From Sunday, September 29, through Wednesday
morning, October 2, when he left Mexico City on a bus bound for
the United States, Oswald spent considerable time making his travel
arrangements, sightseeing and checking again with the Soviet Embassy
to learn whether anything had happened on his visa application.<a id="FNanchor_C6-537" href="#Footnote_C6-537" class="fnanchor">C6-537</a>
Marina Oswald testified that when she first saw him after
his return to the United States he was disappointed and discouraged
at his failure to reach Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_C6-538" href="#Footnote_C6-538" class="fnanchor">C6-538</a></p>

<p>The general outlines of Oswald’s activities in Mexico, particularly
the nature and extent of his contacts at the Cuban Embassy, were
learned very early in the investigation. An important source of information
relating to his business at the Cuban Embassy was Senora
Silvia Tirado de Duran, a Mexican national employed in the visa section
of the Cuban Embassy, who was questioned intensively by Mexican
authorities soon after the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-539" href="#Footnote_C6-539" class="fnanchor">C6-539</a> An excerpt from the report
of the Mexican Government summarized the crucial portion of Senora
Duran’s recollection of Oswald. In translation it reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * she remembered * * * [that Lee Harvey Oswald] was the
name of an American who had come to the Cuban Consulate to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
obtain a visa to travel to Cuba in transit to Russia, the latter part
of September or the early part of October of this year, and in
support of his application had shown his passport, in which it was
noted that he had lived in that country for a period of three years;
his labor card from the same country written in the Russian language;
and letters in that same language. He had presented evidence
that he was married to a Russian woman, and also that he
was apparently the leader of an organization in the city of New
Orleans called “Fair * * * [Play] for Cuba,” claiming that he
should be accepted as a “friend” of the Cuban Revolution. Accordingly,
the declarant, complying with her duties, took down
all of the information and completed the appropriate application
form; and the declarant, admittedly exceeding her responsibilities,
informally telephoned the Russian consulate, with the intention
of doing what she could to facilitate issuance of the Russian
visa to Lee Harvey Oswald. However, they told her that
there would be a delay of about four months in processing the case,
which annoyed the applicant since, according to his statement,
he was in a great hurry to obtain visas that would enable him to
travel to Russia, insisting on his right to do so in view of his background
and his loyalty and his activities in behalf of the Cuban
movement. The declarant was unable to recall accurately
whether or not the applicant told her he was a member of the
Communist Party, but he did say that his wife * * * was then
in New York City, and would follow him, * * * [Senora Duran
stated] that when Oswald understood that it was not possible to
give him a Cuban visa without his first having obtained the Russian
visa, * * * he became very excited or angry, and accordingly,
the affiant called Consul Ascue [sic], * * * [who] came out
and began a heated discussion in English with Oswald, that concluded
by Ascue telling him that “if it were up to him, he would
not give him the visa,” and “a person of his type was harming
the Cuban Revolution rather than helping it,” it being understood
that in their conversation they were talking about the Russian
Socialist Revolution and not the Cuban. Oswald maintained
that he had two reasons for requesting that his visa be
issued promptly, and they were: one, that his tourist permit in
Mexico was about to expire; and the other, that he had to get to
Russia as quickly as possible. Despite her annoyance, the declarant
gave Oswald a paper * * * in which she put down her
name, “Silvia Durán,” and the number of the telephone at the
consulate, which is “11-28-47” and the visa application was processed
anyway. It was sent to the Ministry of [Foreign] Relations
of Cuba, from which a routine reply was received some
fifteen to thirty days later, approving the visa, but on the condition
that the Russian visa be obtained first, although she does
not recall whether or not Oswald later telephoned her at the
Consulate number that she gave him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-540" href="#Footnote_C6-540" class="fnanchor">C6-540</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
With the dates of Oswald’s entry into and departure from Mexico,
which had been obtained from the records of the Mexican Immigration
Service very shortly after the assassination, the Government of
Mexico initiated a thorough investigation to uncover as much information
as possible on Oswald’s trip.<a id="FNanchor_C6-541" href="#Footnote_C6-541" class="fnanchor">C6-541</a> Representatives of U.S. agencies
worked in close liaison with the Mexican law enforcement
authorities. The result of this investigative effort was to corroborate
the statements of Senora Duran and to verify the essentials of Oswald’s
activities in Mexico as outlined above.</p>

<p>Senora Duran is a well-educated native of Mexico, who was 26
years old at the time of her interrogation. She is married to Senor
Horacio Duran Navarro, a 40-year-old industrial designer, and has
a young child. Although Senora Duran denies being a member of the
Communist Party or otherwise connected with it, both Durans have
been active in far left political affairs in Mexico, believe in Marxist
ideology, and sympathize with the government of Fidel Castro,<a id="FNanchor_C6-542" href="#Footnote_C6-542" class="fnanchor">C6-542</a>
and Senor Duran has written articles for El Dia, a pro-Communist
newspaper in Mexico City.<a id="FNanchor_C6-543" href="#Footnote_C6-543" class="fnanchor">C6-543</a> The Commission has reliable evidence
from a confidential source that Senora Duran as well as
other personnel at the Cuban Embassy were genuinely upset upon
receiving news of President Kennedy’s death. Senora Duran’s
statements were made to Mexican officials soon after the assassination,<a id="FNanchor_C6-544" href="#Footnote_C6-544" class="fnanchor">C6-544</a>
and no significant inaccuracies in them have been detected.
Documents fitting the description given by Senora Duran of the
documents Oswald had shown her, plus a notation which she said
she had given him, were found among his possessions after his
arrest.<a id="FNanchor_C6-545" href="#Footnote_C6-545" class="fnanchor">C6-545</a></p>

<p>The Cuban Government was asked to document and confirm the
essentials of Senora Duran’s testimony. Its response, which has been
included in its entirety in this Report, included a summary statement
of Oswald’s activities at the Cuban Embassy;<a id="FNanchor_C6-546" href="#Footnote_C6-546" class="fnanchor">C6-546</a> a photograph of the
application for a visa he completed there,<a id="FNanchor_C6-547" href="#Footnote_C6-547" class="fnanchor">C6-547</a> and a photograph of the
communication from Havana rejecting the application unless he could
first present a Soviet visa.<a id="FNanchor_C6-548" href="#Footnote_C6-548" class="fnanchor">C6-548</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 2564,
<a href="#Page_306">p. 306</a>.) The information on these documents concerning Oswald’s
date of birth, American passport number and activities and statements
at the Embassy is consistent with other information available to the
Commission.<a id="FNanchor_C6-549" href="#Footnote_C6-549" class="fnanchor">C6-549</a> CIA experts have given their opinion that the handwriting
on the visa application which purports to be Oswald’s is in
fact his and that, although the handwritten notations on the bottom
of the document are too brief and faint to permit a conclusive determination,
they are probably Senora Duran’s.<a id="FNanchor_C6-550" href="#Footnote_C6-550" class="fnanchor">C6-550</a> The clothes which
Oswald was wearing in the photograph which appears on the application
appear to be the same as some of those found among his effects
after the assassination, and the photograph itself appears to be from
the same negative as a photograph found among his effects.<a id="FNanchor_C6-551" href="#Footnote_C6-551" class="fnanchor">C6-551</a> Nothing
on any of the documents raises a suspicion that they might not be
authentic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
By far the most important confirmation of Senora Duran’s testimony,
however, has been supplied by confidential sources of extremely
high reliability available to the United States in Mexico. The information
from these sources establishes that her testimony was truthful
and accurate in all material respects. The identities of these sources
cannot be disclosed without destroying their future usefulness to the
United States.</p>

<p>The investigation of the Commission has produced considerable
testimonial and documentary evidence establishing the precise time
of Oswald’s journey, his means of transportation, the hotel at which
he stayed in Mexico City, and a restaurant at which he often ate.
All known persons whom Oswald may have met while in Mexico, including
passengers on the buses he rode,<a id="FNanchor_C6-552" href="#Footnote_C6-552" class="fnanchor">C6-552</a> and the employees and
guests of the hotel where he stayed,<a id="FNanchor_C6-553" href="#Footnote_C6-553" class="fnanchor">C6-553</a> were interviewed. No credible
witness has been located who saw Oswald with any unidentified person
while in Mexico City; to the contrary, he was observed traveling alone
to and from Mexico City,<a id="FNanchor_C6-554" href="#Footnote_C6-554" class="fnanchor">C6-554</a> at his hotel,<a id="FNanchor_C6-555" href="#Footnote_C6-555" class="fnanchor">C6-555</a> and at the nearby restaurant
where he frequently ate.<a id="FNanchor_C6-556" href="#Footnote_C6-556" class="fnanchor">C6-556</a> A hotel guest stated that on one occasion
he sat down at a table with Oswald at the restaurant because no empty
table was available, but that neither spoke to the other because of the
language barrier.<a id="FNanchor_C6-557" href="#Footnote_C6-557" class="fnanchor">C6-557</a> Two Australian girls who saw Oswald on the
bus to Mexico City relate that he occupied a seat next to a man who
has been identified as Albert Osborne, an elderly itinerant preacher.<a id="FNanchor_C6-558" href="#Footnote_C6-558" class="fnanchor">C6-558</a>
Osborne denies that Oswald was beside him on the bus.<a id="FNanchor_C6-559" href="#Footnote_C6-559" class="fnanchor">C6-559</a> To the
other passengers on the bus it appeared that Osborne and Oswald had
not previously met,<a id="FNanchor_C6-560" href="#Footnote_C6-560" class="fnanchor">C6-560</a> and extensive investigation of Osborne has
revealed no further contact between him and Oswald. Osborne’s
responses to Federal investigators on matters unrelated to Oswald
have proved inconsistent and unreliable, and, therefore, based on the
contrary evidence and Osborne’s lack of reliability, the Commission
has attached no credence to his denial that Oswald was beside
him on the bus. Investigation of his background and activities, however,
disclose no basis for suspecting him of any involvement in the
assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-561" href="#Footnote_C6-561" class="fnanchor">C6-561</a></p>

<p>Investigation of the hotel at which Oswald stayed has failed to
uncover any evidence that the hotel is unusual in any way that could relate
to Oswald’s visit. It is not especially popular among Cubans, and
there is no indication that it is used as a meeting place for extremist
or revolutionary organizations.<a id="FNanchor_C6-562" href="#Footnote_C6-562" class="fnanchor">C6-562</a> Investigation of other guests of
the hotel who were there when Oswald was has failed to uncover anything
creating suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_C6-563" href="#Footnote_C6-563" class="fnanchor">C6-563</a> Oswald’s notebook which he carried with
him to Mexico City contained the telephone number of the Cuban Airlines
Office in Mexico City;<a id="FNanchor_C6-564" href="#Footnote_C6-564" class="fnanchor">C6-564</a> however, a Cuban visa is required by
Mexican authorities before an individual may enplane for Cuba,<a id="FNanchor_C6-565" href="#Footnote_C6-565" class="fnanchor">C6-565</a> and
a confidential check of the Cuban Airlines Office uncovered no evidence
that Oswald visited their offices while in the city.<a id="FNanchor_C6-566" href="#Footnote_C6-566" class="fnanchor">C6-566</a></p>

<p><i>Allegations of conspiracy.</i>—Literally dozens of allegations of a conspiratorial
contact between Oswald and agents of the Cuban Government
have been investigated by the Commission. Among the claims
made were allegations that Oswald had made a previous trip to
Mexico City in early September to receive money and orders for the
assassination,<a id="FNanchor_C6-567" href="#Footnote_C6-567" class="fnanchor">C6-567</a> that he had been flown to a secret airfield somewhere in
or near the Yucatan Peninsula,<a id="FNanchor_C6-568" href="#Footnote_C6-568" class="fnanchor">C6-568</a> that he might have made contacts in
Mexico City with a Communist from the United States shortly
before the assassination,<a id="FNanchor_C6-569" href="#Footnote_C6-569" class="fnanchor">C6-569</a> and that Oswald assassinated the President
at the direction of a particular Cuban agent who met with him in
the United States and paid him $7,000.<a id="FNanchor_C6-570" href="#Footnote_C6-570" class="fnanchor">C6-570</a> A letter was received from
someone in Cuba alleging the writer had attended a meeting where
the assassination had been discussed as part of a plan which would
soon include the death of other non-Communist leaders in the Americas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-571" href="#Footnote_C6-571" class="fnanchor">C6-571</a>
The charge was made in a Cuban expatriate publication that in
a speech he delivered 5 days after the assassination, while he was under
the influence of liquor, Fidel Castro made a slip of the tongue and said,
“The first time Oswald was in Cuba,” thereby giving away the
fact that Oswald had made one or more surreptitious trips to that
country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-572" href="#Footnote_C6-572" class="fnanchor">C6-572</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
Some stories linked the assassination to anti-Castro groups who
allegedly were engaged in obtaining illicit firearms in the United
States, one such claim being that these groups killed the President as
part of a bargain with some illicit organizations who would then
supply them with firearms as payment.<a id="FNanchor_C6-573" href="#Footnote_C6-573" class="fnanchor">C6-573</a> Other rumors placed
Oswald in Miami, Fla., at various times, allegedly in pro-Cuban activities
there.<a id="FNanchor_C6-574" href="#Footnote_C6-574" class="fnanchor">C6-574</a> The assassination was claimed to have been carried
out by Chinese Communists operating jointly with the Cubans.<a id="FNanchor_C6-575" href="#Footnote_C6-575" class="fnanchor">C6-575</a>
Oswald was also alleged to have met with the Cuban Ambassador in
a Mexico City restaurant and to have driven off in the Ambassador’s
car for a private talk.<a id="FNanchor_C6-576" href="#Footnote_C6-576" class="fnanchor">C6-576</a> Castro himself, it was alleged, 2 days after
the assassination called for the files relating to Oswald’s dealings with
two members of the Cuban diplomatic mission in the Soviet Union;
the inference drawn was that the “dealings” had occurred and had
established a secret subversive relationship which continued through
Oswald’s life.<a id="FNanchor_C6-577" href="#Footnote_C6-577" class="fnanchor">C6-577</a> Without exception, the rumors and allegations of
a conspiratorial contact were shown to be without any factual basis,
in some cases the product of mistaken identification.</p>

<p>Illustrative of the attention given to the most serious allegations
is the case of “D,” a young Latin American secret agent who approached
U.S. authorities in Mexico shortly after the assassination
and declared that he saw Lee Harvey Oswald receiving $6,500 to kill
the President. Among other details, “D” said that at about noon on
September 18, waiting to conduct some business at the Cuban consulate,
he saw a group of three persons conversing in a patio a few
feet away. One was a tall, thin Negro with reddish hair, obviously
dyed, who spoke rapidly in both Spanish and English, and another
was a man he said was Lee Harvey Oswald. A tall Cuban joined the
group momentarily and passed some currency to the Negro. The
Negro then allegedly said to Oswald in English, “I want to kill the
man.” Oswald replied, “You’re not man enough, I can do it.” The
Negro then said in Spanish, “I can’t go with you, I have a lot to do.”
Oswald replied, “The people are waiting for me back there.” The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
Negro then gave Oswald $6,500 in large-denomination American bills,
saying, “This isn’t much.” After hearing this conversation, “D” said
that he telephoned the American Embassy in Mexico City several
times prior to the assassination in an attempt to report his belief that
someone important in the United States was to be killed, but was
finally told by someone at the Embassy to stop wasting his time.</p>

<p>“D” and his allegations were immediately subjected to intensive
investigation. His former employment as an agent for a Latin American
country was confirmed, although his superiors had no knowledge
of his presence in Mexico or the assignment described by “D.” Four
days after “D” first appeared the U.S. Government was informed by
the Mexican authorities that “D” had admitted in writing that his
whole narrative about Oswald was false. He said that he had never
seen Oswald anyplace, and that he had not seen anybody paid money
in the Cuban Embassy. He also admitted that he never tried to telephone
the American Embassy in September and that his first call to
the Embassy was after the assassination. “D” said that his motive in
fabricating the story was to help get himself admitted into the United
States so that he could there participate in action against Fidel Castro.
He said that he hated Castro and hoped that the story he made up
would be believed and would cause the United States to “take action”
against him.</p>

<p>Still later, when questioned by American authorities, “D” claimed
that he had been pressured into retracting his statement by the Mexican
police and that the retraction, rather than his first statement,
was false. A portion of the American questioning was carried on
with the use of a polygraph machine, with the consent of “D.” When
told that the machine indicated that he was probably lying, “D” said
words to the effect that he “must be mistaken.” Investigation in the
meantime had disclosed that the Embassy extension number “D” said
he had called would not have given him the person he said he spoke
to, and that no one at the Embassy—clerks, secretaries, or officers—had
any recollection of his calls. In addition, Oswald spoke little, if
any, Spanish. That he could have carried on the alleged conversation
with the red-headed Negro in the Cuban Embassy, part of which was
supposed to have been in Spanish, was therefore doubtful. “D” now
said that he was uncertain as to the date when he saw “someone who
looked like Oswald” at the Cuban Embassy, and upon reconsideration,
he now thought it was on a Tuesday, September 17, rather than September
18. On September 17, however, Oswald visited the Louisiana
State Unemployment Commission in New Orleans and also cashed a
check from the Texas Employment Commission at the Winn-Dixie
Store No. 1425 in New Orleans. On the basis of the retractions made
by “D” when he heard the results of the polygraph examination, and
on the basis of discrepancies which appeared in his story, it was
concluded that “D” was lying.<a id="FNanchor_C6-578" href="#Footnote_C6-578" class="fnanchor">C6-578</a></p>

<p>The investigation of the Commission has thus produced no evidence
that Oswald’s trip to Mexico was in any way connected with the assassination
of President Kennedy, nor has it uncovered evidence that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
Cuban Government had any involvement in the assassination. To
the contrary, the Commission has been advised by the CIA and FBI
that secret and reliable sources corroborate the statements of Senora
Duran in all material respects, and that the Cuban Government had
no relationship with Lee Harvey Oswald other than that described by
Senora Duran. Secretary of State Rusk also testified that
after the assassination “there was very considerable concern in Cuba
as to whether they would be held responsible and what the effect of
that might be on their own position and their own safety.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-579" href="#Footnote_C6-579" class="fnanchor">C6-579</a></p>

<p><i>Contacts with the Soviet Embassy in the United States.</i>—Soon after
the Oswalds reached the United States in June 1962 they wrote to
the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. Oswald requested information
about subscriptions to Russian newspapers and magazines and
ultimately did subscribe to several Russian journals. Soviet law required
Marina Oswald, as a Soviet citizen living abroad, to remain in
contact with her nation’s Embassy and to file various papers occasionally.<a id="FNanchor_C6-580" href="#Footnote_C6-580" class="fnanchor">C6-580</a>
In 1963, after Oswald had experienced repeated employment
difficulties, there were further letters when the Oswalds sought
permission to return to the Soviet Union. The first such request was a
letter written by Marina Oswald on February 17, 1963. She wrote that
she wished to return to Russia but that her husband would stay in the
United States because “he is an American by nationality.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-581" href="#Footnote_C6-581" class="fnanchor">C6-581</a> She
was informed on March 8, 1963, that it would take from 5 to 6 months
to process the application.<a id="FNanchor_C6-582" href="#Footnote_C6-582" class="fnanchor">C6-582</a> The Soviet Union made available to the
Commission what purports to be the entire correspondence between
the Oswalds and the Russian Embassy in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_C6-583" href="#Footnote_C6-583" class="fnanchor">C6-583</a> This
material has been checked for codes and none has been detected.<a id="FNanchor_C6-584" href="#Footnote_C6-584" class="fnanchor">C6-584</a>
With the possible exception of a letter which Oswald wrote to the
Soviet Embassy after his return from Mexico City, discussed below,
there is no material which gives any reason for suspicion. The implications
of all of this correspondence for an understanding of Lee
Harvey Oswald’s personality and motivation is discussed in the
following chapter.</p>

<p>Oswald’s last letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C.,
dated November 9, 1963, began by stating that it was written “to
inform you of recent events since my meetings with Comrade Kostin
in the Embassy of the Soviet Union, Mexico City, Mexico.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-585" href="#Footnote_C6-585" class="fnanchor">C6-585</a> The
envelope bears a postmark which appears to be November 12, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-586" href="#Footnote_C6-586" class="fnanchor">C6-586</a>
Ruth Paine has testified that Oswald spent the weekend at her home
working on the letter and that she observed one preliminary draft.<a id="FNanchor_C6-587" href="#Footnote_C6-587" class="fnanchor">C6-587</a>
A piece of paper which was identified as one of these drafts was found
among Oswald’s effects after the assassination. (See Commission
Exhibits Nos. 15, 103, <a href="#Page_311">p. 311</a>.) According to Marina Oswald, her
husband retyped the envelope 10 times.<a id="FNanchor_C6-588" href="#Footnote_C6-588" class="fnanchor">C6-588</a></p>

<p>Information produced for the Commission by the CIA is to the
effect that the person referred to in the letter as “comrade Kostin” was
probably Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov, a member of the consular
staff of the Soviet Union in Mexico City. He is also one of the KGB
officers stationed at the Embassy.<a id="FNanchor_C6-589" href="#Footnote_C6-589" class="fnanchor">C6-589</a> It is standard Soviet procedure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
for KGB officers stationed in embassies and in consulates
to carry on the normal duties of such a position in addition to the
undercover activities.<a id="FNanchor_C6-590" href="#Footnote_C6-590" class="fnanchor">C6-590</a> The Commission has identified the Cuban
consul referred to in Oswald’s letter as Senor Eusebio Azque (also
“Ascue”), the man with whom Oswald argued at the Cuban Embassy,
who was in fact replaced. The CIA advised the Commission:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We surmise that the references in Oswald’s 9 November letter
to a man who had since been replaced must refer to Cuban Consul
Eusebio Azque, who left Mexico for Cuba on permanent transfer
on 18 November 1963, four days before the assassination. Azque
had been in Mexico for 18 years and it was known as early as
September 1963 that Azque was to be replaced. His replacement
did arrive in September. Azque was scheduled to leave in October
but did not leave until 18 November.</p>

<p>We do not know who might have told Oswald that Azque or
any other Cuban had been or was to be replaced, but we speculate
that Silvia Duran or some Soviet official might have mentioned
it if Oswald complained about Azque’s altercation with him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-591" href="#Footnote_C6-591" class="fnanchor">C6-591</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When asked to explain the letter, Marina Oswald was unable to add
anything to an understanding of its contents.<a id="FNanchor_C6-592" href="#Footnote_C6-592" class="fnanchor">C6-592</a> Some light on its
possible meaning can be shed by comparing it with the early
draft. When the differences between the draft and the final document
are studied, and especially when crossed-out words are taken
into account, it becomes apparent that Oswald was intentionally beclouding
the true state of affairs in order to make his trip to Mexico
sound as mysterious and important as possible.</p>

<p>For example, the first sentence in the second paragraph of the letter
reads, “I was unable to remain in Mexico indefinily because of my
mexican visa restrictions which was for 15 days only.” The same sentence
in the draft begins, before the words are crossed out, “I was
unable to remain in Mexico City because I considered useless * * *”
As already mentioned, the Commission has good evidence that Oswald’s
trip to Mexico was indeed “useless” and that he returned to
Texas with that conviction. The first draft, therefore, spoke the
truth; but Oswald rewrote the sentence to imply that he had to leave
because his visa was about to expire. This is false; Oswald’s tourist
card still had a full week to run when he departed from Mexico on
October 3.<a id="FNanchor_C6-593" href="#Footnote_C6-593" class="fnanchor">C6-593</a></p>

<p>The next sentence in the letter reads, “I could not take a chance on
reqesting a new visa unless I used my real name, so I returned to the
United States.” The fact is that he did use his real name for his
tourist card, and in all dealings with the Cuban Embassy, the Russian
Embassy and elsewhere. Oswald did use the name of “Lee” on the
trip, but as indicated below, he did so only sporadically and probably
as the result of a clerical error. In the opinion of the Commission,
based upon its knowledge of Oswald, the letter constitutes no more
than a clumsy effort to ingratiate himself with the Soviet Embassy.</p>

<h4 id="hdr131">Investigation of Other Activities</h4>

<p><i>Oswald’s use of post office boxes and false names.</i>—After his return
from the Soviet Union, Lee Harvey Oswald is known to have received
his mail at post office boxes and to have used different aliases on numerous
occasions. Since either practice is susceptible of use for clandestine
purposes, the Commission has directed attention to both for
signs that Oswald at some point made undercover contact with other
persons who might have been connected with the assassination.</p>

<p>Oswald is known to have opened three post office boxes during 1962
and 1963. On October 9, 1962, the same day that he arrived in Dallas
from Fort Worth, and before establishing a residence there, he opened
box No. 2915 at the Dallas General Post Office. This box was closed
on May 14, 1963, shortly after Oswald had moved to New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_C6-594" href="#Footnote_C6-594" class="fnanchor">C6-594</a>
That portion of the post office box application listing the names of
those persons other than the applicant entitled to receive mail at the
box was discarded in accordance with postal regulations after the box
was closed; hence, it is not known what names other than Oswald’s
were listed on that form.<a id="FNanchor_C6-595" href="#Footnote_C6-595" class="fnanchor">C6-595</a> However, as discussed in chapter IV,
Oswald is known to have received the assassination rifle under the
name of A. Hidell and his Smith &amp; Wesson revolver under the name
of A. J. Hidell at that box.<a id="FNanchor_C6-596" href="#Footnote_C6-596" class="fnanchor">C6-596</a> On June 3, 1963, Oswald opened box
No. 30061 at the Lafayette Square Substation in New Orleans.
Marina Oswald and A. J. Hidell were listed as additional persons
entitled to receive mail at this box.<a id="FNanchor_C6-597" href="#Footnote_C6-597" class="fnanchor">C6-597</a> Immediately before leaving
for Mexico City in late September, Oswald submitted a request to
forward his mail to the Paines’ address in Irving, and the box was
closed on September 26.<a id="FNanchor_C6-598" href="#Footnote_C6-598" class="fnanchor">C6-598</a> On November 1, 1963, he opened box No.
6225 at the Dallas Post Office Terminal Annex. The Fair Play for
Cuba Committee and the American Civil Liberties Union were listed
as also being entitled to receive mail at this box.<a id="FNanchor_C6-599" href="#Footnote_C6-599" class="fnanchor">C6-599</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s use of post office boxes is consistent with other information
known about him. His frequent changes of address and receipt of
Communist and other political literature would appear to have provided
Oswald reason to have rented postal boxes. These were the
explanations for his use of the boxes which he provided Postal Inspector
H. D. Holmes on November 24.<a id="FNanchor_C6-600" href="#Footnote_C6-600" class="fnanchor">C6-600</a> Moreover, on October 14,
1963, he had moved into a room on Beckley Avenue under the name of
O. H. Lee<a id="FNanchor_C6-601" href="#Footnote_C6-601" class="fnanchor">C6-601</a> and it would have been extremely difficult for Oswald
to have received his mail at that address without having disclosed his
true name. The boxes cost Oswald only $1.50 or less per month.<a id="FNanchor_C6-602" href="#Footnote_C6-602" class="fnanchor">C6-602</a></p>

<p>Although the possibilities of investigation in this area are limited,
there is no evidence that any of the three boxes was ever used for the
surreptitious receipt of messages or was used by persons other than
Oswald or his family. No unexplainable notes were found among
Oswald’s possessions after his arrest. Oswald’s box on the day
of the assassination, No. 6225, was kept under constant personal surveillance
by postal inspectors from about 5 p.m. November 22 until
midnight November 24. A modified surveillance was maintained thereafter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
No one called for mail out of this box; indeed the only mail in
the box was a Russian magazine addressed to Oswald. The single outstanding
key was recovered from Oswald immediately after he was
taken in custody.<a id="FNanchor_C6-603" href="#Footnote_C6-603" class="fnanchor">C6-603</a></p>

<p>In appraising the import of Oswald’s rental of post office boxes, it is
significant that he was not secretive about their use. All three boxes
were rented by Oswald using his true name.<a id="FNanchor_C6-604" href="#Footnote_C6-604" class="fnanchor">C6-604</a> His application for
box No. 2915 showed his home address as that of Alexandra De
Mohrenschildt (Taylor), whose husband had agreed to allow Oswald
to use his address.<a id="FNanchor_C6-605" href="#Footnote_C6-605" class="fnanchor">C6-605</a> His application for the New Orleans box
listed his address as 657 French Street; his aunt, Lillian Murret, lived
at 757 French Street.<a id="FNanchor_C6-606" href="#Footnote_C6-606" class="fnanchor">C6-606</a> On the application for box No. 6225, Oswald
gave an incorrect street number, though he did show Beckley Avenue,
where he was then living.<a id="FNanchor_C6-607" href="#Footnote_C6-607" class="fnanchor">C6-607</a> He furnished the box numbers to his
brother, to an employer, to Texas and New Orleans unemployment
commissions, and to others.<a id="FNanchor_C6-608" href="#Footnote_C6-608" class="fnanchor">C6-608</a> Based on all the facts disclosed by its
investigation, the Commission has attached no conspiratorial significance
to Oswald’s rental of post office boxes.</p>

<p>Oswald’s use of aliases is also well established. In chapter IV, the
evidence relating to his repeated use of the name “A. J. Hidell,” and
close variants thereof, is set forth.<a id="FNanchor_C6-609" href="#Footnote_C6-609" class="fnanchor">C6-609</a> Because Oswald’s use of this
pseudonym became known quickly after the assassination, investigations
were conducted with regard to persons using the name Hidell
or names similar to it. Subversive files, public carrier records, telegraph
company records, banking and other commercial records, and
other matters investigated and persons interviewed have been examined
with regard to Oswald’s true name and his known alias.<a id="FNanchor_C6-610" href="#Footnote_C6-610" class="fnanchor">C6-610</a> No
evidence has been produced that Oswald ever used the name Hidell
as a means of making undercover contact with any person. Indeed,
though Oswald did prepare a counterfeit selective service card and
other identification using this name, he commonly used “Hidell” to
represent persons other than himself, such as the president of his
nonexistent Fair Play for Cuba Committee chapter, the doctor whose
name appeared on his counterfeit international certificate of vaccination,
and as references on his job applications.<a id="FNanchor_C6-611" href="#Footnote_C6-611" class="fnanchor">C6-611</a></p>

<p>Alwyn Cole, questioned document expert for the Treasury Department,
testified that the false identification found on Oswald upon his
arrest could have been produced by employing elementary techniques
used in a photographic printing plant.<a id="FNanchor_C6-612" href="#Footnote_C6-612" class="fnanchor">C6-612</a> (See app. X, <a href="#Page_571">pp. 571-578</a>.)
Though to perform the necessary procedures would have been difficult
without the use of expensive photographic equipment, such equipment
and the needed film and photographic paper were available to Oswald
when he was employed from October 1962 through early April 1963
at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall, a commercial advertising photography
firm in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-613" href="#Footnote_C6-613" class="fnanchor">C6-613</a> While so employed, Oswald is known to have become
familiar with the mechanics of photographic enlargements,
contraction, and image distortion that would have been necessary to
produce his false identification, and to have used the facilities of his
employer for some personal work.<a id="FNanchor_C6-614" href="#Footnote_C6-614" class="fnanchor">C6-614</a> Cole testified that the cards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
in Oswald’s wallet did not exhibit a great deal of skill, pointing out
various errors that had been committed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-615" href="#Footnote_C6-615" class="fnanchor">C6-615</a> Oswald’s supervisor at
Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall has stated that Oswald seemed unable to perform
photographic work with precision, which was one of the main
reasons for which he was ultimately discharged.<a id="FNanchor_C6-616" href="#Footnote_C6-616" class="fnanchor">C6-616</a> The retouched
negatives used to make Oswald’s counterfeit certificate of service
identification were found among Oswald’s personal effects after his
arrest, as was a rubber stamping kit apparently employed to produce
his spurious international certificate of vaccination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-617" href="#Footnote_C6-617" class="fnanchor">C6-617</a> There is strong
evidence, therefore, that Oswald himself made the various pieces of
counterfeit identification which he carried, and there is no reason to
believe that he received assistance from any person in establishing his
alias.</p>

<p>Oswald also used incorrect names other than Hidell, but these too
appear unconnected with any form of conspiracy. Oswald’s last
name appears as “Lee” in three places in connection with his trip to
Mexico City, discussed above. His tourist card was typed by the
Mexican consulate in New Orleans, “Lee, Harvey Oswald.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-618" href="#Footnote_C6-618" class="fnanchor">C6-618</a> However,
the comma seems to have been a clerical error, since Oswald
signed both the application and the card itself, “Lee H. Oswald.”
Moreover, Oswald seems originally to have also printed his name,
evenly spaced, as “Lee H Oswald,” but, noting that the form instructed
him to “Print full name. No initials,” printed the remainder of his
middle name after the “H.” The clerk who typed the card thus saw
a space after “Lee,” followed by “Harvey Oswald” crowded together,
and probably assumed that “Lee” was the applicant’s last name. (See
Commission Exhibit 2481, <a href="#Page_300">p. 300</a>.) The clerk who prepared Oswald’s
bus reservation for his return trip wrote “H. O. Lee.” He stated that
he did not remember the occasion, although he was sure from the
handwriting and from other facts that he had dealt with Oswald.
He surmised that he probably made out the reservation directly
from the tourist card, since Oswald spoke no Spanish, and, seeing the
comma, wrote the name “H. O. Lee.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-619" href="#Footnote_C6-619" class="fnanchor">C6-619</a> Oswald himself signed the
register at the hotel in Mexico City as “Lee, Harvey Oswald,”<a id="FNanchor_C6-620" href="#Footnote_C6-620" class="fnanchor">C6-620</a> but
since the error is identical to that on the tourist card and since he
revealed the remainder of his name, “Harvey Oswald,” it is possible
that Oswald inserted the comma to conform to the tourist card, or
that the earlier mistake suggested a new pseudonym to Oswald which
he decided to continue.</p>

<p>In any event, Oswald used his correct name in making reservations
for the trip to Mexico City, in introducing himself to passengers
on the bus, and in his dealings with the Cuban and Soviet Embassies.<a id="FNanchor_C6-621" href="#Footnote_C6-621" class="fnanchor">C6-621</a>
When registering at the Beckley Avenue house in mid-October, Oswald
perpetuated the pseudonym by giving his name as “O. H. Lee,”<a id="FNanchor_C6-622" href="#Footnote_C6-622" class="fnanchor">C6-622</a>
though he had given his correct name to the owner of the previous
roominghouse where he had rented a room after his return from
Mexico City.<a id="FNanchor_C6-623" href="#Footnote_C6-623" class="fnanchor">C6-623</a> Investigations of the Commission have been conducted
with regard to persons using the name “Lee,” and no evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
has been found that Oswald used this alias for the purpose of making
any type of secret contacts.</p>

<p>Oswald is also known to have used the surname “Osborne” in ordering
Fair Play for Cuba Committee handbills in May 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-624" href="#Footnote_C6-624" class="fnanchor">C6-624</a> He also
used the false name D. F. Drittal as a certifying witness on the mail-order
coupon with which he purchased his Smith &amp; Wesson revolver.<a id="FNanchor_C6-625" href="#Footnote_C6-625" class="fnanchor">C6-625</a>
He used the name Lt. J. Evans as a reference on an employment application
in New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_C6-626" href="#Footnote_C6-626" class="fnanchor">C6-626</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s repeated use of false names is probably not to be disassociated
from his antisocial and criminal inclinations. No doubt he
purchased his weapons under the name of Hidell in attempt to prevent
their ownership from being traced. Oswald’s creation of false names
and ficititious personalities is treated in the discussion of possible
motives set forth in chapter VII. Whatever its significance in that
respect may be, the Commission has found no indication that Oswald’s
use of aliases was linked with any conspiracy with others.</p>

<p><i>Ownership of a second rifle.</i>—The Commission has investigated a
report that, during the first 2 weeks of November 1963, Oswald had
a telescopic sight mounted and sighted on a rifle at a sporting goods
store in Irving, Tex. The main evidence that Oswald had such work
performed for him is an undated repair tag bearing the name “Oswald”
from the Irving Sports Shop in Irving, Tex. On November 25,
1963, Dial D. Ryder, an employee of the Irving Sports Shop, presented
this tag to agents of the FBI, claiming that the tag was in his handwriting.
The undated tag indicated that three holes had been drilled
in an unspecified type of rifle and a telescopic sight had been mounted
on the rifle and boresighted.<a id="FNanchor_C6-627" href="#Footnote_C6-627" class="fnanchor">C6-627</a></p>

<p>As discussed in chapter IV, the telescopic sight on the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle was already mounted when shipped to Oswald,
and both Ryder and his employer, Charles W. Greener, feel certain
that they never did any work on this rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C6-628" href="#Footnote_C6-628" class="fnanchor">C6-628</a> If the repair tag
actually represented a transaction involving Lee Harvey Oswald,
therefore, it would mean that Oswald owned another rifle. Although
this would not alter the evidence which establishes Oswald’s ownership
of the rifle used to assassinate President Kennedy, the possession
of a second rifle warranted investigation because it would indicate that
a possibly important part of Oswald’s life had not been uncovered.</p>

<p>Since all of Oswald’s known transactions in connection with firearms
after his return to the United States were undertaken under an
assumed name,<a id="FNanchor_C6-629" href="#Footnote_C6-629" class="fnanchor">C6-629</a> it seems unlikely that if he did have repairs made at
the sports shop he would have used his real name. Investigation has
revealed that the authenticity of the repair tag bearing Oswald’s name
is indeed subject to grave doubts. Ryder testified that he found the
repair tag while cleaning his workbench on November 23, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-630" href="#Footnote_C6-630" class="fnanchor">C6-630</a>
However, Ryder spoke with Greener repeatedly during the period between
November 22-28 and, sometime prior to November 25, he discussed
with him the possibility that Oswald had been in the store.
Neither he nor Greener could remember that he had been. But despite
these conversations with Greener, it is significant that Ryder never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
called the repair tag to his employer’s attention. Greener did not learn
about the tag until November 28, when he was called by TV reporters
after the story had appeared in the Dallas Times-Herald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-631" href="#Footnote_C6-631" class="fnanchor">C6-631</a> The peculiarity
of Ryder’s silence is compounded by the fact that, when speaking
to the FBI on November 25, Ryder fixed the period during which
the tag had been issued as November 1-14, 1963, yet, from his later testimony,
it appears that he did so on the basis that it must have occurred
when Greener was on vacation since Greener did not remember the
transaction.<a id="FNanchor_C6-632" href="#Footnote_C6-632" class="fnanchor">C6-632</a> Moreover, the FBI had been directed to the Irving
Sports Shop by anonymous telephone calls received by its Dallas office
and by a local television station. The anonymous male who telephoned
the Bureau attributed his information to an unidentified sack boy at a
specified supermarket in Irving, but investigation has failed to verify
this source.<a id="FNanchor_C6-633" href="#Footnote_C6-633" class="fnanchor">C6-633</a></p>

<p>Neither Ryder nor Greener claimed that Lee Harvey Oswald
had ever been a customer in the Irving Sports Shop. Neither has
any recollection of either Oswald or his Mannlicher-Carcano rifle,
nor does either recall the transaction allegedly represented by the
repair tag or the person for whom the repair was supposedly made.<a id="FNanchor_C6-634" href="#Footnote_C6-634" class="fnanchor">C6-634</a>
Although Ryder stated to the FBI that he was “quite sure” that he
had seen Oswald and that Oswald may have been in the store at one
time, when shown a photograph of Oswald during his deposition,
Ryder testified he knew the picture to be of Oswald, “as the pictures
in the paper, but as far as seeing the guy personally, I don’t think I
ever have.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-635" href="#Footnote_C6-635" class="fnanchor">C6-635</a></p>

<p>Subsequent events also reflect on Ryder’s credibility. In his deposition,
Ryder emphatically denied that he talked to any reporters about
this matter prior to the time a story about it appeared in the November
28, 1963, edition of the Dallas Times-Herald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-636" href="#Footnote_C6-636" class="fnanchor">C6-636</a> Earlier, however,
he told an agent of the U.S. Secret Service that the newspaper had
misquoted him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-637" href="#Footnote_C6-637" class="fnanchor">C6-637</a> Moreover, a reporter for the Dallas Times-Herald
has testified that on November 28, 1963, he called Ryder at his home
and obtained from him all of the details of the alleged transaction,
and his story is supported by the testimony of a second reporter who
overheard one end of the telephone conversation.<a id="FNanchor_C6-638" href="#Footnote_C6-638" class="fnanchor">C6-638</a> No other person
by the name of Oswald in the Dallas-Fort Worth area has been found
who had a rifle repaired at the Irving Sports Shop.<a id="FNanchor_C6-639" href="#Footnote_C6-639" class="fnanchor">C6-639</a></p>

<p>Possible corroboration for Ryder’s story is provided by two women,
Mrs. Edith Whitworth, who operates the Furniture Mart, a furniture
store located about 1½ blocks from the Irving Sports Shop, and Mrs.
Gertrude Hunter, a friend of Mrs. Whitworth. They testified that
in early November of 1963, a man who they later came to believe was
Oswald drove up to the Furniture Mart in a two-tone blue and white
1957 Ford automobile, entered the store and asked about a part for
a gun, presumably because of a sign that appeared in the building advertising
a gunsmith shop that had formerly occupied part of the
premises. When he found that he could not obtain the part, the man
allegedly returned to his car and then came back into the store with
a woman and two young children to look at furniture, remaining in
the store for about 30 to 40 minutes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-640" href="#Footnote_C6-640" class="fnanchor">C6-640</a></p>

<p>Upon confronting Marina Oswald, both women identified her as the
woman whom they had seen in the store on the occasion in question,
although Mrs. Hunter could not identify a picture of Lee Harvey
Oswald and Mrs. Whitworth identified some pictures of Oswald but
not others. Mrs. Hunter purported to identify Marina Oswald by her
eyes, and did not observe the fact that Marina Oswald had a front
tooth missing at the time she supposedly saw her.<a id="FNanchor_C6-641" href="#Footnote_C6-641" class="fnanchor">C6-641</a> After a thorough
inspection of the Furniture Mart, Marina Oswald testified that she
had never been on the premises before.<a id="FNanchor_C6-642" href="#Footnote_C6-642" class="fnanchor">C6-642</a></p>

<p>The circumstances surrounding the testimony of the two women
are helpful in evaluating the weight to be given to their testimony,
and the extent to which they lend support to Ryder’s evidence. The
women previously told newspaper reporters that the part for which
the man was looking was a “plunger,” which the Commission has
been advised is a colloquial term used to describe a firing pin.<a id="FNanchor_C6-643" href="#Footnote_C6-643" class="fnanchor">C6-643</a>
This work was completely different from the work covered by Ryder’s
repair tag, and the firing pin of the assassination weapon does not appear
to have been recently replaced.<a id="FNanchor_C6-644" href="#Footnote_C6-644" class="fnanchor">C6-644</a> At the time of their depositions,
neither woman was able to recall the type of work which the
man wanted done.<a id="FNanchor_C6-645" href="#Footnote_C6-645" class="fnanchor">C6-645</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Whitworth related to the FBI that the man told her that the
younger child with him was born on October 20, 1963, which was in
fact Rachel Oswald’s birthday.<a id="FNanchor_C6-646" href="#Footnote_C6-646" class="fnanchor">C6-646</a> In her testimony before the Commission,
however, Mrs. Whitworth could not state that the man had
told her the child’s birthdate was October 20, 1963, and in fact expressed
uncertainty about the birthday of her own grandchild, which
she had previously used as a guide to remembering the birthdate of
the younger child in the shop.<a id="FNanchor_C6-647" href="#Footnote_C6-647" class="fnanchor">C6-647</a> Mrs. Hunter thought that the man
she and Mrs. Whitworth believed was Oswald drove the car to and
from the store;<a id="FNanchor_C6-648" href="#Footnote_C6-648" class="fnanchor">C6-648</a> however, Lee Harvey Oswald apparently was not
able to drive an automobile by himself and does not appear to have had
access to a car.<a id="FNanchor_C6-649" href="#Footnote_C6-649" class="fnanchor">C6-649</a></p>

<p>The two women claimed that Oswald was in the Furniture Mart on a
weekday, and in midafternoon. However, Oswald had reported to
work at the Texas School Book Depository on the dates referred to by
the women and there is no evidence that he left his job during business
hours.<a id="FNanchor_C6-650" href="#Footnote_C6-650" class="fnanchor">C6-650</a> In addition, Ruth Paine has stated that she always accompanied
Marina Oswald whenever Marina left the house with her children
and that they never went to the Furniture Mart, either with or
without Lee Harvey Oswald, at any time during October or November
of 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-651" href="#Footnote_C6-651" class="fnanchor">C6-651</a> There is nothing to indicate that in November the Oswalds
were interested in buying furniture.<a id="FNanchor_C6-652" href="#Footnote_C6-652" class="fnanchor">C6-652</a></p>

<p>Finally, investigation has produced reason to question the credibility
of Mrs. Hunter as a witness. Mrs. Hunter stated that one
of the reasons she remembers the description of the car in which Oswald
supposedly drove to the furniture store was that she was awaiting
the arrival of a friend from Houston, who drove a similar automobile.<a id="FNanchor_C6-653" href="#Footnote_C6-653" class="fnanchor">C6-653</a>
However, the friend in Houston has advised that in November
1963, she never visited or planned to visit Dallas, and that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
told no one that she intended to make such a trip. Moreover the
friend added, according to the FBI interview report, that Mrs. Hunter
has “a strange obsession for attempting to inject herself into any big
event which comes to her attention” and that she “is likely to claim
some personal knowledge of any major crime which receives much publicity.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-654" href="#Footnote_C6-654" class="fnanchor">C6-654</a>
She concluded that “the entire family is aware of these
‘tall tales’ Mrs. Hunter tells and they normally pay no attention to
her.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-655" href="#Footnote_C6-655" class="fnanchor">C6-655</a></p>

<p>Another allegation relating to the possible ownership of a second
rifle by Oswald comes from Robert Adrian Taylor, a mechanic at a
service station in Irving. Some 3 weeks after the assassination, Taylor
reported to the FBI that he thought that, in March or April of
1963, a man he believed to be Oswald had been a passenger in an automobile
that stopped at his station for repairs; since neither the driver
nor the passenger had sufficient funds for the repair work, the person
believed to be Oswald sold a U.S. Army rifle to Mr. Taylor, using
the proceeds to pay for the repairs.<a id="FNanchor_C6-656" href="#Footnote_C6-656" class="fnanchor">C6-656</a> However, a second employee
at the service station, who recalled the incident, believed that, despite
a slight resemblance, the passenger was not Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-657" href="#Footnote_C6-657" class="fnanchor">C6-657</a> Upon reflection,
Taylor himself stated that he is very doubtful that the man was
Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-658" href="#Footnote_C6-658" class="fnanchor">C6-658</a></p>

<p><i>Rifle practice.</i>—Several witnesses believed that in the weeks preceding
the assassination, they observed a man resembling Oswald practicing
with a rifle in the fields and wooded areas surrounding Dallas,
and at rifle ranges in that area. Some witnesses claimed Oswald was
alone, while others said he was accompanied by one or more other
persons. In most instances, investigation has disclosed that there
is no substantial basis for believing that the person reported by the
various witnesses was Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-659" href="#Footnote_C6-659" class="fnanchor">C6-659</a></p>

<p>One group of witnesses, however, believed that they observed Lee
Harvey Oswald at the Sports Drome Rifle Range in Dallas at various
times from September through November of 1963. In light of
the number of witnesses, the similarity of the descriptions of the
man they saw, and the type of weapon they thought the individual was
shooting, there is reason to believe that these witnesses did see the
same person at the firing range, although the testimony of none of
these witnesses is fully consistent with the reported observations of
the other witnesses.</p>

<p>The witnesses who claimed to have seen Oswald at the firing range
had more than a passing notice of the person they observed. Malcolm
H. Price, Jr., adjusted the scope on the individual’s rifle on one
occasion;<a id="FNanchor_C6-660" href="#Footnote_C6-660" class="fnanchor">C6-660</a> Garland G. Slack had an altercation with the individual
on another occasion because he was shooting at Slack’s target;<a id="FNanchor_C6-661" href="#Footnote_C6-661" class="fnanchor">C6-661</a>
and Sterling C. Wood, who on a third date was present at the range
with his father, Dr. Homer Wood, spoke with his father and very
briefly with the man himself about the individual’s rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C6-662" href="#Footnote_C6-662" class="fnanchor">C6-662</a> All three
of these persons, as well as Dr. Wood, expressed confidence that the
man they saw was Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-663" href="#Footnote_C6-663" class="fnanchor">C6-663</a> Two other persons believed they saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
a person resembling Oswald firing a similar rifle at another range
near Irving 2 days before the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-664" href="#Footnote_C6-664" class="fnanchor">C6-664</a></p>

<p>Although the testimony of these witnesses was partially corroborated
by other witnesses,<a id="FNanchor_C6-665" href="#Footnote_C6-665" class="fnanchor">C6-665</a> there was other evidence which prevented the
Commission from reaching the conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald was
the person these witnesses saw. Others who were at the firing range
remembered the same individual but, though noting a similarity to
Oswald, did not believe that the man was Oswald;<a id="FNanchor_C6-666" href="#Footnote_C6-666" class="fnanchor">C6-666</a> others either
were unable to state whether the man was Oswald or did not recall seeing
anybody who they feel may have been Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-667" href="#Footnote_C6-667" class="fnanchor">C6-667</a> Moreover, when
interviewed on December 2, 1963, Slack recalled that the individual
whom he saw had blond hair,<a id="FNanchor_C6-668" href="#Footnote_C6-668" class="fnanchor">C6-668</a> and on December 3, 1963, Price
stated that on several occasions when he saw the individual, he was
wearing a “Bulldogger Texas style” hat and had bubble gum or chewing
tobacco in his cheek.<a id="FNanchor_C6-669" href="#Footnote_C6-669" class="fnanchor">C6-669</a> None of these characteristics match those
known about Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Moreover, the date on which Price adjusted the scope for the
unknown person was September 28, 1963, but Oswald is known to
have been in Mexico City at that time;<a id="FNanchor_C6-670" href="#Footnote_C6-670" class="fnanchor">C6-670</a> since a comparison of the
events testified to by Price and Slack strongly suggests that they were
describing the same man,<a id="FNanchor_C6-671" href="#Footnote_C6-671" class="fnanchor">C6-671</a> there is reason to believe that Slack was
also describing a man other than Oswald. In addition, Slack believed
he saw the same person at the rifle range on November 10<a id="FNanchor_C6-672" href="#Footnote_C6-672" class="fnanchor">C6-672</a> and there
is persuasive evidence that on November 10, Oswald was at the Paine’s
home in Irving and did not leave to go to the rifle range.<a id="FNanchor_C6-673" href="#Footnote_C6-673" class="fnanchor">C6-673</a> Finally,
the man whom Price assisted on September 28 drove an old car, possibly
a 1940 or 1941 Ford.<a id="FNanchor_C6-674" href="#Footnote_C6-674" class="fnanchor">C6-674</a> However, there is evidence that Oswald could
not drive at that time, and there is no indication that Oswald ever had
access to such a car.<a id="FNanchor_C6-675" href="#Footnote_C6-675" class="fnanchor">C6-675</a> Neither Oswald’s name nor any of his known
aliases was found in the sign-in register maintained at the Sports
Drome Rifle Range, though many customers did not sign this
register.<a id="FNanchor_C6-676" href="#Footnote_C6-676" class="fnanchor">C6-676</a> The allegations pertaining to the companions who reportedly
accompanied the man believed to be Oswald are also inconsistent
among themselves<a id="FNanchor_C6-677" href="#Footnote_C6-677" class="fnanchor">C6-677</a> and conform to no other credible information
ascertained by the Commission. Several witnesses noticed a
bearded man at the club when the person believed to be Oswald was
there, although only one witness thought the two men were together;<a id="FNanchor_C6-678" href="#Footnote_C6-678" class="fnanchor">C6-678</a>
the bearded gentleman was located, and he was not found to have any
connection with Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-679" href="#Footnote_C6-679" class="fnanchor">C6-679</a></p>

<p>It seems likely that the identification of Price, Slack, and the Woods
was reinforced in their own minds by the belief that the man whom
they saw was firing a rifle perhaps identical to Oswald’s Mannlicher-Carcano.
The witnesses agreed that the man they observed was firing
a Mauser-type bolt-action rifle with the ammunition clip immediately
in front of the trigger action, and that a scope was mounted on the
rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C6-680" href="#Footnote_C6-680" class="fnanchor">C6-680</a> These features are consistent with the rifle Oswald used for
the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-681" href="#Footnote_C6-681" class="fnanchor">C6-681</a> The witnesses agreed that the man had accurate
aim with the rifle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-682" href="#Footnote_C6-682" class="fnanchor">C6-682</a></p>

<p>However, the evidence demonstrated that the weapon fired by the
man they observed was different from the assassination rifle. The
witnesses agreed that the barrel of the gun which the individual was
firing had been shortened in the process of “sporterizing” the
weapon.<a id="FNanchor_C6-683" href="#Footnote_C6-683" class="fnanchor">C6-683</a> In addition, Price and Slack recalled that certain pieces
were missing from the top of the weapon,<a id="FNanchor_C6-684" href="#Footnote_C6-684" class="fnanchor">C6-684</a> and Dr. Wood and his
son, and others, remembered that the weapon spouted flames when
fired.<a id="FNanchor_C6-685" href="#Footnote_C6-685" class="fnanchor">C6-685</a> None of these characteristics correspond with Oswald’s
Mannlicher-Carcano.<a id="FNanchor_C6-686" href="#Footnote_C6-686" class="fnanchor">C6-686</a> Price and Slack believed that the gun did not
have a sling, but the assassination weapon did have one. Sterling
Wood, on the other hand, recalled that the rifle which he saw had a
sling.<a id="FNanchor_C6-687" href="#Footnote_C6-687" class="fnanchor">C6-687</a> Price also recalled that he examined the rifle briefly for some
indication as to where it had been manufactured, but saw nothing,
whereas the words “MADE ITALY” are marked on the top of
Oswald’s Mannlicher-Carcano.<a id="FNanchor_C6-688" href="#Footnote_C6-688" class="fnanchor">C6-688</a></p>

<p>The scope on the rifle observed at the firing range does not appear
to be the same as the one on the assassination weapon. Price remembered
that the individual told him that his scope was Japanese, that
he had paid $18 for it, and that he had it mounted in a gunshop in
Cedar Hills, though apparently no such shop exists in that area.<a id="FNanchor_C6-689" href="#Footnote_C6-689" class="fnanchor">C6-689</a>
The scope on the Mannlicher-Carcano was of Japanese origin but it was
worth a little more than $7 and was already mounted when he received
the rifle from a mail-order firm in Chicago.<a id="FNanchor_C6-690" href="#Footnote_C6-690" class="fnanchor">C6-690</a> Sterling Wood
and Slack agreed that the scope had a somewhat different appearance
from the scope on the assassination rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C6-691" href="#Footnote_C6-691" class="fnanchor">C6-691</a></p>

<p>Though the person believed to be Oswald retained his shell casings,
presumably for reuse,<a id="FNanchor_C6-692" href="#Footnote_C6-692" class="fnanchor">C6-692</a> all casings recovered from areas where it is
believed that Oswald may have practiced have been examined by the
FBI Laboratory, and none has been found which was fired from
Oswald’s rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C6-693" href="#Footnote_C6-693" class="fnanchor">C6-693</a> Finally, evidence discussed in chapter IV tends to
prove that Oswald brought his rifle to Dallas from the home of the
Paines in Irving on November 22, and there is no other evidence which
indicates that he took the rifle or a package which might have contained
the rifle out of the Paine’s garage, where it was stored, prior
to that date.<a id="FNanchor_C6-694" href="#Footnote_C6-694" class="fnanchor">C6-694</a></p>

<p><i>Automobile demonstration.</i>—The testimony of Albert Guy Bogard
has been carefully evaluated because it suggests the possibility that
Oswald might have been a proficient automobile driver and, during
November 1963, might have been expecting funds with which to purchase
a car. Bogard, formerly an automobile salesman with a Lincoln-Mercury
firm in Dallas, testified that in the early afternoon of
November 9, 1963, he attended a prospective customer who he believes
was Lee Harvey Oswald. According to Bogard, the customer, after
test driving an automobile over the Stemmons Freeway at 60 to 70
miles per hour, told Bogard that in several weeks he would have the
money to make a purchase. Bogard asserted that the customer gave
his name as “Lee Oswald,” which Bogard wrote on a business card.
After Oswald’s name was mentioned on the radio on November 22,
Bogard assertedly threw the card in a trash can, making the comment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
to coemployees that he supposed Oswald would no longer wish to buy
a car.<a id="FNanchor_C6-695" href="#Footnote_C6-695" class="fnanchor">C6-695</a></p>

<p>Bogard’s testimony has received corroboration.<a id="FNanchor_C6-696" href="#Footnote_C6-696" class="fnanchor">C6-696</a> The assistant
sales manager at the time, Frank Pizzo, and a second salesman, Eugene
M. Wilson, stated that they recall an instance when the customer described
by Bogard was in the showroom.<a id="FNanchor_C6-697" href="#Footnote_C6-697" class="fnanchor">C6-697</a> Another salesman, Oran
Brown, recalled that Bogard asked him to assist the customer if he
appeared during certain evenings when Bogard was away from the
showroom. Brown stated that he too wrote down the customer’s name
and both he and his wife remember the name “Oswald” as being on a
paper in his possession before the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-698" href="#Footnote_C6-698" class="fnanchor">C6-698</a></p>

<p>However, doubts exist about the accuracy of Bogard’s testimony.
He, Pizzo, and Wilson differed on important details of what is supposed
to have occurred when the customer was in the showroom.
Whereas Bogard stated that the customer said he did not wish credit
and wanted to purchase a car for cash,<a id="FNanchor_C6-699" href="#Footnote_C6-699" class="fnanchor">C6-699</a> Pizzo and Wilson both indicated
that the man did attempt to purchase on credit.<a id="FNanchor_C6-700" href="#Footnote_C6-700" class="fnanchor">C6-700</a> According to
Wilson, when the customer was told that he would be unable to purchase
a car without a credit rating, substantial cash or a lengthy employment
record, he stated sarcastically, “Maybe I’m going to have to
go back to Russia to buy a car.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-701" href="#Footnote_C6-701" class="fnanchor">C6-701</a> While it is possible that Oswald
would have made such a remark, the statement is not consistent with
Bogard’s story. Indeed, Bogard has made no mention that the customer
ever spoke with Wilson while he was in the showroom.<a id="FNanchor_C6-702" href="#Footnote_C6-702" class="fnanchor">C6-702</a> More
important, on November 23, a search through the showroom’s refuse
was made, but no paper bearing Oswald’s name was found.<a id="FNanchor_C6-703" href="#Footnote_C6-703" class="fnanchor">C6-703</a> The
paper on which Brown reportedly wrote Oswald’s name also has never
been located.<a id="FNanchor_C6-704" href="#Footnote_C6-704" class="fnanchor">C6-704</a></p>

<p>The assistant sales manager, Mr. Pizzo, who saw Bogard’s prospect
on November 9 and shortly after the assassination felt that Oswald
may have been this man, later examined pictures of Oswald and expressed
serious doubts that the person with Bogard was in fact
Oswald. While noting a resemblance, he did not believe that Oswald’s
hairline matched that of the person who had been in the showroom on
November 9.<a id="FNanchor_C6-705" href="#Footnote_C6-705" class="fnanchor">C6-705</a> Wilson has stated that Bogard’s customer was only
about 5 feet tall.<a id="FNanchor_C6-706" href="#Footnote_C6-706" class="fnanchor">C6-706</a> Several persons who knew Oswald have testified
that he was unable to drive,<a id="FNanchor_C6-707" href="#Footnote_C6-707" class="fnanchor">C6-707</a> although Mrs. Paine, who was
giving Oswald driving lessons, stated that Oswald was showing some
improvement by November.<a id="FNanchor_C6-708" href="#Footnote_C6-708" class="fnanchor">C6-708</a> Moreover, Oswald’s whereabouts on
November 9, as testified to by Marina Oswald and Ruth Paine, would
have made it impossible for him to have visited the automobile showroom
as Mr. Bogard claims.<a id="FNanchor_C6-709" href="#Footnote_C6-709" class="fnanchor">C6-709</a></p>

<p><i>Alleged association with various Mexican or Cuban individuals.</i>—The
Commission has examined Oswald’s known or alleged contacts
and activities in an effort to ascertain whether or not he was involved
in any conspiracy may be seen in the investigation it conducted
as a result of the testimony given by Mrs. Sylvia Odio. The Commission
investigated her statements in connection with its consideration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
of the testimony of several witnesses suggesting that Oswald
may have been seen in the company of unidentified persons of
Cuban or Mexican background. Mrs. Odio was born in Havana in
1937 and remained in Cuba until 1960; it appears that both
of her parents are political prisoners of the Castro regime. Mrs.
Odio is a member of the Cuban Revolutionary Junta (JURE), an
anti-Castro organization.<a id="FNanchor_C6-710" href="#Footnote_C6-710" class="fnanchor">C6-710</a> She testified that late in September
1963, three men came to her apartment in Dallas and asked
her to help them prepare a letter soliciting funds for JURE activities.
She claimed that the men, who exhibited personal familiarity with
her imprisoned father, asked her if she were “working in the underground,”
and she replied that she was not.<a id="FNanchor_C6-711" href="#Footnote_C6-711" class="fnanchor">C6-711</a> She testified that two
of the men appeared to be Cubans, although they also had some characteristics
that she associated with Mexicans. Those two men did not
state their full names, but identified themselves only by their fictitious
underground “war names.” Mrs. Odio remembered the name of one of
the Cubans as “Leopoldo.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-712" href="#Footnote_C6-712" class="fnanchor">C6-712</a> The third man, an American, allegedly
was introduced to Mrs. Odio as “Leon Oswald,” and she was told that
he was very much interested in the Cuban cause.<a id="FNanchor_C6-713" href="#Footnote_C6-713" class="fnanchor">C6-713</a> Mrs. Odio said
that the men told her that they had just come from New Orleans and
that they were then about to leave on a trip.<a id="FNanchor_C6-714" href="#Footnote_C6-714" class="fnanchor">C6-714</a> Mrs. Odio testified
that the next day Leopoldo called her on the telephone and told her
that it was his idea to introduce the American into the underground
“because he is great, he is kind of nuts.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-715" href="#Footnote_C6-715" class="fnanchor">C6-715</a> Leopoldo also said that the
American had been in the Marine Corps and was an excellent shot, and
that the American said the Cubans “don’t have any guts * * * because
President Kennedy should have been assassinated after the Bay
of Pigs, and some Cubans should have done that, because he was the
one that was holding the freedom of Cuba actually.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-716" href="#Footnote_C6-716" class="fnanchor">C6-716</a></p>

<p>Although Mrs. Odio suggested doubts that the men were in fact
members of JURE,<a id="FNanchor_C6-717" href="#Footnote_C6-717" class="fnanchor">C6-717</a> she was certain that the American who was introduced
to her as Leon Oswald was Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-718" href="#Footnote_C6-718" class="fnanchor">C6-718</a> Her sister,
who was in the apartment at the time of the visit by the three men, and
who stated that she saw them briefly in the hallway when answering
the door, also believed that the American was Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-719" href="#Footnote_C6-719" class="fnanchor">C6-719</a>
By referring to the date on which she moved from her former apartment,
October 1, 1963, Mrs. Odio fixed the date of the alleged visit
on the Thursday or Friday immediately preceding that date, i.e.,
September 26 or 27. She was positive that the visit occurred prior to
October 1.<a id="FNanchor_C6-720" href="#Footnote_C6-720" class="fnanchor">C6-720</a></p>

<p>During the course of its investigation, however, the Commission
concluded that Oswald could not have been in Dallas on the evening
of either September 26 or 27, 1963. It also developed considerable
evidence that he was not in Dallas at any time between the beginning
of September and October 3, 1963. On April 24, Oswald left Dallas
for New Orleans, where he lived until his trip to Mexico City in late
September and his subsequent return to Dallas. Oswald is known to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
have been in New Orleans as late as September 23, 1963, the date on
which Mrs. Paine and Marina Oswald left New Orleans for Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-721" href="#Footnote_C6-721" class="fnanchor">C6-721</a>
Sometime between 4 p.m. on September 24 and 1 p.m. on September
25, Oswald cashed an unemployment compensation check at a store
in New Orleans;<a id="FNanchor_C6-722" href="#Footnote_C6-722" class="fnanchor">C6-722</a> under normal procedures this check would not
have reached Oswald’s postal box in New Orleans until at least 5 a.m.
on September 25.<a id="FNanchor_C6-723" href="#Footnote_C6-723" class="fnanchor">C6-723</a> The store at which he cashed the check did not
open until 8 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-724" href="#Footnote_C6-724" class="fnanchor">C6-724</a> Therefore, it appeared that Oswald’s presence in
New Orleans until sometime between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. on September
25 was quite firmly established.</p>

<p>Although there is no firm evidence of the means by which Oswald
traveled from New Orleans to Houston, on the first leg of his Mexico
City trip, the Commission noted that a Continental Trailways bus leaving
New Orleans at 12:30 p.m. on September 25 would have brought
Oswald to Houston at 10:50 p.m. that evening.<a id="FNanchor_C6-725" href="#Footnote_C6-725" class="fnanchor">C6-725</a> His presence on this
bus would be consistent with other evidence before the Commission.<a id="FNanchor_C6-726" href="#Footnote_C6-726" class="fnanchor">C6-726</a>
There is strong evidence that on September 26, 1963, Oswald traveled
on Continental Trailways bus No. 5133 which left Houston
at 2:35 a.m. for Laredo, Tex. Bus company records disclose that
one ticket from Houston to Laredo was sold during the night shift
on September 25-26, and that such ticket was the only one of its
kind sold in the period of September 24 through September 26.
The agent who sold this ticket has stated that Oswald could have
been the purchaser.<a id="FNanchor_C6-727" href="#Footnote_C6-727" class="fnanchor">C6-727</a> Two English passengers, Dr. and Mrs. John
B. McFarland, testified that they saw Oswald riding alone on this
bus shortly after they awoke at 6 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-728" href="#Footnote_C6-728" class="fnanchor">C6-728</a> The bus was scheduled to
arrive in Laredo at 1:20 p.m. on September 26, and Mexican immigration
records show that Oswald in fact crossed the border at
Laredo to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. on that
day.<a id="FNanchor_C6-729" href="#Footnote_C6-729" class="fnanchor">C6-729</a> Evidence set out in appendix XIII establishes that Oswald
did not leave Mexico until October 3, and that he arrived in Dallas
the same day.</p>

<p>The Commission noted that the only time not strictly accounted for
during the period that Mrs. Odio thought Oswald might have visited
her is the span between the morning of September 25 and 2:35 a.m.
on September 26. The only public means of transportation by which
Oswald could have traveled from New Orleans to Dallas in time to
catch his bus from Houston to Laredo, would have been the airlines.
Investigation disclosed no indication that he flew between these
points.<a id="FNanchor_C6-730" href="#Footnote_C6-730" class="fnanchor">C6-730</a> Moreover, it did not seem probable that Oswald would
speed from New Orleans, spend a short time talking to Sylvia Odio,
and then travel from Dallas to Mexico City and back on the bus.
Automobile travel in the time available, though perhaps possible,
would have been difficult.<a id="FNanchor_C6-731" href="#Footnote_C6-731" class="fnanchor">C6-731</a> The Commission noted, however, that if
Oswald had reached Dallas on the evening of September 25, he could
have traveled by bus to Alice, Tex., and there caught the bus which
had left Houston for Laredo at 2:35 a.m. on September 26, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-732" href="#Footnote_C6-732" class="fnanchor">C6-732</a>
Further investigation in that regard indicated, however, that no tickets
were sold, during the period September 23-26, 1963 for travel from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
Dallas to Laredo or points beyond by the Dallas office of Continental
Trailways, the only bus line on which Oswald could have made connections
with the bus on which he was later seen. Furthermore, if
Oswald had traveled from Dallas to Alice, he would not have reached
the Houston to Laredo bus until after he was first reportedly observed
on it by the McFarlands.<a id="FNanchor_C6-733" href="#Footnote_C6-733" class="fnanchor">C6-733</a> Oswald had also told passengers on the
bus to Laredo that he had traveled from New Orleans by bus, and made
no mention of an intervening trip to Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-734" href="#Footnote_C6-734" class="fnanchor">C6-734</a> In addition, the Commission
noted evidence that on the evening of September 25, 1963,
Oswald made a telephone call to a party in Houston proposing to visit
a resident of Houston that evening<a id="FNanchor_C6-735" href="#Footnote_C6-735" class="fnanchor">C6-735</a> and the fact that such a call
would appear to be inconsistent with Oswald’s having been in Dallas
at the time. It thus appeared that the evidence was persuasive that
Oswald was not in Dallas on September 25, and, therefore, that he was
not in that city at the time Mrs. Odio said she saw him.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that it appeared almost certain that Oswald
could not have been in Dallas at the time Mrs. Odio thought he was,
the Commission requested the FBI to conduct further investigation
to determine the validity of Mrs. Odio’s testimony.<a id="FNanchor_C6-736" href="#Footnote_C6-736" class="fnanchor">C6-736</a> The Commission
considered the problems raised by that testimony as important
in view of the possibility it raised that Oswald may have
had companions on his trip to Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_C6-737" href="#Footnote_C6-737" class="fnanchor">C6-737</a> The Commission specifically
requested the FBI to attempt to locate and identify the two men who
Mrs. Odio stated were with the man she thought was Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-738" href="#Footnote_C6-738" class="fnanchor">C6-738</a>
In an effort to do that the FBI located and interviewed Manuel Ray,
a leader of JURE who confirmed that Mrs. Odio’s parents were
political prisoners in Cuba, but stated that he did not know anything
about the alleged Oswald visit.<a id="FNanchor_C6-739" href="#Footnote_C6-739" class="fnanchor">C6-739</a> The same was true of Rogelio
Cisneros,<a id="FNanchor_C6-740" href="#Footnote_C6-740" class="fnanchor">C6-740</a> a former anti-Castro leader from Miami who had visited
Mrs. Odio in June of 1962 in connection with certain anti-Castro
activities.<a id="FNanchor_C6-741" href="#Footnote_C6-741" class="fnanchor">C6-741</a> Additional investigation was conducted in Dallas and
in other cities in search of the visitors to Mrs. Odio’s apartment.<a id="FNanchor_C6-742" href="#Footnote_C6-742" class="fnanchor">C6-742</a>
Mrs. Odio herself was reinterviewed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-743" href="#Footnote_C6-743" class="fnanchor">C6-743</a></p>

<p>On September 16, 1964, the FBI located Loran Eugene Hall in
Johnsandale, Calif.<a id="FNanchor_C6-744" href="#Footnote_C6-744" class="fnanchor">C6-744</a> Hall has been identified as a participant in
numerous anti-Castro activities.<a id="FNanchor_C6-745" href="#Footnote_C6-745" class="fnanchor">C6-745</a> He told the FBI that in September
of 1963 he was in Dallas, soliciting aid in connection with anti-Castro
activities. He said he had visited Mrs. Odio. He was accompanied
by Lawrence Howard, a Mexican-American from East Los
Angeles and one William Seymour from Arizona. He stated that
Seymour is similar in appearance to Lee Harvey Oswald; he speaks
only a few words of Spanish,<a id="FNanchor_C6-746" href="#Footnote_C6-746" class="fnanchor">C6-746</a> as Mrs. Odio had testified one of the
men who visited her did.<a id="FNanchor_C6-747" href="#Footnote_C6-747" class="fnanchor">C6-747</a> While the FBI had not yet completed
its investigation into this matter at the time the report went to press,
the Commission has concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was not at
Mrs. Odio’s apartment in September of 1963.</p>

<p>The Commission has also noted the testimony of Evaristo Rodriguez,
a bartender in the Habana Bar in New Orleans, to the effect that
he saw Oswald in that bar in August of 1963 in the company of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
Latin-appearing man.<a id="FNanchor_C6-748" href="#Footnote_C6-748" class="fnanchor">C6-748</a> Rodriguez’ description of the man accompanying
the person he thought to be Oswald was similar in respects to
the description given by Sylvia Odio since both testified that the man
may have been of either Cuban or Mexican extraction, and had a slight
bald spot on the forepart of his hairline.<a id="FNanchor_C6-749" href="#Footnote_C6-749" class="fnanchor">C6-749</a> Rodriguez’ identification
of Oswald was uncorroborated except for the testimony of the owner
of the bar, Orest Pena; according to Rodriguez, Pena was not in a position
to observe the man he thought later to have been Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-750" href="#Footnote_C6-750" class="fnanchor">C6-750</a>
Although Pena has testified that he did observe the same person as
did Rodriguez, and that this person was Oswald,<a id="FNanchor_C6-751" href="#Footnote_C6-751" class="fnanchor">C6-751</a> an FBI interview
report indicated that a month earlier Pena had stated that he “could
not at this time or at any time say whether or not the person was identical
with Lee Harvey Oswald.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-752" href="#Footnote_C6-752" class="fnanchor">C6-752</a> Though when testifying, Pena
identified photographs of Oswald, the FBI report also recorded that
Pena “stated the only reason he was able to recognize Oswald was
because he had seen Oswald’s picture in the news media so often after
the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-753" href="#Footnote_C6-753" class="fnanchor">C6-753</a> When present
at Pena’s bar, Oswald was supposed to have been intoxicated to the
extent that he became ill,<a id="FNanchor_C6-754" href="#Footnote_C6-754" class="fnanchor">C6-754</a> which is inconsistent with other evidence
that Oswald did not drink alcoholic beverages to excess.<a id="FNanchor_C6-755" href="#Footnote_C6-755" class="fnanchor">C6-755</a></p>

<p>The Commission has also noted the testimony of Dean Andrews, an
attorney in New Orleans. Andrews stated that Oswald came to his
office several times in the summer of 1963 to seek advice on a less
than honorable discharge from the Armed Forces, the citizenship status
of his wife and his own citizenship status. Andrews, who believed
that he was contacted on November 23 to represent Oswald, testified
that Oswald was always accompanied by a Mexican and was at times
accompanied by apparent homosexuals.<a id="FNanchor_C6-756" href="#Footnote_C6-756" class="fnanchor">C6-756</a> Andrews was able to locate
no records of any of Oswald’s alleged visits, and investigation has
failed to locate the person who supposedly called Andrews on November
23, at a time when Andrews was under heavy sedation.<a id="FNanchor_C6-757" href="#Footnote_C6-757" class="fnanchor">C6-757</a> While
one of Andrews’ employees felt that Oswald might have been at his
office, his secretary has no recollection of Oswald being there.<a id="FNanchor_C6-758" href="#Footnote_C6-758" class="fnanchor">C6-758</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr132">Oswald Was Not an Agent for the U.S. Government</h4>

<p>From the time of his release from the Marine Corps until the assassination,
Lee Harvey Oswald dealt in various transactions with
several agencies of the U.S. Government. Before departing the
United States for the Soviet Union in 1959, he obtained an American
passport, which he returned to the Embassy in Moscow in October
1959 when he attempted to renounce his U.S. citizenship. Thereafter,
while in the Soviet Union, Oswald had numerous contacts with the
American Embassy, both in person and through correspondence. Two
years later, he applied for the return and renewal of his passport,
which was granted him. His application concerning the admittance
of his wife to this country was passed upon by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service of the Department of Justice in addition to
the State Department. And before returning to this country, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
secured a loan from the State Department to help cover his transportation
costs from Moscow to New York. These dealings with the Department
of State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service have
been reviewed earlier in this chapter and are considered in detail in
appendix XV. After his return, Oswald was interviewed on three
occasions by agents of the FBI, and Mrs. Paine was also questioned
by the FBI about Oswald’s activities. Oswald obtained a second
passport in June of 1963. And both the FBI and the CIA
took note of his Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities in New
Orleans and his appearance at the Soviet consulate in Mexico City.
For reasons which will be discussed fully in chapter VIII, Oswald’s
name was never given to the U.S. Secret Service.</p>

<p>These dealings have given rise to numerous rumors and allegations
that Oswald may have been a paid informant or some type of undercover
agent for a Federal agency, usually the FBI or the CIA. The
Commission has fully explored whether Oswald had any official or
unofficial relationship with any Federal agency beyond that already
described.</p>

<p>Oswald’s mother, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald, testified before the Commission
that she believes her son went to Russia and returned as an
undercover agent for the U.S. Government.<a id="FNanchor_C6-759" href="#Footnote_C6-759" class="fnanchor">C6-759</a> Mrs. Oswald mentioned
the belief that her son was an agent to a State Department
representative whom she visited in January 1961, when she was trying
to locate her son.<a id="FNanchor_C6-760" href="#Footnote_C6-760" class="fnanchor">C6-760</a> She had been interviewed earlier by FBI Agent
John W. Fain, within some 6 months of Oswald’s departure for Russia,
and did not at that time suggest such an explanation for Oswald’s
departure.<a id="FNanchor_C6-761" href="#Footnote_C6-761" class="fnanchor">C6-761</a> Though provided the opportunity to present any material
she considered pertinent, Mrs. Oswald was not able to give the
Commission any reasonable basis for her speculation.<a id="FNanchor_C6-762" href="#Footnote_C6-762" class="fnanchor">C6-762</a> As discussed
later in this chapter, the Commission has investigated Marguerite Oswald’s
claim that an FBI agent showed her a picture of Jack Ruby
after the assassination but before Lee Harvey Oswald had been killed;
this allegation was inaccurate, since the picture was not of Ruby.</p>

<p>After the assassination it was reported that in 1962 Oswald had told
Pauline Bates, a public stenographer in Fort Worth, Tex., that he
had become a “secret agent” of the U.S. Government and that he was
soon going back to Russia “for Washington.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-763" href="#Footnote_C6-763" class="fnanchor">C6-763</a> Mrs. Bates in her
sworn testimony denied that Oswald ever told her anything to that
effect.<a id="FNanchor_C6-764" href="#Footnote_C6-764" class="fnanchor">C6-764</a> She testified that she had stated “that when he first said that
he went to Russia and had gotten a visa that I thought—it was just a
thought—that maybe he was going over under the auspices of the State
Department—as a student or something.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-765" href="#Footnote_C6-765" class="fnanchor">C6-765</a></p>

<p>In order to evaluate the nature of Oswald’s dealings with the Department
of State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
the Commission has obtained the complete files of both the Department
and the Service pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald. Officials who were
directly involved in dealing with the Oswald case on these matters
have testified before the Commission. A critical evaluation of the
manner in which they were handled by these organizations is set forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
in appendix XV. The record establishes that Oswald received no
preferential treatment and that his case involved no impropriety on
the part of any Government official.</p>

<p>Director John A. McCone and Deputy Director Richard Helms of
the Central Intelligence Agency testified before the Commission that
no one connected with the CIA had ever interviewed Oswald or communicated
with him in any way.<a id="FNanchor_C6-766" href="#Footnote_C6-766" class="fnanchor">C6-766</a> In his supplementing affidavit,
Director McCone stated unequivocally that Oswald was not an agent,
employee, or informant of the CIA, that the Agency never communicated
with him in any manner or furnished him any compensation,
and that Oswald was never directly or indirectly associated with the
CIA.<a id="FNanchor_C6-767" href="#Footnote_C6-767" class="fnanchor">C6-767</a> The Commission has had access to the full CIA file on Oswald
which is entirely consistent with Director McCone’s statements.</p>

<p>The Director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, Assistant to the Director
Alan H. Belmont, FBI Agents John W. Fain and John L.
Quigley, who interviewed Oswald, and FBI Agent James P. Hosty,
Jr., who was in charge of his case at the time of the assassination,
have also testified before the Commission. All declared, in substance,
that Oswald was not an informant or agent of the FBI, that he did not
act in any other capacity for the FBI, and that no attempt was made
to recruit him in any capacity.<a id="FNanchor_C6-768" href="#Footnote_C6-768" class="fnanchor">C6-768</a> Director Hoover and each Bureau
agent, who according to the FBI would have been responsible for or
aware of any attempt to recruit Oswald as an informant, have also
provided the Commission with sworn affidavits to this effect.<a id="FNanchor_C6-769" href="#Footnote_C6-769" class="fnanchor">C6-769</a> Director
Hoover has sworn that he caused a search to be made of the
records of the Bureau, and that the search discloses that Oswald “was
never an informant of the FBI, and never assigned a symbol number
in that capacity, and was never paid any amount of money by the
FBI in any regard.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-770" href="#Footnote_C6-770" class="fnanchor">C6-770</a> This testimony is corroborated by the Commission’s
independent review of the Bureau files dealing with the
Oswald investigation.</p>

<p>The Commission also investigated the circumstances which led to
the presence in Oswald’s address book of the name of Agent Hosty
together with his office address, telephone number, and license number.<a id="FNanchor_C6-771" href="#Footnote_C6-771" class="fnanchor">C6-771</a>
Hosty and Mrs. Paine testified that on November 1, 1963,
Hosty left his name and phone number with Mrs. Paine so that she
could advise Hosty when she learned where Oswald was living in
Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-772" href="#Footnote_C6-772" class="fnanchor">C6-772</a> Mrs. Paine and Marina Oswald have testified that Mrs.
Paine handed Oswald the slip of paper on which Hosty had written
this information.<a id="FNanchor_C6-773" href="#Footnote_C6-773" class="fnanchor">C6-773</a> In accordance with prior instructions from
Oswald,<a id="FNanchor_C6-774" href="#Footnote_C6-774" class="fnanchor">C6-774</a> Marina Oswald noted Hosty’s license number which she
gave to her husband.<a id="FNanchor_C6-775" href="#Footnote_C6-775" class="fnanchor">C6-775</a> The address of the Dallas office of the FBI
could have been obtained from many public sources.</p>

<p>Thus, close scrutiny of the records of the Federal agencies involved
and the testimony of the responsible officials of the U.S. Government
establish that there was absolutely no type of informant or undercover
relationship between an agency of the U.S. Government and Lee
Harvey Oswald at any time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<h4 id="hdr133">Oswald’s Finances</h4>

<p>In search of activities or payments demonstrating the receipt of unexplained
funds, the Commission undertook a detailed study of
Oswald’s receipts and expenditures starting with the date of his
return from the Soviet Union on June 13, 1962, and continuing to the
date of his arrest on November 22, 1963. In appendix XIV there
appears a table listing Oswald’s estimated receipts and expenditures
on a monthly basis during this period.</p>

<p>The Commission was assisted in this phase of the investigation by
able investigators of the Internal Revenue Service of the Department
of the Treasury and by agents of the FBI. The investigation extended
far beyond interrogation of witnesses who appeared before the Commission.
At banks in New Orleans, La.; Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston,
and Laredo, Tex., inquiries were made for any record of a checking,
savings, or loan accounts or a safe deposit box rented in the names of
Lee Harvey Oswald, his known aliases, or members of his immediate
family. In many cases a photograph of Oswald was exhibited to
bank officials who were in a position to see a person in the safe deposit
box area of their banks. No bank account or safe deposit boxes were
located which could be identified with Oswald during this period of
his life, although evidence was developed of a bank account which he
had used prior to his trip to the Soviet Union in 1959. Telegraph
companies were checked for the possibility of money orders that may
have been sent to Oswald. All known locations where Oswald cashed
checks which he received were queried as to the possibility of his having
cashed other checks there. Further inquiries were made at Oswald’s
places of employment, his residences and with local credit associations,
hospitals, utility companies, State and local government offices, post
offices, periodicals, newspapers, and employment agencies.<a id="FNanchor_C6-776" href="#Footnote_C6-776" class="fnanchor">C6-776</a></p>

<p>Marina Oswald testified that she knew of no sources of income
Oswald other than his wages and his unemployment compensation.<a id="FNanchor_C6-777" href="#Footnote_C6-777" class="fnanchor">C6-777</a>
No evidence of other cash income has been discovered.
The Commission has found that the funds known to have been available
to Oswald during the period June 13, 1962, through November 22,
1963, were sufficient to cover all of his known expenditures during this
period. Including cash on hand of $63 when he arrived from the
Soviet Union, the Oswalds received a total of $3,665.89 in cash from
wages, unemployment compensation benefits, loans, and gifts from
acquaintances. His cash disbursements during this period were estimated
at $3,501.79, leaving a balance of $164.10. (See <a href="#APPENDIX_XIV">app. XIV</a>.)
This estimated balance is within $19 of the $183.87 in cash which was
actually in Oswald’s possession at the time of his arrest, consisting
of $13.87 on his person and $170 in his wallet left at the Paine house.<a id="FNanchor_C6-778" href="#Footnote_C6-778" class="fnanchor">C6-778</a></p>

<p>In computing Oswald’s expenditures, estimates were made for food,
clothing, and incidental expenses. The incidental expenses included
telephone calls, the cost of local newspapers, money order and check-cashing
fees, postage, local transportation costs, personal care goods
and services, and other such small items. All of these expenses, including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
food and clothing, were estimated at a slightly higher figure
than would be normal for a family with the income of the Oswalds,
and probably higher than the Oswalds actually spent on such items.<a id="FNanchor_C6-779" href="#Footnote_C6-779" class="fnanchor">C6-779</a>
This was done in order to be certain that even if some of Oswald’s
minor expenditures are not known, he had adequate funds to cover
his known expenditures.</p>

<p>During the 17-month period preceding his death, Oswald’s pattern
of living was consistent with his limited income. He lived with his
family in furnished apartments whose cost, including utilities, ranged
from about $60 to $75 per month.<a id="FNanchor_C6-780" href="#Footnote_C6-780" class="fnanchor">C6-780</a> Witnesses testified to his wife’s
disappointment and complaints and to their own shock and misgivings
about several of the apartments in which the Oswalds lived
during the period.<a id="FNanchor_C6-781" href="#Footnote_C6-781" class="fnanchor">C6-781</a> Moreover, the Oswalds, particularly Marina,
frequently lived with relatives and acquaintances at no cost. Oswald
and his family lived with his brother Robert and then with Marguerite
Oswald from June until sometime in August 1962.<a id="FNanchor_C6-782" href="#Footnote_C6-782" class="fnanchor">C6-782</a> As discussed
previously, Marina Oswald lived with Elena Hall and spent a few
nights at the Taylors’ house during October of 1962;<a id="FNanchor_C6-783" href="#Footnote_C6-783" class="fnanchor">C6-783</a> in November
of that same year, Marina Oswald lived with two families.<a id="FNanchor_C6-784" href="#Footnote_C6-784" class="fnanchor">C6-784</a>
When living away from his family Oswald rented rooms for $7 and
$8 per week or stayed at the YMCA in Dallas where he paid $2.25
per day.<a id="FNanchor_C6-785" href="#Footnote_C6-785" class="fnanchor">C6-785</a> During late April and early May 1963, Oswald lived
with relatives in New Orleans, while his wife lived with Ruth Paine
in Irving, Tex.<a id="FNanchor_C6-786" href="#Footnote_C6-786" class="fnanchor">C6-786</a> From September 24, 1963, until November 22,
Marina Oswald stayed with Ruth Paine, while Oswald lived in roominghouses
in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-787" href="#Footnote_C6-787" class="fnanchor">C6-787</a> During the period Marina Oswald resided
with others, neither she nor her husband made any contribution to her
support.<a id="FNanchor_C6-788" href="#Footnote_C6-788" class="fnanchor">C6-788</a></p>

<p>The Oswalds owned no major household appliances, had no
automobile, and resorted to dental and hospital clinics for medical
care.<a id="FNanchor_C6-789" href="#Footnote_C6-789" class="fnanchor">C6-789</a> Acquaintances purchased baby furniture for them, and paid
dental bills in one instance.<a id="FNanchor_C6-790" href="#Footnote_C6-790" class="fnanchor">C6-790</a> After his return to the United States,
Oswald did not smoke or drink, and he discouraged his wife from
doing so.<a id="FNanchor_C6-791" href="#Footnote_C6-791" class="fnanchor">C6-791</a> Oswald spent much of his time reading books which he
obtained from the public library, and periodicals to which he subscribed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-792" href="#Footnote_C6-792" class="fnanchor">C6-792</a>
He resided near his place of employment and used buses
to travel to and from work.<a id="FNanchor_C6-793" href="#Footnote_C6-793" class="fnanchor">C6-793</a> When he visited his wife and the children
on weekends in October and November 1963, he rode in a neighbor’s
car, making no contribution for gasoline or other expenses.<a id="FNanchor_C6-794" href="#Footnote_C6-794" class="fnanchor">C6-794</a>
Oswald’s personal wardrobe was also very modest. He customarily
wore T-shirts, cheap slacks, well-worn sweaters, and well-used zipper
jackets. Oswald owned one suit, of Russian make and purchase, poor
fitting and of heavy fabric which, despite its unsuitability to the
climates of Texas and Louisiana and his obvious discomfort, he wore
on the few occasions that required dress.<a id="FNanchor_C6-795" href="#Footnote_C6-795" class="fnanchor">C6-795</a></p>

<p>Food for his family was extremely meager. Paul Gregory testified
that during the 6 weeks that Marina Oswald tutored him he took the
Oswalds shopping for food and groceries on a number of occasions
and that he was “amazed at how little they bought.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-796" href="#Footnote_C6-796" class="fnanchor">C6-796</a> Their friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
in the Dallas-Fort Worth area frequently brought them food and
groceries.<a id="FNanchor_C6-797" href="#Footnote_C6-797" class="fnanchor">C6-797</a> Marina testified that her husband ate “very little.” He
“never had breakfast. He just drank coffee and that is all. Not because
he was trying to economize. Simply he never liked to eat.”
She estimated that when he was living by himself in a roominghouse,
he would spend “about a dollar, $1.30” for dinner and have a sandwich
and soft drink for lunch.<a id="FNanchor_C6-798" href="#Footnote_C6-798" class="fnanchor">C6-798</a></p>

<p>The thrift which Oswald exercised in meeting his living expenses
allowed him to accumulate sufficient funds to meet other expenses
which he incurred after his return from the Soviet Union. From his
return until January of 1963, Oswald repaid the $435.71 he had borrowed
from the State Department for travel expenses from Moscow,
and the $200 loan he had obtained from his brother Robert to fly from
New York to Dallas upon his return to this country. He completed the
retirement of the debt to his brother in October 1962.<a id="FNanchor_C6-799" href="#Footnote_C6-799" class="fnanchor">C6-799</a> His cash
receipts from all sources from the day of his arrival in Fort Worth
through October 1962 aggregated $719.94; it is estimated that he
could have made the repayments to Robert and met his other known
expenses and still have been left with savings of $122.06 at the end
of the month. After making initial $10 monthly payments to the
State Department, Oswald paid the Government $190 in December
and $206 in January, thus liquidating that debt.<a id="FNanchor_C6-800" href="#Footnote_C6-800" class="fnanchor">C6-800</a> From his net
earning of $805.96 from November through January plus his prior
savings, Oswald could have made these payments to the State Department,
met his other known expenses, and still have had a balance
of $8.59 at the end of January 1963. In discussing the repayment
of these debts, Marina Oswald testified: “Of course we did not live
in luxury. We did not buy anything that was not absolutely needed,
because Lee had to pay his debt to Robert and to the Government.
But it was not particularly difficult.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-801" href="#Footnote_C6-801" class="fnanchor">C6-801</a></p>

<p>Included in the total figure for Oswald’s disbursements were $21.45
for the rifle used in the assassination and $31.22 for the revolver with
which Oswald shot Officer Tippit. The major portion of the purchase
price for these weapons was paid in March 1963, when Oswald had
finished paying his debts, and the purchases were compatible with
the total funds then available to him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-802" href="#Footnote_C6-802" class="fnanchor">C6-802</a> During May, June, and July
of 1963, Oswald spent approximately $23 for circulars, application
blanks, and membership cards for his one-man New Orleans chapter
of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.<a id="FNanchor_C6-803" href="#Footnote_C6-803" class="fnanchor">C6-803</a> In August he paid $2 to one
and possibly two young men to assist in passing out circulars and then
paid a $10 court fine after pleading guilty to a charge of disturbing
the peace.<a id="FNanchor_C6-804" href="#Footnote_C6-804" class="fnanchor">C6-804</a> Although some of these expenses were incurred after
Oswald lost his job on July 19, 1963, his wages during June and July,
and his unemployment compensation thereafter, provided sufficient
funds to enable him to finance these activities out of his own
resources.<a id="FNanchor_C6-805" href="#Footnote_C6-805" class="fnanchor">C6-805</a></p>

<p>Although Oswald paid his own busfare to New Orleans on April 24,
1963, his wife and the baby were taken there, at no cost to Oswald,
by Ruth Paine.<a id="FNanchor_C6-806" href="#Footnote_C6-806" class="fnanchor">C6-806</a> Similarly, Ruth Paine drove to New Orleans in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
September and brought Marina Oswald and the baby back to Irving,
Tex.<a id="FNanchor_C6-807" href="#Footnote_C6-807" class="fnanchor">C6-807</a> Oswald’s uncle, Charles Murret, also paid for the short trip
taken by Oswald and his family from New Orleans to Mobile, Ala., on
July 27, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-808" href="#Footnote_C6-808" class="fnanchor">C6-808</a> It is estimated that when Oswald left for Mexico
City in September 1963, he had accumulated slightly over $200.
Marina Oswald testified that when he left for Mexico City he had
“a little over $100,” though she may not have taken into account the
$33 unemployment compensation check which Oswald collected after
her departure from New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_C6-809" href="#Footnote_C6-809" class="fnanchor">C6-809</a> In any event, expenses in
Mexico have been estimated as approximately $85, based on transportation
costs of $50 and a hotel expense of about $1.28 per day.
Oswald ate inexpensively and, allowing $15 for entertainment and
miscellaneous items, it would appear that he had the funds available to
finance the trip.<a id="FNanchor_C6-810" href="#Footnote_C6-810" class="fnanchor">C6-810</a></p>

<p>The Commission has considered the testimony of Leonard E. Hutchison,
proprietor of Hutch’s Market in Irving, in connection with
Oswald’s finances. Hutchison has testified that on a Friday during
the first week in November, a man he believes to have been Lee Harvey
Oswald attempted to cash a “two-party,” or personal check for $189,
but that he refused to cash the check since his policy is to cash personal
checks for no more than $25.<a id="FNanchor_C6-811" href="#Footnote_C6-811" class="fnanchor">C6-811</a> Oswald is not known to have received
a check for this amount from any source.</p>

<p>On Friday, November 1, Oswald did cash a Texas Unemployment
Commission check for $33 at another supermarket in Irving,<a id="FNanchor_C6-812" href="#Footnote_C6-812" class="fnanchor">C6-812</a> so that
a possible explanation of Hutchison’s testimony is that he refused to
cash this $33 check for Oswald and is simply in error as to the amount
of the instrument. However, since the check cashed at the supermarket
was issued by the State comptroller of Texas, it is not likely
that Hutchison could have confused it with a personal check.</p>

<p>Examination of Hutchison’s testimony indicates that a more likely
explanation is that Oswald was not in his store at all. Hutchison
testified that the man who attempted to cash the check was a customer
in his store on previous occasions; in particular, Hutchison recalled
that the man, accompanied by a woman he believes was Marina
Oswald and an elderly woman, were shopping in his store in October
or November of 1963 on a night he feels certain was a Wednesday
evening.<a id="FNanchor_C6-813" href="#Footnote_C6-813" class="fnanchor">C6-813</a> Oswald, however, is not known to have been in Irving
on any Wednesday evening during this period.<a id="FNanchor_C6-814" href="#Footnote_C6-814" class="fnanchor">C6-814</a> Neither of the two
checkers at the market recall such a visit by a person matching the
description provided by Hutchison, and both Marina Oswald and
Marguerite Oswald deny that they were ever in Hutchison’s store.<a id="FNanchor_C6-815" href="#Footnote_C6-815" class="fnanchor">C6-815</a>
Hutchison further stated that the man made irregular calls at his
grocery between 7:20 a.m. and 7:45 a.m. on weekday mornings, and
always purchased cinnamon rolls and a full gallon of milk.<a id="FNanchor_C6-816" href="#Footnote_C6-816" class="fnanchor">C6-816</a> However,
the evidence indicates that except for rare occasions Oswald
was in Irving only on weekends; moreover, Buell Wesley Frazier,
who drove Oswald to and from Irving on these occasions, testified
that on Monday mornings he picked Oswald up at a point which
is many blocks from Hutchison’s store and ordinarily by 7:20 a.m.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-817" href="#Footnote_C6-817" class="fnanchor">C6-817</a>
Hutchison also testified that Ruth Paine was an occasional customer
in his store;<a id="FNanchor_C6-818" href="#Footnote_C6-818" class="fnanchor">C6-818</a> however, Mrs. Paine indicated that she was not in
the store as often as Hutchison testified;<a id="FNanchor_C6-819" href="#Footnote_C6-819" class="fnanchor">C6-819</a> and her appearance is dissimilar
to the description of the woman Hutchison stated was Mrs.
Paine.<a id="FNanchor_C6-820" href="#Footnote_C6-820" class="fnanchor">C6-820</a> In light of the strong reasons for doubting the correctness
of Hutchison’s testimony and the absence of any other sign that Oswald
ever possessed a personal check for $189, the Commission was unable to
conclude that he ever received such a check.</p>

<p>The Commission has also examined a report that, not long before
the assassination, Oswald may have received unaccounted funds
through money orders sent to him in Dallas. Five days after the
assassination, C.A. Hamblen, early night manager for the Western
Union Telegraph Co. in Dallas, told his superior that about 2 weeks
earlier he remembered Oswald sending a telegram from the office to
Washington, D.C., possibly to the Secretary of the Navy, and that the
application was completed in an unusual form of hand printing.<a id="FNanchor_C6-821" href="#Footnote_C6-821" class="fnanchor">C6-821</a>
The next day Hamblen told a magazine correspondent who was in
the Western Union office on other business that he remembered seeing
Oswald in the office on prior occasions collecting money orders for
small amounts of money.<a id="FNanchor_C6-822" href="#Footnote_C6-822" class="fnanchor">C6-822</a> Soon thereafter Hamblen signed a statement
relating to both the telegram and the money orders, and specifying
two instances in which he had seen the person he believed to be
Oswald in the office; in each instance the man had behaved disagreeably
and one other Western Union employee had become involved in assisting
him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-823" href="#Footnote_C6-823" class="fnanchor">C6-823</a></p>

<p>During his testimony, Hamblen did not recall with clarity the
statements he had previously made, and was unable to state whether
the person he reportedly had seen in the Western Union office was or
was not Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-824" href="#Footnote_C6-824" class="fnanchor">C6-824</a> Investigation has disclosed that a
second employee does recall one of the occurrences described by
Hamblen, and believes that the money order in question was delivered
“to someone at the YMCA”; however, he is unable to state whether or
not the man involved was Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-825" href="#Footnote_C6-825" class="fnanchor">C6-825</a> The employee referred to by
Hamblen in connection with the second incident feels certain that the
unusual episode described by Hamblen did not occur, and that she at
no time observed Oswald in the Western Union office.<a id="FNanchor_C6-826" href="#Footnote_C6-826" class="fnanchor">C6-826</a></p>

<p>At the request of Federal investigators, officers of Western Union
conducted a complete search of their records in Dallas and in other
cities, for the period from June through November 1963, for money
orders payable to Lee Harvey Oswald or his known aliases and for
telegrams sent by Oswald or his known aliases. In addition, all money
orders addressed to persons at the YMCA in Dallas during October
and November 1963 were inspected, and all telegrams handled from
November 1 through November 22 by the employee who Hamblen
assertedly saw service Oswald were examined, as were all telegrams
sent from Dallas to Washington during November. No indication of
any such money order or telegram was found in any of these records.<a id="FNanchor_C6-827" href="#Footnote_C6-827" class="fnanchor">C6-827</a>
Hamblen himself participated in this search, and was “unable * * * to
pin down any of these telegrams or money orders that would indicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
it was Oswald.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-828" href="#Footnote_C6-828" class="fnanchor">C6-828</a> Hamblen’s superiors have concluded “that this
whole thing was a figment of Mr. Hamblen’s imagination,”<a id="FNanchor_C6-829" href="#Footnote_C6-829" class="fnanchor">C6-829</a> and the
Commission accepts this assessment.</p>

<h3 id="hdr134">POSSIBLE CONSPIRACY INVOLVING JACK RUBY</h3>

<p>Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald at 11:21 a.m., on Sunday,
November 24, 1963, shortly after Ruby entered the basement of the
Dallas Police Department. Almost immediately, speculation arose
that Ruby had acted on behalf of members of a conspiracy who had
planned the killing of President Kennedy and wanted to silence
Oswald. This section of chapter VI sets forth the Commission’s investigation
into the possibility that Ruby, together with Oswald
or with others, conspired to kill the President, or that Ruby, though
not part of any such conspiracy, had accomplices in the slaying of
Oswald. Presented first are the results of the Commission’s detailed
inquiry into Ruby’s actions from November 21 to November 24.
In addition, this section analyzes the numerous rumors and suspicions
that Ruby and Oswald were acquainted and examines Ruby’s background
and associations for evidence of any conspiratorial relationship
or motive. A detailed life of Ruby is given in appendix XVI which
provides supplemental information about Ruby and his associations.</p>

<h4 id="hdr135">Ruby’s Activities From November 21 to November 24, 1963</h4>

<p>The Commission has attempted to reconstruct as precisely as possible
the movements of Jack Ruby during the period November
21-November 24, 1963. It has done so on the premise that, if
Jack Ruby were involved in a conspiracy, his activities and associations
during this period would, in some way, have reflected the conspiratorial
relationship. The Commission has not attempted to determine
the time at which Ruby first decided to make his attack on Lee Harvey
Oswald, nor does it purport to evaluate the psychiatric and related
legal questions which have arisen from the assault upon Oswald.
Ruby’s activities during this 3-day period have been scrutinized, however,
for the insight they provide into whether the shooting of Oswald
was grounded in any form of conspiracy.</p>

<p><i>The eve of the President’s visit.</i>—On Thursday, November 21, Jack
Ruby was attending to his usual duties as the proprietor of two Dallas
night spots—the Carousel Club, a downtown nightclub featuring striptease
dancers, and the Vegas Club, a rock-and-roll establishment in the
Oaklawn section of Dallas. Both clubs opened for business each day
in the early evening and continued 7 days a week until after midnight.<a id="FNanchor_C6-830" href="#Footnote_C6-830" class="fnanchor">C6-830</a>
Ruby arrived at the Carousel Club at about 3 p.m. Thursday
afternoon, as was his custom,<a id="FNanchor_C6-831" href="#Footnote_C6-831" class="fnanchor">C6-831</a> and remained long enough to chat
with a friend and receive messages from Larry Crafard, a handyman
and helper who lived at the Carousel.<a id="FNanchor_C6-832" href="#Footnote_C6-832" class="fnanchor">C6-832</a> Earlier in the day Ruby
had visited with a young lady who was job hunting in Dallas,<a id="FNanchor_C6-833" href="#Footnote_C6-833" class="fnanchor">C6-833</a> paid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
his rent for the Carousel premises,<a id="FNanchor_C6-834" href="#Footnote_C6-834" class="fnanchor">C6-834</a> conferred about a peace bond he
had been obliged to post as a result of a fight with one of his striptease
dancers,<a id="FNanchor_C6-835" href="#Footnote_C6-835" class="fnanchor">C6-835</a> consulted with an attorney about problems he was having
with Federal tax authorities,<a id="FNanchor_C6-836" href="#Footnote_C6-836" class="fnanchor">C6-836</a> distributed membership cards for the
Carousel Club,<a id="FNanchor_C6-837" href="#Footnote_C6-837" class="fnanchor">C6-837</a> talked with Dallas County Assistant District Attorney
William F. Alexander about insufficient fund checks which a
friend had passed,<a id="FNanchor_C6-838" href="#Footnote_C6-838" class="fnanchor">C6-838</a> and submitted advertising copy for his nightclubs
to the Dallas Morning News.<a id="FNanchor_C6-839" href="#Footnote_C6-839" class="fnanchor">C6-839</a></p>

<p>Ruby’s evening activities on Thursday, November 21, were a combination
of business and pleasure. At approximately 7:30 p.m., he
drove Larry Crafard to the Vegas Club which Crafard was overseeing
because Ruby’s sister, Eva Grant, who normally managed the club,
was convalescing from a recent illness.<a id="FNanchor_C6-840" href="#Footnote_C6-840" class="fnanchor">C6-840</a> Thereafter, Ruby returned
to the Carousel Club and conversed for about an hour
with Lawrence Meyers, a Chicago businessman.<a id="FNanchor_C6-841" href="#Footnote_C6-841" class="fnanchor">C6-841</a> Between 9:45 and
10:45 p.m., Ruby had dinner with Ralph Paul, his close friend and
financial backer. While dining Ruby spoke briefly with a Dallas
Morning News employee, Don Campbell, who suggested that they go
to the Castaway Club, but Ruby declined.<a id="FNanchor_C6-842" href="#Footnote_C6-842" class="fnanchor">C6-842</a> Thereafter, Ruby returned
to the Carousel Club where he acted as master of ceremonies for
his show and peacefully ejected an unruly patron.<a id="FNanchor_C6-843" href="#Footnote_C6-843" class="fnanchor">C6-843</a> At about midnight
Ruby rejoined Meyers at the Bon Vivant Room of the Dallas
Cabana where they met Meyers’ brother and sister-in-law.<a id="FNanchor_C6-844" href="#Footnote_C6-844" class="fnanchor">C6-844</a> Neither
Ralph Paul nor Lawrence Meyers recalled that Ruby mentioned the
President’s trip to Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-845" href="#Footnote_C6-845" class="fnanchor">C6-845</a> Leaving Meyers at the Cabana after a
brief visit, Ruby returned to close the Carousel Club and obtain the
night’s receipts.<a id="FNanchor_C6-846" href="#Footnote_C6-846" class="fnanchor">C6-846</a> He then went to the Vegas Club which he helped
Larry Crafard close for the night;<a id="FNanchor_C6-847" href="#Footnote_C6-847" class="fnanchor">C6-847</a> and, as late as 2:30 a.m., Ruby
was seen eating at a restaurant near the Vegas Club.<a id="FNanchor_C6-848" href="#Footnote_C6-848" class="fnanchor">C6-848</a></p>

<p><i>Friday morning at the Dallas Morning News.</i>—Jack Ruby learned
of the shooting of President Kennedy while in the second-floor advertising
offices of the Dallas Morning News, five blocks from the Texas
School Book Depository, where he had come Friday morning to place
regular weekend advertisements for his two nightclubs.<a id="FNanchor_C6-849" href="#Footnote_C6-849" class="fnanchor">C6-849</a> On arriving
at the newspaper building at about 11 or 11:30 a.m., he talked briefly
with two newspaper employees concerning some diet pills he had
recommended to them.<a id="FNanchor_C6-850" href="#Footnote_C6-850" class="fnanchor">C6-850</a> Ruby then went to the office of Morning
News columnist, Tony Zoppi, where he states he obtained a brochure
on his new master of ceremonies that he wanted to use in preparing
copy for his advertisements.<a id="FNanchor_C6-851" href="#Footnote_C6-851" class="fnanchor">C6-851</a> Proceeding to the advertising department,
he spoke with advertising employee Don Campbell from about
noon until 12:25 p.m. when Campbell left the office.<a id="FNanchor_C6-852" href="#Footnote_C6-852" class="fnanchor">C6-852</a> In addition to
the business at hand, much of the conversation concerned Ruby’s unhappiness
over the financial condition of his clubs and his professed
ability to handle the physical fights which arose in connection with the
clubs.<a id="FNanchor_C6-853" href="#Footnote_C6-853" class="fnanchor">C6-853</a> According to Campbell, Ruby did not mention the Presidential
motorcade nor did he display any unusual behavior.<a id="FNanchor_C6-854" href="#Footnote_C6-854" class="fnanchor">C6-854</a></p>

<p>About 10 minutes after the President had been shot but before word
had spread to the second floor, John Newnam, an advertising department<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
employee, observed Ruby sitting at the same spot where
Campbell had left him. At that time Ruby had completed the
advertisement, which he had apparently begun to compose when
Campbell departed, and was reading a newspaper.<a id="FNanchor_C6-855" href="#Footnote_C6-855" class="fnanchor">C6-855</a> To Newnam,
Ruby voiced criticism of the black-bordered advertisement entitled
“Welcome, Mr. Kennedy” appearing in the morning paper and bearing
the name of Bernard Weissman as the chairman of the committee
sponsoring the advertisement.<a id="FNanchor_C6-856" href="#Footnote_C6-856" class="fnanchor">C6-856</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 1031,
<a href="#Page_294">p. 294</a>.) According to Eva Grant, Ruby’s sister, he had telephoned her
earlier in the morning to call her attention to the ad.<a id="FNanchor_C6-857" href="#Footnote_C6-857" class="fnanchor">C6-857</a> At about 12:45
p.m., an employee entered the office and announced that shots had been
fired at the President. Newnam remembered that Ruby responded
with a look of “stunned disbelief.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-858" href="#Footnote_C6-858" class="fnanchor">C6-858</a></p>

<p>Shortly afterward, according to Newnam, “confusion reigned” in
the office as advertisers telephoned to cancel advertising they had
placed for the weekend.<a id="FNanchor_C6-859" href="#Footnote_C6-859" class="fnanchor">C6-859</a> Ruby appears to have believed that some
of those cancellations were motivated by the Weissman advertisement.<a id="FNanchor_C6-860" href="#Footnote_C6-860" class="fnanchor">C6-860</a>
After Newnam accepted a few telephone calls, he and Ruby
walked toward a room where other persons were watching television.<a id="FNanchor_C6-861" href="#Footnote_C6-861" class="fnanchor">C6-861</a>
One of the newspaper employees recalled that Ruby then appeared
“obviously shaken, and an ashen color—just very pale * * *”<a id="FNanchor_C6-862" href="#Footnote_C6-862" class="fnanchor">C6-862</a>
showed little disposition to converse,<a id="FNanchor_C6-863" href="#Footnote_C6-863" class="fnanchor">C6-863</a> and sat for a while with a dazed
expression in his eyes.<a id="FNanchor_C6-864" href="#Footnote_C6-864" class="fnanchor">C6-864</a></p>

<p>After a few minutes, Ruby placed telephone calls to Andrew Armstrong,
his assistant at the Carousel Club, and to his sister, Mrs.
Grant. He told Armstrong, “If anything happens we are going to
close the club” and said he would see him in about 30 minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C6-865" href="#Footnote_C6-865" class="fnanchor">C6-865</a>
During the call to his sister, Ruby again referred to the Weissman
advertisement; at one point he put the telephone to Newnam’s ear,
and Newnam heard Mrs. Grant exclaim, “My God, what do they
want?” It was Newnam’s recollection that Ruby tried to calm her.<a id="FNanchor_C6-866" href="#Footnote_C6-866" class="fnanchor">C6-866</a></p>

<p>Ruby testified that after calling his sister he said, “John, I will have
to leave Dallas.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-867" href="#Footnote_C6-867" class="fnanchor">C6-867</a> Ruby explained to the Commission:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don’t know why I said that, but it is a funny reaction that you
feel; the city is terribly let down by the tragedy that happened.
And I said, “John, I am not opening up tonight.”</p>

<p>And I don’t know what else transpired. I know people were
just heartbroken * * *.</p>

<p>I left the building and I went down and I got in my car and
I couldn’t stop crying. * * * <a id="FNanchor_C6-868" href="#Footnote_C6-868" class="fnanchor">C6-868</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Newnam estimated that Ruby departed from the Morning News at
about 1:30 p.m., but other testimony indicated that Ruby may have
left earlier.<a id="FNanchor_C6-869" href="#Footnote_C6-869" class="fnanchor">C6-869</a></p>

<p><i>Ruby’s alleged visit to Parkland Hospital.</i>—The Commission has
investigated claims that Jack Ruby was at Parkland Hospital at about
1:30 p.m., when a Presidential press secretary, Malcolm Kilduff, announced
that President Kennedy was dead. Seth Kantor, a newspaperman
who had previously met Ruby in Dallas, reported and later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
testified that Jack Ruby stopped him momentarily inside the main entrance
to Parkland Hospital some time between 1:30 and 2 p.m., Friday,
November 22, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-870" href="#Footnote_C6-870" class="fnanchor">C6-870</a> The only other person besides Kantor who
recalled seeing Ruby at the hospital did not make known her observation
until April 1964, had never seen Ruby before, allegedly saw him
only briefly then, had an obstructed view, and was uncertain of the
time.<a id="FNanchor_C6-871" href="#Footnote_C6-871" class="fnanchor">C6-871</a> Ruby has firmly denied going to Parkland and has stated
that he went to the Carousel Club upon leaving the Morning News.<a id="FNanchor_C6-872" href="#Footnote_C6-872" class="fnanchor">C6-872</a>
Video tapes of the scene at Parkland do not show Ruby there, although
Kantor can be seen.<a id="FNanchor_C6-873" href="#Footnote_C6-873" class="fnanchor">C6-873</a></p>

<p>Investigation has limited the period during which Kantor could have
met Ruby at Parkland Hospital on Friday to a few minutes before
and after 1:30 p.m. Telephone company records and the testimony of
Andrew Armstrong established that Ruby arrived at the Carousel
Club no later than 1:45 p.m. and probably a few minutes earlier.<a id="FNanchor_C6-874" href="#Footnote_C6-874" class="fnanchor">C6-874</a>
Kantor was engaged in a long-distance telephone call to his Washington
office from 1:02 p.m. until 1:27 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-875" href="#Footnote_C6-875" class="fnanchor">C6-875</a> Kantor testified that, after
completing that call, he immediately left the building from which he
had been telephoning, traveled perhaps 100 yards, and entered the
main entrance of the hospital. It was there, as he walked through a
small doorway, that he believed he saw Jack Ruby, who, Kantor said,
tugged at his coattails and asked, “Should I close my places for the
next three nights, do you think?” Kantor recalled that he turned
briefly to Ruby and proceeded to the press conference at which the
President’s death was announced. Kantor was certain he encountered
Ruby at Parkland but had doubts about the exact time and place.<a id="FNanchor_C6-876" href="#Footnote_C6-876" class="fnanchor">C6-876</a></p>

<p>Kantor probably did not see Ruby at Parkland Hospital in the few
minutes before or after 1:30 p.m., the only time it would have been
possible for Kantor to have done so. If Ruby immediately returned
to the Carousel Club after Kantor saw him, it would have been necessary
for him to have covered the distance from Parkland in approximately
10 or 15 minutes in order to have arrived at the club before 1:45
p.m., when a telephone call was placed at Ruby’s request to his entertainer,
Karen Bennett Carlin.<a id="FNanchor_C6-877" href="#Footnote_C6-877" class="fnanchor">C6-877</a> At a normal driving speed under normal
conditions the trip can be made in 9 or 10 minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C6-878" href="#Footnote_C6-878" class="fnanchor">C6-878</a> However, it
is likely that congested traffic conditions on November 22 would have
extended the driving time.<a id="FNanchor_C6-879" href="#Footnote_C6-879" class="fnanchor">C6-879</a> Even if Ruby had been able to drive
from Parkland to the Carousel in 15 minutes, his presence at the Dallas
Morning News until after 1 p.m., and at the Carousel prior to
1:45 p.m., would have made his visit at Parkland exceedingly brief.
Since Ruby was observed at the Dallas Police Department during a 2
hour period after 11 p.m. on Friday,<a id="FNanchor_C6-880" href="#Footnote_C6-880" class="fnanchor">C6-880</a> when Kantor was also present,
and since Kantor did not remember seeing Ruby there,<a id="FNanchor_C6-881" href="#Footnote_C6-881" class="fnanchor">C6-881</a> Kantor
may have been mistaken about both the time and the place that
he saw Ruby. When seeing Ruby, Kantor was preoccupied with
the important event that a press conference represented. Both
Ruby and Kantor were present at another important event, a press
conference held about midnight, November 22, in the assembly room
of the Dallas Police Department. It is conceivable that Kantor’s encounter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
with Ruby occurred at that time, perhaps near the small doorway
there.<a id="FNanchor_C6-882" href="#Footnote_C6-882" class="fnanchor">C6-882</a></p>

<p><i>Ruby’s decision to close his clubs.</i>—Upon arriving at the Carousel
Club shortly before 1:45 p.m., Ruby instructed Andrew Armstrong,
the Carousel’s bartender, to notify employees that the club would be
closed that night.<a id="FNanchor_C6-883" href="#Footnote_C6-883" class="fnanchor">C6-883</a> During much of the next hour Ruby talked by
telephone to several persons who were or had been especially close
to him, and the remainder of the time he watched television and spoke
with Armstrong and Larry Crafard about the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-884" href="#Footnote_C6-884" class="fnanchor">C6-884</a> At
1:51 p.m., Ruby telephoned Ralph Paul in Arlington, Tex., to say that
he was going to close his clubs. He urged Paul to do likewise with his
drive-in restaurant.<a id="FNanchor_C6-885" href="#Footnote_C6-885" class="fnanchor">C6-885</a> Unable to reach Alice Nichols, a former girl
friend, who was at lunch, Ruby telephoned his sister, Eileen Kaminsky,
in Chicago.<a id="FNanchor_C6-886" href="#Footnote_C6-886" class="fnanchor">C6-886</a> Mrs. Kaminsky described her brother as completely
unnerved and crying about President Kennedy’s death.<a id="FNanchor_C6-887" href="#Footnote_C6-887" class="fnanchor">C6-887</a>
To Mrs. Nichols, whose return call caused Ruby to cut short his conversation
with Mrs. Kaminsky, Ruby expressed shock over the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-888" href="#Footnote_C6-888" class="fnanchor">C6-888</a>
Although Mrs. Nichols had dated Ruby for nearly 11
years, she was surprised to hear from him on November 22 since they
had not seen one another socially for some time.<a id="FNanchor_C6-889" href="#Footnote_C6-889" class="fnanchor">C6-889</a> Thereafter, Ruby
telephoned at 2:37 p.m. to Alex Gruber, a boyhood friend from Chicago
who was living in Los Angeles.<a id="FNanchor_C6-890" href="#Footnote_C6-890" class="fnanchor">C6-890</a> Gruber recalled that in their 3-minute
conversation Ruby talked about a dog he had promised to send
Gruber, a carwash business Gruber had considered starting, and the
assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-891" href="#Footnote_C6-891" class="fnanchor">C6-891</a> Ruby apparently lost his self-control during the
conversation and terminated it.<a id="FNanchor_C6-892" href="#Footnote_C6-892" class="fnanchor">C6-892</a> However, 2 minutes after that call
ended, Ruby telephoned again to Ralph Paul.<a id="FNanchor_C6-893" href="#Footnote_C6-893" class="fnanchor">C6-893</a></p>

<p>Upon leaving the Carousel Club at about 3:15 p.m., Ruby drove to
Eva Grant’s home but left soon after he arrived, to obtain some weekend
food for his sister and himself.<a id="FNanchor_C6-894" href="#Footnote_C6-894" class="fnanchor">C6-894</a> He first returned to the Carousel
Club and directed Larry Crafard to prepare a sign indicating that
the club would be closed; however, Ruby instructed Crafard not to post
the sign until later in the evening to avoid informing his competitors
that he would be closed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-895" href="#Footnote_C6-895" class="fnanchor">C6-895</a> (See Commission Exhibit 2427, <a href="#Page_339">p. 339</a>.)
Before leaving the club, Ruby telephoned Mrs. Grant who reminded
him to purchase food.<a id="FNanchor_C6-896" href="#Footnote_C6-896" class="fnanchor">C6-896</a> As a result he went to the Ritz Delicatessen,
about two blocks from the Carousel Club, and bought a great quantity
of cold cuts.<a id="FNanchor_C6-897" href="#Footnote_C6-897" class="fnanchor">C6-897</a></p>

<p>Ruby probably arrived a second time at his sister’s home close to
5:30 p.m. and remained for about 2 hours. He continued his rapid
rate of telephone calls, ate sparingly, became ill, and attempted to get
some rest.<a id="FNanchor_C6-898" href="#Footnote_C6-898" class="fnanchor">C6-898</a> While at the apartment, Ruby decided to close his clubs
for 3 days. He testified that after talking to Don Saffran, a columnist
for the Dallas Times-Herald:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I put the receiver down and talked to my sister, and I said, “Eva,
what shall we do?”</p>

<p>And she said, “Jack, let’s close for the 3 days.” She said, “We
don’t have anything anyway, but we owe it to—” (chokes up.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
So I called Don Saffran back immediately and I said, “Don,
we decided to close for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.”</p>

<p>And he said, “Okay.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-899" href="#Footnote_C6-899" class="fnanchor">C6-899</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Ruby then telephoned the Dallas Morning News to cancel his advertisement
and, when unable to do so, he changed his ad to read that his
clubs would be closed for the weekend.<a id="FNanchor_C6-900" href="#Footnote_C6-900" class="fnanchor">C6-900</a> Ruby also telephoned Cecil
Hamlin, a friend of many years. Sounding very “broken up,” he told
Hamlin that he had closed the clubs since he thought most people
would not be in the mood to visit them and that he felt concern for
President Kennedy’s “kids.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-901" href="#Footnote_C6-901" class="fnanchor">C6-901</a> Thereafter he made two calls to ascertain
when services at Temple Shearith Israel would be held.<a id="FNanchor_C6-902" href="#Footnote_C6-902" class="fnanchor">C6-902</a> He
placed a second call to Alice Nichols to tell her of his intention to
attend those services<a id="FNanchor_C6-903" href="#Footnote_C6-903" class="fnanchor">C6-903</a> and phoned Larry Crafard at the Carousel to
ask whether he had received any messages.<a id="FNanchor_C6-904" href="#Footnote_C6-904" class="fnanchor">C6-904</a> Eva Grant testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When he was leaving, he looked pretty bad. This I remember.
I can’t explain it to you. He looked too broken, a broken man
already. He did make the remark, he said, “I never felt so bad
in my life, even when Ma or Pa died.”</p>

<p>So I said, “Well, Pa was an old man. He was almost 89
years. * * *”<a id="FNanchor_C6-905" href="#Footnote_C6-905" class="fnanchor">C6-905</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Friday evening.</i>—Ruby is uncertain whether he went directly from
his sister’s home to his apartment or possibly first to his club.<a id="FNanchor_C6-906" href="#Footnote_C6-906" class="fnanchor">C6-906</a> At
least 5 witnesses recall seeing a man they believe was Ruby on the
third floor of police headquarters at times they have estimated between
6 and 9 p.m.;<a id="FNanchor_C6-907" href="#Footnote_C6-907" class="fnanchor">C6-907</a> however, it is not clear that Ruby was present at
the Police and Courts Building before 11 p.m. With respect to
three of the witnesses, it is doubtful that the man observed was Ruby.
Two of those persons had not known Ruby previously and described
wearing apparel which differed both from Ruby’s known dress that
night and from his known wardrobe.<a id="FNanchor_C6-908" href="#Footnote_C6-908" class="fnanchor">C6-908</a> The third, who viewed from
the rear the person he believed was Ruby, said the man unsuccessfully
attempted to enter the homicide office.<a id="FNanchor_C6-909" href="#Footnote_C6-909" class="fnanchor">C6-909</a> Of the police officers on
duty near homicide at the time of the alleged event, only one remembered
the episode, and he said the man in question definitely was not
Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-910" href="#Footnote_C6-910" class="fnanchor">C6-910</a> The remaining witnesses knew or talked with Ruby, and
their testimony leaves little doubt that they did see him on the third
floor at some point on Friday night; however the possibility remains
that they observed Ruby later in the evening, when his presence is conclusively
established.<a id="FNanchor_C6-911" href="#Footnote_C6-911" class="fnanchor">C6-911</a> Ruby has denied being at the police department
Friday night before approximately 11:15 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-912" href="#Footnote_C6-912" class="fnanchor">C6-912</a></p>

<p>In any event, Ruby eventually returned to his own apartment before
9 p.m. There he telephoned Ralph Paul but was unable to persuade
Paul to join him at synagogue services.<a id="FNanchor_C6-913" href="#Footnote_C6-913" class="fnanchor">C6-913</a> Shortly after 9 p.m., Ruby
called the Chicago home of his oldest brother, Hyman Rubenstein,
and two of his sisters, Marion Carroll and Ann Volpert.<a id="FNanchor_C6-914" href="#Footnote_C6-914" class="fnanchor">C6-914</a> Hyman
Rubenstein testified that, during the call, his brother was so disturbed
about the situation in Dallas that he mentioned selling his business
and returning to Chicago.<a id="FNanchor_C6-915" href="#Footnote_C6-915" class="fnanchor">C6-915</a> From his apartment, Ruby drove to
Temple Shearith Israel, arriving near the end of a 2-hour service
which had begun at 8 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-916" href="#Footnote_C6-916" class="fnanchor">C6-916</a> Rabbi Hillel Silverman, who greeted
him among the crowd leaving the services<a id="FNanchor_C6-917" href="#Footnote_C6-917" class="fnanchor">C6-917</a> was surprised that
Ruby, who appeared depressed, mentioned only his sister’s recent illness
and said nothing about the assassination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-918" href="#Footnote_C6-918" class="fnanchor">C6-918</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
Ruby related that, after joining in the postservice refreshments,<a id="FNanchor_C6-919" href="#Footnote_C6-919" class="fnanchor">C6-919</a>
he drove by some night clubs, noticing whether or not they had been
closed as his were.<a id="FNanchor_C6-920" href="#Footnote_C6-920" class="fnanchor">C6-920</a> He testified that, as he drove toward town, a
radio announcement that the Dallas police were working overtime
prompted the thought that he might bring those at police headquarters
something to eat.<a id="FNanchor_C6-921" href="#Footnote_C6-921" class="fnanchor">C6-921</a> At about 10:30 p.m., he stopped at a delicatessen
near the Vegas Club and purchased 8 kosher sandwiches and 10 soft
drinks.<a id="FNanchor_C6-922" href="#Footnote_C6-922" class="fnanchor">C6-922</a> From the delicatessen, he called the police department but
was told that the officers had already eaten.<a id="FNanchor_C6-923" href="#Footnote_C6-923" class="fnanchor">C6-923</a> He said he then tried to
offer the food to employees at radio station KLIF but failed in several
attempts to obtain the private night line number to the station.<a id="FNanchor_C6-924" href="#Footnote_C6-924" class="fnanchor">C6-924</a> On
three occasions between phone calls, Ruby spoke with a group of students
whom he did not know, lamenting the President’s death, teasing
one of the young men about being too young for his clubs, borrowing
their copy of the Dallas Times Herald to see how his advertisements
had been run, and stating that his clubs were the only ones that had
closed because of the assassination. He also expressed the opinion, as
he had earlier in the day, that the assassination would be harmful to
the convention business in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-925" href="#Footnote_C6-925" class="fnanchor">C6-925</a> Upon leaving the delicatessen
with his purchases, Ruby gave the counterman as a tip a card granting
free admission to his clubs.<a id="FNanchor_C6-926" href="#Footnote_C6-926" class="fnanchor">C6-926</a> He drove downtown to the police station
where he has said he hoped to find an employee from KLIF who
could give him the “hot line” phone number for the radio station.<a id="FNanchor_C6-927" href="#Footnote_C6-927" class="fnanchor">C6-927</a></p>

<p><i>The third floor of police headquarters.</i>—Ruby is known to have
made his way, by about 11:30 p.m., to the third floor of the Dallas
Police Department where reporters were congregated near the homicide
bureau.<a id="FNanchor_C6-928" href="#Footnote_C6-928" class="fnanchor">C6-928</a> Newsman John Rutledge, one of those who may well
have been mistaken as to time, gave the following description of his
first encounter with Ruby at the police station:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I saw Jack and two out-of-state reporters, whom I did not
know, leave the elevator door and proceed toward those television
cameras, to go around the corner where Captain Fritz’s office
was. Jack walked between them. These two out-of-state reporters
had big press cards pinned on their coats, great big red
ones, I think they said “President Kennedy’s Visit to Dallas—Press”,
or something like that. And Jack didn’t have one, but
the man on either side of him did. And they walked pretty
rapidly from the elevator area past the policeman, and Jack
was bent over like this—writing on a piece of paper, and talking
to one of the reporters, and pointing to something on the piece
of paper, he was kind of hunched over.<a id="FNanchor_C6-929" href="#Footnote_C6-929" class="fnanchor">C6-929</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Detective Augustus M. Eberhardt, who also recalled that he first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
saw Ruby earlier in the evening, said Ruby carried a note pad and
professed to be a translator for the Israeli press. He remembered
Ruby’s remarking how unfortunate the assassination was for the city
of Dallas and that it was “hard to realize that a complete nothing,
a zero like that, could kill a man like President Kennedy * * *.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-930" href="#Footnote_C6-930" class="fnanchor">C6-930</a></p>

<p>Video tapes confirm Ruby’s statement that he was present on the
third floor when Chief Jesse E. Curry and District Attorney Henry M.
Wade announced that Oswald would be shown to the newsmen at a
press conference in the basement.<a id="FNanchor_C6-931" href="#Footnote_C6-931" class="fnanchor">C6-931</a> Though he has said his original
purpose was only to locate a KLIF employee, Ruby has stated that

Oswald arrived, Ruby, together with a number of newsmen, was
standing atop a table on one side of the room.<a id="FNanchor_C6-934" href="#Footnote_C6-934" class="fnanchor">C6-934</a> (See Commission
Exhibit No. 2424, <a href="#Page_341">p. 341</a>.) Oswald was taken from the room after a
brief appearance, and Ruby remained to hear reporters question
District Attorney Wade. During the press conference, Wade stated
that Oswald would probably be moved to the county jail at the beginning
of the next week.<a id="FNanchor_C6-935" href="#Footnote_C6-935" class="fnanchor">C6-935</a> In answer to one question, Wade said that
Oswald belonged to the “Free Cuba Committee.” A few reporters
spoke up correcting Wade and among the voices was that of Jack
Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-936" href="#Footnote_C6-936" class="fnanchor">C6-936</a></p>

<p>Ruby later followed the district attorney out of the press conference,
walked up to him and, according to Wade, said “Hi Henry * * * Don’t
you know me? * * * I am Jack Ruby, I run the Vegas Club. * * *”<a id="FNanchor_C6-937" href="#Footnote_C6-937" class="fnanchor">C6-937</a>
Ruby also introduced himself to Justice of the Peace David L. Johnston,
shook his hand, gave Johnston a business card to the Carousel
Club, and, upon learning Johnston’s official position, shook Johnston’s
hand again.<a id="FNanchor_C6-938" href="#Footnote_C6-938" class="fnanchor">C6-938</a> After talking with Johnston, he gave another card to
Icarus M. Pappas, a reporter for New York radio station WNEW.<a id="FNanchor_C6-939" href="#Footnote_C6-939" class="fnanchor">C6-939</a>
From a representative of radio station KBOX in Dallas, Ruby obtained
the “hot line” telephone number to KLIF.<a id="FNanchor_C6-940" href="#Footnote_C6-940" class="fnanchor">C6-940</a> He then called
the station and told one of the employees that he would like to come up
to distribute the sandwiches and cold drinks he had purchased.<a id="FNanchor_C6-941" href="#Footnote_C6-941" class="fnanchor">C6-941</a> Observing
Pappas holding a telephone line open and attempting to get
the attention of District Attorney Wade, Ruby directed Wade to
Pappas, who proceeded to interview the district attorney.<a id="FNanchor_C6-942" href="#Footnote_C6-942" class="fnanchor">C6-942</a> Ruby
then called KLIF a second time and offered to secure an interview with
Wade; he next summoned Wade to his phone, whereupon KLIF recorded
a telephone interview with the district attorney.<a id="FNanchor_C6-943" href="#Footnote_C6-943" class="fnanchor">C6-943</a> A few
minutes later. Ruby encountered Russ Knight, a reporter from KLIF
who had left the station for the police department at the beginning of
Ruby’s second telephone call. Ruby directed Knight to Wade and
waited a short distance away while the reporter conducted another
interview with the district attorney.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-944" href="#Footnote_C6-944" class="fnanchor">C6-944</a></p>

<p><i>At radio station KLIF.</i>—When Ruby left police headquarters, he
drove to radio station KLIF, arriving at approximately 1:45 a.m.
and remaining for about 45 minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C6-945" href="#Footnote_C6-945" class="fnanchor">C6-945</a> After first distributing his
sandwiches and soft drinks, Ruby settled in the newsroom for the 2 a.m.
newscast in which he was credited with suggesting that Russ Knight
ask District Attorney Wade whether or not Oswald was sane.<a id="FNanchor_C6-946" href="#Footnote_C6-946" class="fnanchor">C6-946</a> After
the newscast, Ruby gave a Carousel card to one KLIF employee,
although another did not recall that Ruby was promoting his club as he
normally did.<a id="FNanchor_C6-947" href="#Footnote_C6-947" class="fnanchor">C6-947</a> When speaking with KLIF’s Danny Patrick McCurdy,
Ruby mentioned that he was going to close his clubs for the
weekend and that he would rather lose $1,200 or $1,500 than remain
open at that time in the Nation’s history. McCurdy remembered that
Ruby “looked rather pale to me as he was talking to me and he kept
looking at the floor.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-948" href="#Footnote_C6-948" class="fnanchor">C6-948</a> To announcer Glen Duncan, Ruby expressed
satisfaction that the evidence was mounting against Oswald. Duncan
said that Ruby did not appear to be grieving but, instead, seemed
pleased about the personal contact he had had with the investigation
earlier in the evening.<a id="FNanchor_C6-949" href="#Footnote_C6-949" class="fnanchor">C6-949</a></p>

<p>Ruby left the radio station accompanied by Russ Knight. Engaging
Knight in a short conversation, Ruby handed him a radio script
entitled “Heroism” from a conservative radio program called “Life
Line.” It was apparently one of the scripts that had come into
Ruby’s hands a few weeks before at the Texas Products Show when
Hunt Foods were including such scripts with samples of their products.<a id="FNanchor_C6-950" href="#Footnote_C6-950" class="fnanchor">C6-950</a>
The script extolled the virtues of those who embark upon
risky business ventures and stand firmly for causes they believe to
be correct.<a id="FNanchor_C6-951" href="#Footnote_C6-951" class="fnanchor">C6-951</a> Ruby asked Knight’s views on the script and suggested
that there was a group of “radicals” in Dallas which hated
President Kennedy and that the owner of the radio station should
editorialize against this group. Knight could not clearly determine
whether Ruby had reference to persons who sponsored programs like
“Life Line” or to those who held leftwing views.<a id="FNanchor_C6-952" href="#Footnote_C6-952" class="fnanchor">C6-952</a> Knight gained
the impression that Ruby believed such persons, whoever they might
be, were partially responsible for the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-953" href="#Footnote_C6-953" class="fnanchor">C6-953</a></p>

<p><i>Early morning of November 23.</i>—At about 2:30 a.m., Ruby entered
his automobile and departed for the Dallas Times-Herald Building.
En route, he stopped for about an hour to speak with Kay Helen
Coleman, one of his dancers, and Harry Olsen, a member of the
Dallas Police Department, who had hailed him from a parking
garage at the corner of Jackson and Field Streets. The couple were
crying and extremely upset over the assassination. At one point,
according to Ruby, the police officer remarked that “they should cut
this guy [Oswald] inch by inch into ribbons,” and the dancer said
that “in England they would drag him through the streets and would
have hung him.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-954" href="#Footnote_C6-954" class="fnanchor">C6-954</a> Although Ruby failed to mention this episode
during his first two FBI interviews,<a id="FNanchor_C6-955" href="#Footnote_C6-955" class="fnanchor">C6-955</a> he later explained that his
reason for failing to do so was that he did not “want to involve
them in anything, because it was supposed to be a secret that he
[the police officer] was going with this young lady.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-956" href="#Footnote_C6-956" class="fnanchor">C6-956</a> About<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
6 weeks after the assassination, Olsen left the Dallas Police Department
and married Miss Coleman. Both Olsen and his wife testified
that they were greatly upset during their lengthy conversation with
Ruby early Saturday morning; but Mrs. Olsen denied and Olsen
did not recall the remarks ascribed to them.<a id="FNanchor_C6-957" href="#Footnote_C6-957" class="fnanchor">C6-957</a> The Olsens claimed
instead that Ruby had cursed Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-958" href="#Footnote_C6-958" class="fnanchor">C6-958</a> Mrs. Olsen also mentioned
that Ruby expressed sympathy for Mrs. Kennedy and her children.<a id="FNanchor_C6-959" href="#Footnote_C6-959" class="fnanchor">C6-959</a></p>

<p>From Jackson and Field Streets, Ruby drove to the Dallas Times-Herald,
where he talked for about 15 minutes with composing room
employee Roy Pryor, who had just finished a shift at 4 a.m.
Ruby mentioned that he had seen Oswald earlier in the night, that he
had corrected Henry Wade in connection with the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee, and that he had set up a telephone interview with Wade.
Pryor testified that Ruby explicitly stated to him that he believed he
was in good favor with the district attorney.<a id="FNanchor_C6-960" href="#Footnote_C6-960" class="fnanchor">C6-960</a> Recalling that Ruby
described Oswald as a “little weasel of a guy” and was emotionally concerned
about the President’s wife and children, Pryor also was impressed
by Ruby’s sorrowful mood and remembered that, as he talked,
Ruby shook a newspaper to emphasize his concern over the
assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-961" href="#Footnote_C6-961" class="fnanchor">C6-961</a></p>

<p>When Pryor left the composing room, Ruby remained and continued
speaking with other employees, including Arthur Watherwax and the
foreman, Clyde Gadash. Ruby, who often visited the Times-Herald
at that early morning hour in connection with his ads, sought Watherwax’s
views on his decision to close his clubs and indicated he was
going to attempt to persuade other club owners to do likewise.
Watherwax described Ruby as “pretty shaken up” about the assassination
and at the same time “excited” that he had attended Oswald’s
Friday night press conference.<a id="FNanchor_C6-962" href="#Footnote_C6-962" class="fnanchor">C6-962</a></p>

<p>While at the Times-Herald, Ruby displayed to the composing room
employees a “twistboard” he had previously promised to Gadash.<a id="FNanchor_C6-963" href="#Footnote_C6-963" class="fnanchor">C6-963</a>
The twistboard was an exercising device consisting of two pieces of
hardened materials joined together by a lazy susan bearing so that
one piece could remain stationary on the floor while a person stood
atop it and swiveled to and fro.<a id="FNanchor_C6-964" href="#Footnote_C6-964" class="fnanchor">C6-964</a> Ruby had been trying to promote
sales of the board in the weeks before President Kennedy was killed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-965" href="#Footnote_C6-965" class="fnanchor">C6-965</a>
Considerable merriment developed when one of the women employees
at the Times-Herald demonstrated the board, and Ruby himself,
put on a demonstration for those assembled.<a id="FNanchor_C6-966" href="#Footnote_C6-966" class="fnanchor">C6-966</a> He later testified:
“* * * not that I wanted to get in with the hilarity of frolicking,
but he [Gadash] asked me to show him, and the other men gathered
around.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-967" href="#Footnote_C6-967" class="fnanchor">C6-967</a> Gadash agreed that Ruby’s general mood was one of
sorrow.<a id="FNanchor_C6-968" href="#Footnote_C6-968" class="fnanchor">C6-968</a></p>

<p>At about 4:30 a.m., Ruby drove from the Dallas Times-Herald
to his apartment where he awakened his roommate George Senator.<a id="FNanchor_C6-969" href="#Footnote_C6-969" class="fnanchor">C6-969</a>
During his visit in the composing room Ruby had expressed
the view that the Weissman advertisement was an effort to discredit
the Jews.<a id="FNanchor_C6-970" href="#Footnote_C6-970" class="fnanchor">C6-970</a> Senator testified that when Ruby returned to the apartment,
he began to discuss the Weissman advertisement and also a signboard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
he had seen in Dallas urging that Chief Justice Earl Warren
be impeached.<a id="FNanchor_C6-971" href="#Footnote_C6-971" class="fnanchor">C6-971</a> Shortly thereafter, Ruby telephoned Larry Crafard
at the Carousel Club.<a id="FNanchor_C6-972" href="#Footnote_C6-972" class="fnanchor">C6-972</a> He told Crafard to meet him and Senator
at the Nichols Garage adjacent to the Carousel Club and to bring a
Polaroid camera kept in the club.<a id="FNanchor_C6-973" href="#Footnote_C6-973" class="fnanchor">C6-973</a> After Crafard joined Ruby and
Senator, the three men drove to the “Impeach Earl Warren”
sign near Hall Avenue and Central Expressway in Dallas. There
Ruby instructed Crafard to take three photographs of the billboard.
Believing that the sign and the Weissman newspaper ad might somehow
be connected, Ruby noted on the back of an envelope a name and
post office box number that appeared on the sign.<a id="FNanchor_C6-974" href="#Footnote_C6-974" class="fnanchor">C6-974</a> According to
George Senator:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * when he was looking at the sign and taking pictures
of it, and the newspaper ad, * * * this is where he really wanted
to know the whys or why these things had to be out. He is trying
to combine these two together, which I did hear him say, “This
is the work of the John Birch Society or the Communist Party
or maybe a combination of both.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-975" href="#Footnote_C6-975" class="fnanchor">C6-975</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Pursuing a possible connection between the billboard and the newspaper
advertisement, Ruby drove to the post office and asked a postal
employee for the name of the man who had rented the box indicated on
the billboard, but the employee said that he could not provide such
information. Ruby inspected the box, however, and was upset to
find it stuffed with mail.<a id="FNanchor_C6-976" href="#Footnote_C6-976" class="fnanchor">C6-976</a> The three men then drove to a coffeeshop
where Ruby continued to discuss the two advertisements. After
about 30 minutes, they left the coffeeshop. Crafard was taken to
the Carousel Club; Ruby and Senator returned to their apartment,<a id="FNanchor_C6-977" href="#Footnote_C6-977" class="fnanchor">C6-977</a>
and Ruby retired at about 6 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-978" href="#Footnote_C6-978" class="fnanchor">C6-978</a></p>

<p><i>The morning and afternoon of November 23.</i>—At 8 or 8:30 a.m.
Crafard, who had been asked to feed Ruby’s dogs, telephoned Ruby
at his apartment to inquire about food for the animals.<a id="FNanchor_C6-979" href="#Footnote_C6-979" class="fnanchor">C6-979</a> Ruby
forgot that he had told Crafard he did not plan to go to bed and reprimanded
Crafard for waking him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-980" href="#Footnote_C6-980" class="fnanchor">C6-980</a> A few hours thereafter Crafard
assembled his few belongings, took from the Carousel cash register $5
of money due him from Ruby, left a receipt and thank-you note, and
began hitchhiking to Michigan. Later that day, Andrew Armstrong
found the note and telephoned Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-981" href="#Footnote_C6-981" class="fnanchor">C6-981</a></p>

<p>Ruby apparently did not return to bed following Crafard’s call.
During the morning hours, he watched a rabbi deliver on television
a moving eulogy of President Kennedy.<a id="FNanchor_C6-982" href="#Footnote_C6-982" class="fnanchor">C6-982</a> According to Ruby, the
rabbi:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">went ahead and eulogized that here is a man that fought in every
battle, went to every country, and had to come back to his own
country to be shot in the back [starts crying] * * *. That created
a tremendous emotional feeling for me, the way he said that.
Prior to all the other times, I was carried away.<a id="FNanchor_C6-983" href="#Footnote_C6-983" class="fnanchor">C6-983</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
An employee from the Carousel Club who telephoned Ruby during
the morning remembered that his “voice was shaking” when he spoke
of the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-984" href="#Footnote_C6-984" class="fnanchor">C6-984</a></p>

<p>Ruby has stated that, upon leaving his apartment some time between
noon and 1:30 p.m., he drove to Dealey Plaza where a police officer,
who noted Ruby’s solemnity, pointed out to him the window from
which the rifleshots had been fired the day before.<a id="FNanchor_C6-985" href="#Footnote_C6-985" class="fnanchor">C6-985</a> Ruby related
that he inspected the wreaths that had been placed in memory of the
President and became filled with emotion while speaking with the
police officer.<a id="FNanchor_C6-986" href="#Footnote_C6-986" class="fnanchor">C6-986</a> Ruby introduced himself to a reporter for radio
station KRLD who was working inside a mobile news unit at the
plaza; the newsman mentioned to Ruby that he had heard of Ruby’s
help to KLIF in obtaining an interview with Henry Wade, and Ruby
pointed out to the reporter that Capt. J. Will Fritz and Chief Curry
were then in the vicinity. Thereafter, the newsman interviewed and
photographed the officers.<a id="FNanchor_C6-987" href="#Footnote_C6-987" class="fnanchor">C6-987</a> Ruby said that he next drove home and
returned downtown to Sol’s Turf Bar on Commerce Street.<a id="FNanchor_C6-988" href="#Footnote_C6-988" class="fnanchor">C6-988</a></p>

<p>The evidence indicated, however, that sometime after leaving Dealey
Plaza, Ruby went to the Nichols Parking Garage adjacent to the
Carousel Club, where he was seen by Garnett C. Hallmark, general
manager of the garage, and Tom Brown, an attendant. Brown
believed that at about 1:30 p.m. he heard Ruby mention Chief Curry’s
name in a telephone conversation from the garage. Brown also recalled
that, before finally departing, Ruby asked him to inform
acquaintances whom he expected to stop by the garage that the Carousel
would be closed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-989" href="#Footnote_C6-989" class="fnanchor">C6-989</a> Hallmark testified that Ruby drove into the
garage at about 3 p.m., walked to the telephone, inquired whether
or not a competing burlesque club would be closed that night, and
told Hallmark that he (Ruby) was “acting like a reporter.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-990" href="#Footnote_C6-990" class="fnanchor">C6-990</a>
Hallmark then heard Ruby address someone at the other end of the
telephone as “Ken” and caught portions of a conversation concerning
the transfer of Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-991" href="#Footnote_C6-991" class="fnanchor">C6-991</a> Hallmark said Ruby never called
Oswald by name but used the pronoun “he” and remarked to the
recipient of the call, “you know I’ll be there.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-992" href="#Footnote_C6-992" class="fnanchor">C6-992</a></p>

<p>Ken Dowe, a KLIF announcer, to whom Ruby made at least
two telephone calls within a short span of time Saturday afternoon,
confirmed that he was probably the person to whom Hallmark and
Brown overheard Ruby speaking. In one call to Dowe, Ruby asked
whether the station knew when Oswald would be moved; and, in
another, he stated he was going to attempt to locate Henry Wade.<a id="FNanchor_C6-993" href="#Footnote_C6-993" class="fnanchor">C6-993</a>
After Ruby finished his calls, he walked onto Commerce Street, passed
the Carousel Club, and returned a few minutes later to get his car.<a id="FNanchor_C6-994" href="#Footnote_C6-994" class="fnanchor">C6-994</a></p>

<p>Ruby’s comment that he was “acting like a reporter” and that he
would be at the Oswald transfer suggests that Ruby may have spent
part of Saturday afternoon shuttling back and forth from the Police
and Courts Building to Dealey Plaza. Such activity would explain
the fact that Tom Brown at the Nichols Garage believed he saw Ruby
at 1:30 p.m. while Garnett Hallmark placed Ruby at the garage at
3 p.m. It would also explain Ken Dowe’s receiving two phone calls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
from Ruby. The testimony of five news reporters supports the possibility
that Ruby was at the Police and Courts Building Saturday
afternoon.<a id="FNanchor_C6-995" href="#Footnote_C6-995" class="fnanchor">C6-995</a> One stated that Ruby provided sandwiches for newsmen
on duty there Saturday afternoon, although no news representative
has mentioned personally receiving such sandwiches.<a id="FNanchor_C6-996" href="#Footnote_C6-996" class="fnanchor">C6-996</a> Another testified
that he received a card to the Carousel Club from Ruby about 4
p.m. that day at the police station.<a id="FNanchor_C6-997" href="#Footnote_C6-997" class="fnanchor">C6-997</a> A third believed he saw Ruby
enter an office in which Henry Wade was working, but no one else
reported a similar event.<a id="FNanchor_C6-998" href="#Footnote_C6-998" class="fnanchor">C6-998</a> The remaining two witnesses mentioned
no specific activities.<a id="FNanchor_C6-999" href="#Footnote_C6-999" class="fnanchor">C6-999</a> None of the persons who believed they saw
Ruby at the police department on Saturday had known him previously,
and no police officer has reported Ruby’s presence on that
day. Ruby has not mentioned such a visit. The Commission, therefore,
reached no firm conclusion as to whether or not Ruby visited
the Dallas Police Department on Saturday.</p>

<p>Shortly after 3 p.m. Ruby went to Sol’s Turf Bar on Commerce
Street where he remained for about 45 minutes. Ruby, a nondrinker,
stated that he visited Sol’s for the purpose of talking with his accountant,
who customarily prepared the bar’s payroll on Saturday
afternoon. The accountant testified, however, that he saw Ruby only
briefly and mentioned no business conversation with Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1000" href="#Footnote_C6-1000" class="fnanchor">C6-1000</a> Ruby
was first noticed at the Turf Bar by jeweler Frank Bellochio, who,
after seeing Ruby, began to berate the people of Dallas for the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1001" href="#Footnote_C6-1001" class="fnanchor">C6-1001</a>
Ruby disagreed and, when Bellochio said he might close
his jewelry business and leave Dallas, Ruby attempted to calm him,
saying that there were many good citizens in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1002" href="#Footnote_C6-1002" class="fnanchor">C6-1002</a> In response,
Bellochio pointed to a copy of the Bernard Weissman advertisement.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1003" href="#Footnote_C6-1003" class="fnanchor">C6-1003</a>
To Bellochio’s bewilderment, Ruby then said he believed that
the advertisement was the work of a group attempting to create anti-Semitic
feelings in Dallas and that he had learned from the Dallas
Morning News that the ad had been paid for partly in cash.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1004" href="#Footnote_C6-1004" class="fnanchor">C6-1004</a> Ruby
thereupon produced one of the photographs he had taken Saturday
morning of the “Impeach Earl Warren” sign and excitedly began to
rail against the sign as if he agreed with Bellochio’s original criticism
of Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1005" href="#Footnote_C6-1005" class="fnanchor">C6-1005</a> He “seemed to be taking two sides—he wasn’t coherent,”
Bellochio testified.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1006" href="#Footnote_C6-1006" class="fnanchor">C6-1006</a> When Bellochio saw Ruby’s photographs,
which Bellochio thought supported his argument against
Dallas, he walked to the front of the bar and showed them to Tom
Apple, with whom he had been previously arguing. In Apple’s
presence, Bellochio asked Ruby for one of the pictures but Ruby
refused, mentioning that he regarded the pictures as a scoop.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1007" href="#Footnote_C6-1007" class="fnanchor">C6-1007</a>
Bellochio testified: “I spoke to Tom and said a few more words to
Tom, and Ruby was gone—never said ‘Goodbye’ or ‘I’ll be seeing
you.’”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1008" href="#Footnote_C6-1008" class="fnanchor">C6-1008</a></p>

<p>Ruby may have left in order to telephone Stanley Kaufman, a
friend and attorney who had represented him in civil matters.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1009" href="#Footnote_C6-1009" class="fnanchor">C6-1009</a>
Kaufman testified that, at approximately 4 p.m., Ruby called him
about the Bernard Weissman advertisement. According to Kaufman,
“Jack was particularly impressed with the [black] border as being a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
tipoff of some sort—that this man knew the President was going to
be assassinated * * *.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1010" href="#Footnote_C6-1010" class="fnanchor">C6-1010</a> Ruby told Kaufman that he had tried to
locate Weissman by going to the post office and said that he was attempting
to be helpful to law enforcement authorities.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1011" href="#Footnote_C6-1011" class="fnanchor">C6-1011</a></p>

<p>Considerable confusion exists as to the place from which Ruby placed
the call to Kaufman and as to his activities after leaving Sol’s Turf
Bar. Eva Grant stated that the call was made from her apartment
about 4 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1012" href="#Footnote_C6-1012" class="fnanchor">C6-1012</a> Ruby, however, believed it was made from the Turf
Bar. He stated that from the Turf Bar he went to the Carousel and
then home and has not provided additional details on his activities
during the hours from about 4 to 9:30 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1013" href="#Footnote_C6-1013" class="fnanchor">C6-1013</a> Robert Larkin saw him
downtown at about 6 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1014" href="#Footnote_C6-1014" class="fnanchor">C6-1014</a> and Andrew Armstrong testified that
Ruby visited the Carousel Club between 6 and 7 p.m. and remained
about an hour.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1015" href="#Footnote_C6-1015" class="fnanchor">C6-1015</a></p>

<p><i>At Eva Grant’s apartment Saturday evening.</i>—Eva Grant believed
that, for most of the period from 4 until 8 p.m., Ruby was at her apartment.
Mrs. Grant testified that her brother was still disturbed about
the Weissman advertisement when he arrived, showed her the
photograph of the Warren sign, and recounted his argument with
Bellochio about the city of Dallas. Still curious as to whether or not
Weissman was Jewish, Mrs. Grant asked her brother whether he had
been able to find the name Bernard Weissman in the Dallas city
directory, and Ruby said he had not. Their doubts about Weissman’s
existence having been confirmed, both began to speculate that the
Weissman ad and the Warren sign were the work of either “Commies
or the Birchers,” and were designed to discredit the Jews.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1016" href="#Footnote_C6-1016" class="fnanchor">C6-1016</a> Apparently
in the midst of that conversation Ruby telephoned Russ Knight
at KLIF and, according to Knight, asked who Earl Warren was.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1017" href="#Footnote_C6-1017" class="fnanchor">C6-1017</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Grant has testified that Ruby eventually retired to her bedroom
where he made telephone calls and slept.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1018" href="#Footnote_C6-1018" class="fnanchor">C6-1018</a> About 8:30 p.m., Ruby
telephoned to Thomas J. O’Grady, a friend and former Dallas police
officer who had once worked for Ruby as a bouncer. To O’Grady,
Ruby mentioned closing the Carousel Club, criticized his competitors
for remaining open, and complained about the “Impeach Earl Warren”
sign.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1019" href="#Footnote_C6-1019" class="fnanchor">C6-1019</a></p>

<p><i>Saturday evening at Ruby’s apartment.</i>—By 9:30 p.m., Ruby had
apparently returned to his apartment where he received a telephone
call from one of his striptease dancers, Karen Bennett Carlin, who,
together with her husband, had been driven from Fort Worth to Dallas
that evening by another dancer, Nancy Powell.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1020" href="#Footnote_C6-1020" class="fnanchor">C6-1020</a> All three had
stopped at the Colony Club, a burlesque nightclub which competed
with the Carousel.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1021" href="#Footnote_C6-1021" class="fnanchor">C6-1021</a> Mrs. Carlin testified that, in need of money, she
telephoned Ruby, asked whether the Carousel would be open that
night, and requested part of her salary.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1022" href="#Footnote_C6-1022" class="fnanchor">C6-1022</a> According to Mrs. Carlin,
Ruby became angry at the suggestion that the Carousel Club might be
open for business but told her he would come to the Carousel in about
an hour.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1023" href="#Footnote_C6-1023" class="fnanchor">C6-1023</a></p>

<p>Thereafter, in a depressed mood, Ruby telephoned his sister Eva
Grant, who suggested he visit a friend.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1024" href="#Footnote_C6-1024" class="fnanchor">C6-1024</a> Possibly in response to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
that suggestion, Ruby called Lawrence Meyers, a friend from Chicago
with whom he had visited two nights previously.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1025" href="#Footnote_C6-1025" class="fnanchor">C6-1025</a> Meyers
testified that, during their telephone conversation, Ruby asked him
what he thought of this “terrible thing,” Ruby then began to criticize
his competitors, Abe and Barney Weinstein, for failing to close their
clubs on Saturday night. In the course of his conversation about the
Weinsteins and the assassination, Ruby said “I’ve got to do something
about this.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1026" href="#Footnote_C6-1026" class="fnanchor">C6-1026</a> Meyers initially understood that remark to refer to
the Weinsteins. Upon reflection after Oswald was shot, Meyers was
uncertain whether Ruby was referring to his competitors, or to the
assassination of President Kennedy; for Ruby had also spoken at
length about Mrs. Kennedy and had repeated “those poor people,
those poor people.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1027" href="#Footnote_C6-1027" class="fnanchor">C6-1027</a> At the conclusion of their conversation,
Meyers declined Ruby’s invitation to join him for a cup of coffee but
invited Ruby to join him at the motel. When Ruby also declined, the
two agreed to meet for dinner the following evening.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1028" href="#Footnote_C6-1028" class="fnanchor">C6-1028</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Karen Carlin and her husband grew anxious over
Ruby’s failure to appear with the money they had requested.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1029" href="#Footnote_C6-1029" class="fnanchor">C6-1029</a>
After a substantial wait, they returned together to the Nichols Garage
where Mr. Carlin telephoned to Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1030" href="#Footnote_C6-1030" class="fnanchor">C6-1030</a> Carlin testified that he
told Ruby they needed money in order to return to Fort Worth<a id="FNanchor_C6-1031" href="#Footnote_C6-1031" class="fnanchor">C6-1031</a>
although Nancy Powell testified that she drove the Carlins home that
evening.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1032" href="#Footnote_C6-1032" class="fnanchor">C6-1032</a> Agreeing to advance a small sum, Ruby asked to speak
to Mrs. Carlin, who claimed that Ruby told her that if she needed
more money she should call him on Sunday.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1033" href="#Footnote_C6-1033" class="fnanchor">C6-1033</a> Thereafter, at Ruby’s
request, garage attendant Huey Reeves gave Mrs. Carlin $5, and she
signed with her stage name “Little Lynn” a receipt which Reeves time-stamped
10:33 p.m., November 23.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1034" href="#Footnote_C6-1034" class="fnanchor">C6-1034</a> (See Commission Exhibit No.
1476, <a href="#Page_351">p. 351</a>.)</p>

<p>Inconsistent testimony was developed regarding Ruby’s activities
during the next 45 minutes. Eva Grant testified that she did not see
her brother on Saturday night after 8 p.m. and has denied calling
Ralph Paul herself that night.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1035" href="#Footnote_C6-1035" class="fnanchor">C6-1035</a> Nonetheless, telephone company
records revealed that at 10:44 p.m. a call was made to Ralph Paul’s
Bull Pen Drive-In in Arlington, Tex., from Mrs. Grant’s apartment.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1036" href="#Footnote_C6-1036" class="fnanchor">C6-1036</a>
It was the only call to Paul from her apartment on Friday or Saturday;<a id="FNanchor_C6-1037" href="#Footnote_C6-1037" class="fnanchor">C6-1037</a>
she recalled her brother making such a call that weekend;<a id="FNanchor_C6-1038" href="#Footnote_C6-1038" class="fnanchor">C6-1038</a>
and Ralph Paul has testified that Ruby telephoned him Saturday
night from Eva Grant’s apartment and said he and his sister were
there crying.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1039" href="#Footnote_C6-1039" class="fnanchor">C6-1039</a></p>

<p>Nineteen-year-old Wanda Helmick, a former waitress at the Bull
Pen Drive-In, first reported in June, 1964 that some time during the
evening she saw the cashier answer the Bull Pan’s pay telephone and
heard her call out to Paul, “It is for you. It is Jack.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1040" href="#Footnote_C6-1040" class="fnanchor">C6-1040</a> Mrs. Helmick
claimed she overheard Paul, speaking on the telephone, mention
something about a gun which, she understood from Paul’s conversation,
the caller had in his possession. She said she also heard Paul
exclaim “Are you crazy?”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1041" href="#Footnote_C6-1041" class="fnanchor">C6-1041</a> She provided no other details of the
conversation. Mrs. Helmick claimed that on Sunday, November 24,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
after Oswald had been shot, she heard Paul repeat the substance of the
call to other employees as she had related it and that Paul said Ruby
was the caller.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1042" href="#Footnote_C6-1042" class="fnanchor">C6-1042</a> Ralph Paul denied the allegations of Mrs.
Helmick.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1043" href="#Footnote_C6-1043" class="fnanchor">C6-1043</a> Both Paul and Mrs. Helmick agreed that Paul went
home soon after the call, apparently about 11 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1044" href="#Footnote_C6-1044" class="fnanchor">C6-1044</a></p>

<p>Shortly after 11 p.m., Ruby arrived at the Nichols Garage where he
repaid Huey Reeves and obtained the receipt Mrs. Carlin had
signed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1045" href="#Footnote_C6-1045" class="fnanchor">C6-1045</a> Outside the Carousel, Ruby exchanged greetings with
Police Officer Harry Olsen and Kay Coleman, whom he had seen late
the previous night.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1046" href="#Footnote_C6-1046" class="fnanchor">C6-1046</a> Going upstairs to the club, Ruby made a
series of five brief long-distance phone calls, the first being to the
Bull Pen Drive-In at 11:18 p.m. and lasting only 1 minute.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1047" href="#Footnote_C6-1047" class="fnanchor">C6-1047</a> Apparently
unable to reach Paul there, Ruby telephoned Paul’s home in
Arlington, Tex., for 3 minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1048" href="#Footnote_C6-1048" class="fnanchor">C6-1048</a> A third call was placed at 11:36
p.m. for 2 minutes, again to Paul’s home.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1049" href="#Footnote_C6-1049" class="fnanchor">C6-1049</a> At 11:44 p.m. Ruby
telephoned Breck Wall, a friend and entertainer who had gone to
Galveston, Tex., when his show in Dallas suspended its performance
out of respect to President Kennedy. The call lasted 2 minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1050" href="#Footnote_C6-1050" class="fnanchor">C6-1050</a>
Thereafter, Ruby immediately placed a 1-minute phone call to Paul’s
home.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1051" href="#Footnote_C6-1051" class="fnanchor">C6-1051</a></p>

<p>Although Ruby has mentioned those calls, he has not provided
details to the Commission; however, he has denied ever indicating to
Paul or Wall that he was going to shoot Oswald and has said he did not
consider such action until Sunday morning.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1052" href="#Footnote_C6-1052" class="fnanchor">C6-1052</a> Ralph Paul did not
mention the late evening calls in his interview with FBI agents on
November 24, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1053" href="#Footnote_C6-1053" class="fnanchor">C6-1053</a> Later Paul testified that Ruby called him from
downtown to say that nobody was doing any business.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1054" href="#Footnote_C6-1054" class="fnanchor">C6-1054</a> Breck Wall
testified that Ruby called him to determine whether or not the American
Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA), which represented striptease
dancers in Dallas, had met concerning a dispute Ruby was having
with the union.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1055" href="#Footnote_C6-1055" class="fnanchor">C6-1055</a> Ruby’s major difference with AGVA during the
preceding 2 weeks had involved what Ruby considered to be AGVA’s
failure to enforce against his 2 competitors, Abe and Barney Weinstein,
AGVA’s ban on “striptease contests” and performances by
“amateurs.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1056" href="#Footnote_C6-1056" class="fnanchor">C6-1056</a> As recently as Wednesday, November 20, Ruby had
telephoned an AGVA representative in Chicago about that complaint
and earlier in November he had unsuccessfully sought to obtain assistance
from a San Francisco gambler and a Chicagoan reputed for his
heavyhanded union activities.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1057" href="#Footnote_C6-1057" class="fnanchor">C6-1057</a> Wall testified that Ruby “was very
upset the President was assassinated and he called Abe Weinstein or
Bernie Weinstein * * * some names for staying open * * *.” Wall
added, “he was very upset * * * that they did not have the decency
to close on such a day and he thought out of respect they should
close.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1058" href="#Footnote_C6-1058" class="fnanchor">C6-1058</a></p>

<p><i>Ruby’s activities after midnight.</i>—After completing the series of
calls to Paul and Wall at 11:48 p.m., Ruby went to the Pago Club,
about a 10-minute drive from the Carousel Club.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1059" href="#Footnote_C6-1059" class="fnanchor">C6-1059</a> He took a table
near the middle of the club and, after ordering a Coke, asked the waitress
in a disapproving tone, “Why are you open?”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1060" href="#Footnote_C6-1060" class="fnanchor">C6-1060</a> When Robert
Norton, the club’s manager, joined Ruby a few minutes later he expressed
to Ruby his concern as to whether or not it was proper to
operate the Pago Club that evening. Ruby indicated that the Carousel
was closed but did not criticize Norton for remaining open.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1061" href="#Footnote_C6-1061" class="fnanchor">C6-1061</a>
Norton raised the topic of President Kennedy’s death and said, “[W]e
couldn’t do enough to the person that [did] this sort of thing.”
Norton added, however, that “Nobody has the right to take the life
of another one.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1062" href="#Footnote_C6-1062" class="fnanchor">C6-1062</a> Ruby expressed no strong opinion, and closed the
conversation by saying he was going home because he was tired.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1063" href="#Footnote_C6-1063" class="fnanchor">C6-1063</a>
Later, Ruby told the Commission: “he knew something was wrong
with me in the certain mood I was in.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-1064" href="#Footnote_C6-1064" class="fnanchor">C6-1064</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
Ruby testified that he went home after speaking with Norton and
went to bed about 1:30 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1065" href="#Footnote_C6-1065" class="fnanchor">C6-1065</a> By that time, George Senator claimed,
he had retired for the night and did not remember Ruby’s return.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1066" href="#Footnote_C6-1066" class="fnanchor">C6-1066</a>
Eva Grant testified that her brother telephoned her at about 12:45
a.m. to learn how she was feeling.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1067" href="#Footnote_C6-1067" class="fnanchor">C6-1067</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday morning.</i>—Ruby’s activities on Sunday morning are the
subject of conflicting testimony. George Senator believed that Ruby
did not rise until 9 or 9:30 a.m.;<a id="FNanchor_C6-1068" href="#Footnote_C6-1068" class="fnanchor">C6-1068</a> both Ruby and Senator maintained
that Ruby did not leave their apartment until shortly before
11:00 a.m., and two other witnesses have provided testimony which
supports that account of Ruby’s whereabouts.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1069" href="#Footnote_C6-1069" class="fnanchor">C6-1069</a> On the other hand,
three WBAP-TV television technicians—Warren Richey, John Smith,
and Ira Walker—believed they saw Ruby near the Police and Courts
Building at various times between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1070" href="#Footnote_C6-1070" class="fnanchor">C6-1070</a> But there are
substantial reasons to doubt the accuracy of their identifications.
None had ever seen Ruby on a prior occasion. None looked for an
extended period at the man believed to be Ruby,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1071" href="#Footnote_C6-1071" class="fnanchor">C6-1071</a> and all were
occupied with their duties and had no reason to remember the man’s
appearance until they saw Ruby’s picture on television.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1072" href="#Footnote_C6-1072" class="fnanchor">C6-1072</a></p>

<p>Smith, for one, was not entirely positive about his identification of
Ruby as the man he saw;<a id="FNanchor_C6-1073" href="#Footnote_C6-1073" class="fnanchor">C6-1073</a> and Richey was looking down from atop
a TV mobile unit when he observed on the sidewalk the man he believed
was Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1074" href="#Footnote_C6-1074" class="fnanchor">C6-1074</a> In addition, Richey and Smith provided descriptions
of Ruby which differ substantially from information about Ruby
gathered from other sources. Smith described the man he saw as being
an “unkempt person that possibly could have slept with his clothes
on * * *.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1075" href="#Footnote_C6-1075" class="fnanchor">C6-1075</a> Ruby was characteristically clean and well groomed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1076" href="#Footnote_C6-1076" class="fnanchor">C6-1076</a>
In fact, Senator testified that Ruby shaved and dressed before leaving
their apartment that morning, and at the time Ruby shot Oswald he
was dressed in a hat and business suit.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1077" href="#Footnote_C6-1077" class="fnanchor">C6-1077</a> Richey described Ruby as
wearing a grayish overcoat,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1078" href="#Footnote_C6-1078" class="fnanchor">C6-1078</a> while investigation indicated that
Ruby did not own an overcoat and was not wearing one at the time of
the shooting.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1079" href="#Footnote_C6-1079" class="fnanchor">C6-1079</a> (See Pappas Deposition Exhibit No. 1, <a href="#Page_356">p. 356</a>.) Although
Walker’s identification of Ruby is the most positive, his certainty
must be contrasted with the indefinite identification made by
Smith, who had seen the man on one additional occasion.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1080" href="#Footnote_C6-1080" class="fnanchor">C6-1080</a> Both
Smith and Walker saw a man resembling Ruby when the man, on two
occasions, looked through the window of their mobile news unit and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
once asked whether Oswald had been transferred. Both saw only
the man’s head, and Smith was closer to the window; yet Smith would
not state positively that the man was Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1081" href="#Footnote_C6-1081" class="fnanchor">C6-1081</a> Finally, video tapes
of scenes on Sunday morning near the NBC van show a man close
to the Commerce Street entrance who might have been mistaken for
Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1082" href="#Footnote_C6-1082" class="fnanchor">C6-1082</a></p>

<p>George Senator said that when he arose, before 9 a.m., he began
to do his laundry in the basement of the apartment building while
Ruby slept.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1083" href="#Footnote_C6-1083" class="fnanchor">C6-1083</a> During Senator’s absence, Ruby received a telephone
call from his cleaning lady, Mrs. Elnora Pitts, who testified that she
called sometime between 8:30 and 9 a.m. to learn whether Ruby wanted
her to clean his apartment that day.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1084" href="#Footnote_C6-1084" class="fnanchor">C6-1084</a> Mrs. Pitts remembered that
Ruby “sounded terrible strange to me.” She said that “there was something
wrong with him the way he was talking to me.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1085" href="#Footnote_C6-1085" class="fnanchor">C6-1085</a> Mrs. Pitts
explained that, although she had regularly been cleaning Ruby’s
apartment on Sundays, Ruby seemed not to comprehend who she was or
the reason for her call and required her to repeat herself several
times.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1086" href="#Footnote_C6-1086" class="fnanchor">C6-1086</a> As Senator returned to the apartment after the call, he was
apparently mistaken for Ruby by a neighbor, Sidney Evans, Jr.
Evans had never seen Ruby before but recalled observing a man resembling
Ruby, clad in trousers and T-shirt, walk upstairs from the
“washateria” in the basement of their building and enter Ruby’s suite
with a load of laundry. Later in the morning, Malcolm Slaughter who
shared an apartment with Evans, saw an individual, similarly clad, on
the same floor as Ruby’s apartment.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1087" href="#Footnote_C6-1087" class="fnanchor">C6-1087</a> Senator stated that it was not
Ruby’s custom to do his own washing and that Ruby did not do so that
morning.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1088" href="#Footnote_C6-1088" class="fnanchor">C6-1088</a></p>

<p>While Senator was in the apartment, Ruby watched television, made
himself coffee and scrambled eggs, and received, at 10:19 a.m., a telephone
call from his entertainer, Karen Carlin.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1089" href="#Footnote_C6-1089" class="fnanchor">C6-1089</a> Mrs. Carlin testified
that in her telephone conversation she asked Ruby for $25 inasmuch
as her rent was delinquent and she needed groceries.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1090" href="#Footnote_C6-1090" class="fnanchor">C6-1090</a> She
said that Ruby, who seemed upset, mentioned that he was going downtown
anyway and that he would send the money from the Western
Union office.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1091" href="#Footnote_C6-1091" class="fnanchor">C6-1091</a> According to George Senator, Ruby then probably
took a half hour or more to bathe and dress.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1092" href="#Footnote_C6-1092" class="fnanchor">C6-1092</a></p>

<p>Supporting the accounts given by Mrs. Carlin and Mrs. Pitts of
Ruby’s emotional state, Senator testified that during the morning
Ruby:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * was even mumbling, which I didn’t understand. And right
after breakfast he got dressed. Then after he got dressed he was
pacing the floor from the living room to the bedroom, from the
bedroom to the living room, and his lips were going. What he
was jabbering I don’t know. But he was really pacing.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1093" href="#Footnote_C6-1093" class="fnanchor">C6-1093</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Ruby has described to the Commission his own emotions of Sunday
morning as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * Sunday morning * * * [I] saw a letter to Caroline, two
columns about a 16-inch area. Someone had written a letter to
Caroline. The most heartbreaking letter. I don’t remember the
contents. * * * alongside that letter on the same sheet of paper
was a small comment in the newspaper that, I don’t know how
it was stated, that Mrs. Kennedy may have to come back for the
trial of Lee Harvey Oswald. * * *</p>

<p>I don’t know what bug got ahold of me. I don’t know what it
is, but I am going to tell the truth word for word.</p>

<p>I am taking a pill called Preludin. It is a harmless pill, and it
is very easy to get in the drugstore. It isn’t a highly prescribed
pill. I use it for dieting.</p>

<p>I don’t partake of that much food. I think that was a stimulus
to give me an emotional feeling that suddenly I felt, which was
so stupid, that I wanted to show my love for our faith, being of
the Jewish faith, and I never used the term and I don’t want to
go into that—suddenly the feeling, the emotional feeling came
within me that someone owed this debt to our beloved President
to save her the ordeal of coming back. I don’t know why that
came through my mind.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1094" href="#Footnote_C6-1094" class="fnanchor">C6-1094</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sunday morning trip to police department.</i>—Leaving his apartment
a few minutes before 11 a.m., Ruby went to his automobile taking
with him his dachshund, Sheba, and a portable radio.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1095" href="#Footnote_C6-1095" class="fnanchor">C6-1095</a> He
placed in his pocket a revolver which he routinely carried in a bank
moneybag in the trunk of his car.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1096" href="#Footnote_C6-1096" class="fnanchor">C6-1096</a> Listening to the radio, he drove
downtown, according to his own testimony, by a route that took him
past Dealey Plaza where he observed the scattered wreaths. Ruby
related that he noted the crowd that had gathered outside the county
jail and assumed that Oswald had already been transferred. However,
when he passed the Main Street side of the Police and Courts
Building, which is situated on the same block as the Western Union
office, he also noted the crowd that was gathered outside that building.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1097" href="#Footnote_C6-1097" class="fnanchor">C6-1097</a>
Normal driving time for the trip from his apartment would
have been about 15 minutes, but Ruby’s possible haste and the slow
movement of traffic through Dealey Plaza make a reliable estimate
difficult.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1098" href="#Footnote_C6-1098" class="fnanchor">C6-1098</a></p>

<p>Ruby parked his car in a lot directly across the street from the
Western Union office. He apparently placed his keys and billfold in
the trunk of the car, then locked the trunk, which contained approximately
$1,000 in cash, and placed the trunk key in the glove compartment
of the car. He did not lock the car doors.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1099" href="#Footnote_C6-1099" class="fnanchor">C6-1099</a></p>

<p>With his revolver, more than $2,000 in cash, and no personal identification,
Ruby walked from the parking lot across the street to the
Western Union office where he filled out forms for sending $25 by
telegraph to Karen Carlin.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1100" href="#Footnote_C6-1100" class="fnanchor">C6-1100</a> After waiting in line while one other
Western Union customer completed her business,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1101" href="#Footnote_C6-1101" class="fnanchor">C6-1101</a> Ruby paid for
the telegram and retained as a receipt one of three time-stamped documents
which show that the transaction was completed at almost exactly
11:17 a.m., c.s.t.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1102" href="#Footnote_C6-1102" class="fnanchor">C6-1102</a> (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 1476, 2420,
2421; D. Lane Deposition Exhibits Nos. 5118, 5119, <a href="#Page_351">p. 351</a>.) The
Western Union clerk who accepted Ruby’s order recalls that Ruby
promptly turned, walked out of the door onto Main Street, and proceeded
in the direction of the police department one block away.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1103" href="#Footnote_C6-1103" class="fnanchor">C6-1103</a>
The evidence set forth in chapter V indicates that Ruby entered the
police basement through the auto ramp from Main Street and stood
behind the front rank of newsmen and police officers who were crowded
together at the base of the ramp awaiting the transfer of Oswald to the
county jail.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1104" href="#Footnote_C6-1104" class="fnanchor">C6-1104</a> As Oswald emerged from a basement office at approximately
11:21 a.m., Ruby moved quickly forward and, without speaking,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1105" href="#Footnote_C6-1105" class="fnanchor">C6-1105</a>
fired one fatal shot into Oswald’s abdomen before being subdued
by a rush of police officers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-1106" href="#Footnote_C6-1106" class="fnanchor">C6-1106</a></p>

<i>Evaluation of activities.</i>—Examination of Ruby’s activities immediately
preceding and following the death of President Kennedy revealed
no sign of any conduct which suggests that he was involved in the
assassination. Prior to the tragedy, Ruby’s activities were routine.
Though persons who saw him between November 22 and 24 disagree
as to whether or not he appeared more upset than others around him,
his response to the assassination appears to have been one of genuine
shock and grief. His indications of concern over the possible effects of
the assassination upon his businesses seem consistent with other evidence
of his character.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1107" href="#Footnote_C6-1107" class="fnanchor">C6-1107</a> During the course of the weekend, Ruby
seems to have become obsessed with the possibility that the Impeach
Earl Warren sign and the Bernard Weissman ad were somehow connected
and related to the assassination. However, Ruby’s interest in
these public notices was openly expressed and, as discussed below, the
evidence reveals no connection between him and any political organization.</p>

<p>Examination of Larry Crafard’s sudden departure from Dallas
shortly before noon on November 23 does not suggest that Ruby was
involved in a conspiracy. To be sure, Crafard started hitchhiking to
Michigan, where members of his family lived, with only $7 in his
pocket.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1108" href="#Footnote_C6-1108" class="fnanchor">C6-1108</a> He made no attempt to communicate with law enforcement
officials after Oswald’s death;<a id="FNanchor_C6-1109" href="#Footnote_C6-1109" class="fnanchor">C6-1109</a> and a relative in Michigan
recalled that Crafard spoke very little of his association with Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1110" href="#Footnote_C6-1110" class="fnanchor">C6-1110</a>
When finally located by the FBI 6 days later, he stated that he left
Ruby’s employ because he did not wish to be subjected to further verbal
abuse by Ruby and that he went north to see his sister, from whom he
had not heard in some time.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1111" href="#Footnote_C6-1111" class="fnanchor">C6-1111</a></p>

<p>An investigation of Crafard’s unusual behavior confirms that his departure
from Dallas was innocent. After Oswald was shot, FBI
agents obtained from the Carousel Club an unmailed letter drafted by
Crafard to a relative in Michigan at least a week before the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1112" href="#Footnote_C6-1112" class="fnanchor">C6-1112</a>
The letter revealed that he was considering leaving Dallas at
that time.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1113" href="#Footnote_C6-1113" class="fnanchor">C6-1113</a> On November 17, Crafard, who had been receiving only
room, board, and incidental expenses, told Ruby he wanted to stop
working for him; however, Crafard agreed to remain when Ruby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
promised a salary.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1114" href="#Footnote_C6-1114" class="fnanchor">C6-1114</a> Then on the morning of November 23, Ruby
and Crafard had a minor altercation over the telephone.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1115" href="#Footnote_C6-1115" class="fnanchor">C6-1115</a> Although
Crafard did not voluntarily make known to the authorities his associations
with Ruby, he spoke freely and with verifiable accuracy when
questioned. The automobile driver who provided Crafard his first
ride from Dallas has been located; his statement generally conforms
with Crafard’s story; and he did not recall any unusual or troubled behavior
by Crafard during that ride.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1116" href="#Footnote_C6-1116" class="fnanchor">C6-1116</a></p>

<p>Although Crafard’s peremptory decision to leave Dallas might be
unusual for most persons, such behavior does not appear to have been
uncommon for him. His family residence had shifted frequently
among California, Michigan, and Oregon.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1117" href="#Footnote_C6-1117" class="fnanchor">C6-1117</a> During his 22 years, he
had earned his livelihood picking crops, working in carnivals, and
taking other odd jobs throughout the country.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1118" href="#Footnote_C6-1118" class="fnanchor">C6-1118</a> According to his
testimony, he had previously hitchhiked across the country with his
then wife and two infant children.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1119" href="#Footnote_C6-1119" class="fnanchor">C6-1119</a> Against such a background, it
is most probable that the factors motivating Crafard’s departure from
Dallas on November 23 were dissatisfaction with his existence in
Ruby’s employ, which he had never considered more than temporary,
Ruby’s decision to close his clubs for 3 days, the argument on Saturday
morning, and his own desire to see his relatives in Michigan. There is
no evidence to suggest any connection between Crafard’s departure and
the assassination of the President or the shooting of Oswald.</p>

<p>The allegations of Wanda Helmick raised speculation that Ruby’s
Saturday night phone calls to Ralph Paul and Breck Wall might have
concerned the shooting of Oswald, but investigation has found nothing
to indicate that the calls had conspiratorial implications. Paul was
a close friend, business associate, and adviser to Jack Ruby. Ruby
normally kept in close telephone contact with Paul, who had a substantial
sum of money committed to the Carousel Club.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1120" href="#Footnote_C6-1120" class="fnanchor">C6-1120</a> Paul explained
that Ruby called him Saturday evening once to point out his
ads, another time to say that nobody seemed to be doing any business in
downtown Dallas, and a third time to relate that both he and his sister
were crying over the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1121" href="#Footnote_C6-1121" class="fnanchor">C6-1121</a> Between two of those phone
calls to Paul, Ruby telephoned to Galveston, Tex., to speak with Wall,
a friend and former business associate who was an official of the American
Guild of Variety Artists. Wall related that during that call
Ruby criticized the Weinsteins for failing to close their clubs.</p>

<p>Having earlier made the same complaint to Lawrence Meyers to
whom he mentioned a need “to do something about this” it would have
been characteristic for Ruby to want to direct Breck Wall’s attention,
as an AGVA official, to what he regarded as the Weinsteins’ improper
conduct. The view that the calls to Wall and Paul could have had
conspiratorial implications also is belied in large measure by the conduct
of both men before and after the events of November 22-24. A
check of long-distance telephone records reveals no suspicious activity
by either man.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1122" href="#Footnote_C6-1122" class="fnanchor">C6-1122</a> Paul, in fact, is not known to have visited Dallas
during the weekend of the assassination except to appear openly in
an effort to arrange counsel for Ruby within a few hours of the attack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
on Oswald. Neither the FBI nor the CIA has been able to provide
any information that Ralph Paul or Breck Wall ever engaged
in any form of subversive activity.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1123" href="#Footnote_C6-1123" class="fnanchor">C6-1123</a></p>

<p>Moreover, Mrs. Helmick’s reliability is undermined by her failure
to report her information to any investigative official until June 9,
1964.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1124" href="#Footnote_C6-1124" class="fnanchor">C6-1124</a> Although a sister-in-law confirms that Mrs. Helmick wrote
her “something about a gun” shortly after the shooting,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1125" href="#Footnote_C6-1125" class="fnanchor">C6-1125</a> the only
mention of any statement by Paul which was included in a letter written
by Mrs. Helmick after the Ruby trial was that Paul believed Ruby
was “not in his right mind.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1126" href="#Footnote_C6-1126" class="fnanchor">C6-1126</a> No corroborating witness named by
Mrs. Helmick has been found who remembers the conversations she
mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1127" href="#Footnote_C6-1127" class="fnanchor">C6-1127</a> Both Ruby and Paul have denied that anything was
said, as Mrs. Helmick suggests, about a gun or an intent to shoot
Oswald, and Wall has stated that Ruby did not discuss such matters
with him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1128" href="#Footnote_C6-1128" class="fnanchor">C6-1128</a> Even if Mrs. Helmick is accurate the statements
ascribed to Paul indicate only that he may have heard of a possible
reference by Ruby to shooting Oswald. According to her, Paul’s
response was to exclaim “Are you crazy?” But under no circumstances
does the report of Mrs. Helmick or any other fact support a
belief that Paul or Wall was involved in the shooting of Oswald.</p>

<p>The Commission has conducted an investigation of the telephone
call Ruby received from Karen Carlin at 10:19 Sunday morning to
determine whether that call was prearranged for the purpose of conveying
information about the transfer of Oswald or to provide Ruby
an excuse for being near the police department. The Commission has
examined the records of long-distance telephone calls on Sunday morning
for Jack Ruby,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1129" href="#Footnote_C6-1129" class="fnanchor">C6-1129</a> the Carlins,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1130" href="#Footnote_C6-1130" class="fnanchor">C6-1130</a> the Dallas police,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1131" href="#Footnote_C6-1131" class="fnanchor">C6-1131</a> and several
other persons<a id="FNanchor_C6-1132" href="#Footnote_C6-1132" class="fnanchor">C6-1132</a> and has found no sign of any indirect communication
to Ruby through Mr. or Mrs. Carlin. No other evidence showing
any link between the Carlins and the shooting of Oswald has
been developed.</p>

<h4 id="hdr136">Ruby and Oswald Were Not Acquainted</h4>

<p>The possibility of a prior acquaintanceship between Ruby and
Oswald has been suggested by some persons who viewed the shooting
on television and believed that a look of recognition appeared on
Oswald’s face as Ruby moved toward him in the jail basement. The
Commission has examined the television tapes and movie films which
were made as Oswald moved through the basement and has observed
no facial expressions which can be interpreted as signifying recognition
of Ruby by Oswald. It is doubtful even that Oswald could have
seen Ruby sufficiently clearly to discern his identity since Oswald was
walking from a dark corridor into “the flash from the many cameras”
and the lights of TV cameramen which were “blinding.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1133" href="#Footnote_C6-1133" class="fnanchor">C6-1133</a> In addition
to such generalized suspicion, there have been numerous specific
allegations that Oswald was seen in the company of Ruby prior to
November 22, often at Ruby’s Carousel Club. All such allegations
have been investigated, but the Commission has found none which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
merits credence. In all but a few instances where the Commission was
able to trace the claim to its source, the person responsible for the report
either denied making it or admitted that he had no basis for the original
allegations.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1134" href="#Footnote_C6-1134" class="fnanchor">C6-1134</a> Frequently those responsible for the allegations
have proved to be persons of erratic memory or dubious mental stability.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1135" href="#Footnote_C6-1135" class="fnanchor">C6-1135</a>
In a few instances, the source of the story has remained unidentified,
and no person has come forward to substantiate the
rumor.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1136" href="#Footnote_C6-1136" class="fnanchor">C6-1136</a></p>

<p>The testimony of a few witnesses who claim to have seen Ruby with
a person who they feel may have been Oswald warrants further
comment. One such witness, Robert K. Patterson, a Dallas electronics
salesman, has stated that on a date established from sales records
as November 1, 1963, Ruby, accompanied by a man who resembled
Oswald, purchased some equipment at his business establishment.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1137" href="#Footnote_C6-1137" class="fnanchor">C6-1137</a>
However, Patterson did not claim positively that the man he saw was
Oswald,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1138" href="#Footnote_C6-1138" class="fnanchor">C6-1138</a> and two of his associates who were also present at the
time could not state that the man was Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1139" href="#Footnote_C6-1139" class="fnanchor">C6-1139</a> Other evidence indicates
that Ruby’s companion was Larry Crafard. Crafard, who
lived at the Carousel Club while working for Ruby from mid-October
until November 23, 1963, stated that sometime in late October or early
November he accompanied Ruby to an electronics store in connection
with the purchase of electronics equipment.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1140" href="#Footnote_C6-1140" class="fnanchor">C6-1140</a> Ruth Paine testified
that Crafard’s photograph bears a strong resemblance to Oswald;
and employment records of the Texas School Book Depository show
that Oswald worked a full day on November 1, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1141" href="#Footnote_C6-1141" class="fnanchor">C6-1141</a></p>

<p>William D. Crowe, Jr., a young nightclub master of ceremonies who
had worked for Ruby on three occasions and had begun a 4- or 5-week
engagement at the Carousel Club on November 11, 1963, was the first
person who reported a possible association between Ruby and
Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1142" href="#Footnote_C6-1142" class="fnanchor">C6-1142</a> While attempting to enter the Carousel Club on November
24, shortly after Oswald was shot, Crowe encountered two news
media representatives who were gathering information on Jack
Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1143" href="#Footnote_C6-1143" class="fnanchor">C6-1143</a> At that time, Crowe, who included a memory act in his
repertoire,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1144" href="#Footnote_C6-1144" class="fnanchor">C6-1144</a> mentioned the “possibility” that he had seen Oswald at
the Carousel Club.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1145" href="#Footnote_C6-1145" class="fnanchor">C6-1145</a> As a result he was asked to appear on television.
In Crowe’s own words, the story “started snowballing.” He testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They built up the memory thing and they built up the bit of
having seen Oswald there, and I never stated definitely, positively,
and they said that I did, and all in all, what they had in
the paper was hardly even close to what I told them.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1146" href="#Footnote_C6-1146" class="fnanchor">C6-1146</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Crowe added that his memory act involved a limited system which
did not, in fact, improve his memory and that his memory might not
even be as good as that of the average person. When asked how certain
he was that the man he saw was Oswald, Crowe testified:
“* * * the face seemed familiar as some faces do, and I had associated
him with a patron that I had seen in the club a week before. That
was about it.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-1147" href="#Footnote_C6-1147" class="fnanchor">C6-1147</a></p>

<p>A possible explanation for Crowe’s belief that Oswald’s face seemed
familiar was supplied by a freelance photographer, Eddie Rocco, who
had taken pictures at the Carousel Club for Ruby at about the time
Crowe was employed there. Rocco produced one of those photographs
which depicted a man who might have been mistaken for
Oswald by persons having no reason to remember the man at the time
they saw him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1148" href="#Footnote_C6-1148" class="fnanchor">C6-1148</a> When shown the Rocco photograph, Crowe said
that there was as strong a possibility that the man he recalled seeing
was the man in the photograph as there was that he was Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1149" href="#Footnote_C6-1149" class="fnanchor">C6-1149</a>
Crowe’s uncertainty was further underscored by his failure initially
to provide his information about Oswald to David Hoy, a news-media
friend whom Crowe telephoned in Evansville, Ind., less
than 20 minutes after Oswald was shot.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1150" href="#Footnote_C6-1150" class="fnanchor">C6-1150</a> By then the possible
recognition had occurred to Crowe,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1151" href="#Footnote_C6-1151" class="fnanchor">C6-1151</a> and Hoy said he was quite
surprised that Crowe had given the information first to other news
representatives instead of telling him in that early conversation.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1152" href="#Footnote_C6-1152" class="fnanchor">C6-1152</a></p>

<p>After Crowe’s identification had been publicized, four other persons
also reported seeing Oswald at the Carousel Club. One man said
he saw Ruby and Oswald seated at a table together and recalled that
the man resembling Oswald was addressed by a blond-haired waitress
as “Bettit” or “Pettit.” The witness was unable to give any description
of “Pettit” except that he was the man who had been shot
by Ruby. He could not describe the inside of the Carousel and was
unable to give a precise location for the club.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1153" href="#Footnote_C6-1153" class="fnanchor">C6-1153</a> Another witness,
a resident of Tennessee, related seeing a man resembling Oswald at
the Carousel Club on November 10.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1154" href="#Footnote_C6-1154" class="fnanchor">C6-1154</a> Ruth Paine has testified, however,
that Oswald spent the entire holiday weekend of November 9,
10, and 11 at her home in Irving, Tex.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1155" href="#Footnote_C6-1155" class="fnanchor">C6-1155</a> Two of Ruby’s former employees,
Karen Carlin and Billy Joe Willis, also believed they had
seen a person who resembled Oswald. Willis believed he saw the man
at the Carousel Club but did not think the man was Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1156" href="#Footnote_C6-1156" class="fnanchor">C6-1156</a>
Mrs. Carlin likewise was not certain that the man was Oswald nor
was she sure where she had seen him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1157" href="#Footnote_C6-1157" class="fnanchor">C6-1157</a> Neither reported any connection
between the man and Ruby. No other employees recalled
seeing Oswald or a person resembling him at the Carousel Club.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1158" href="#Footnote_C6-1158" class="fnanchor">C6-1158</a></p>

<p>Wilbryn Waldon (Robert) Litchfield II also claimed to have seen
at the Carousel Club a man resembling Oswald. Litchfield stated
that during a visit to the Carousel Club in late October or early
November 1963, he saw such a man enter Ruby’s office, apparently to
confer with Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1159" href="#Footnote_C6-1159" class="fnanchor">C6-1159</a> Although there is substantial evidence that
Litchfield did see Ruby at the Carousel Club about that time,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1160" href="#Footnote_C6-1160" class="fnanchor">C6-1160</a> there
is strong reason to believe that Litchfield did not see Lee Harvey
Oswald. Litchfield described the man he saw as having pockmarks
on the right side of his chin;<a id="FNanchor_C6-1161" href="#Footnote_C6-1161" class="fnanchor">C6-1161</a> Oswald did not have such identifying
marks.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1162" href="#Footnote_C6-1162" class="fnanchor">C6-1162</a> Moreover, the Commission has substantial doubts concerning
Litchfield’s credibility. Although present at an FBI interview of
another witness on November 29, Litchfield made no mention of his
observation to public officials until December 2, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1163" href="#Footnote_C6-1163" class="fnanchor">C6-1163</a> Litchfield,
who had twice been convicted for offenses involving forged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
checks,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1164" href="#Footnote_C6-1164" class="fnanchor">C6-1164</a> testified that he first recalled that Oswald resembled the
visitor he saw at the Carousel Club while watching a television
showing on Sunday morning, November 24, of the shooting by
Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1165" href="#Footnote_C6-1165" class="fnanchor">C6-1165</a> At that time Litchfield was playing poker with three
friends, and he testified that he promptly informed them of the resemblance
he observed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1166" href="#Footnote_C6-1166" class="fnanchor">C6-1166</a> However, none of the three poker companions
remembered Litchfield’s making such a remark; and two
added that Litchfield’s statements were often untrustworthy.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1167" href="#Footnote_C6-1167" class="fnanchor">C6-1167</a></p>

<p>With regard to all of the persons who claimed to have seen Ruby and
Oswald together, it is significant that none had particular reason to
pay close attention to either man, that substantial periods of time
elapsed before the events they assertedly witnessed became meaningful,
and that, unlike the eyewitnesses who claimed to have seen Oswald
on November 22, none reported their observations soon after Oswald
was arrested. In the course of its investigation, the Commission has
encountered numerous clear mistakes of identification. For example,
at least four persons, other than Crafard, are known to have been
mistaken for Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1168" href="#Footnote_C6-1168" class="fnanchor">C6-1168</a> Other persons have been misidentified as
Jack Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1169" href="#Footnote_C6-1169" class="fnanchor">C6-1169</a> Under all the available evidence there is no substantial
likelihood that the person the various witnesses claimed to have seen
with Ruby was in fact Oswald.</p>

<p>In addition to probing the reported evidence that Ruby and Oswald
had been seen together, the Commission has examined other circumstances
for signs that the two men were acquainted. From the time
Oswald returned from Mexico, both he and Jack Ruby lived in the
Oak Cliff section of Dallas, slightly more than a mile apart. Numerous
neighbors of both Oswald and Ruby were interviewed, and none
knew of any association between the two.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1170" href="#Footnote_C6-1170" class="fnanchor">C6-1170</a> Oswald’s work began
at 8 each weekday morning and terminated at 4:45 each afternoon.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1171" href="#Footnote_C6-1171" class="fnanchor">C6-1171</a>
Jack Ruby usually remained in his apartment until past 9 a.m. each
day.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1172" href="#Footnote_C6-1172" class="fnanchor">C6-1172</a> Although both men worked in downtown Dallas, they normally
traveled to their places of employment by different routes.
Ruby owned an automobile, and the shortest route downtown from his
home was via a freeway adjacent to his apartment.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1173" href="#Footnote_C6-1173" class="fnanchor">C6-1173</a> Oswald did not
own a car and had, at best, a rudimentary ability to drive.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1174" href="#Footnote_C6-1174" class="fnanchor">C6-1174</a> From
his roominghouses on North Beckley Avenue and on Marsalis Street, he
normally took public transportation which did not bring him within
six blocks of either Ruby’s apartment or his downtown nightclub, nor
did Oswald’s route from the bus stop to home or work bring him near
Ruby’s home or business.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1175" href="#Footnote_C6-1175" class="fnanchor">C6-1175</a> Persons at Oswald’s roominghouse testified
that he regularly came home promptly after work and remained in
his room.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1176" href="#Footnote_C6-1176" class="fnanchor">C6-1176</a> While in Dallas, he is not known to have visited any
nightclub.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1177" href="#Footnote_C6-1177" class="fnanchor">C6-1177</a> Ruby was generally at the Carousel Club from 9
o’clock each evening until after 1 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1178" href="#Footnote_C6-1178" class="fnanchor">C6-1178</a> In a few instances, Ruby
and Oswald patronized the same stores, but no indication has been
found that they ever met at such stores.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1179" href="#Footnote_C6-1179" class="fnanchor">C6-1179</a> Ruby at one time frequented
a restaurant where Oswald occasionally ate breakfast, but
the times of their patronage were widely separated and restaurant
employees knew of no acquaintance between Ruby and Oswald.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-1180" href="#Footnote_C6-1180" class="fnanchor">C6-1180</a>
Likewise, Ruby has held various memberships in the Dallas YMCA
and Oswald lived there for brief periods; however, there is no indication
that they were there at the same time.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1181" href="#Footnote_C6-1181" class="fnanchor">C6-1181</a></p>

<p>Both Ruby and Oswald maintained post office boxes at the terminal
annex of the U.S. post office in Dallas, but there is no indication that
those facts were more than coincidental. On November 1, 1963, Oswald
rented box No. 6225, his third since October 1962.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1182" href="#Footnote_C6-1182" class="fnanchor">C6-1182</a> Oswald’s
possible purpose has been discussed previously in this chapter. On
November 7, 1963, Jack Ruby rented post office box No. 5475 because
he hoped to receive mail responses to advertisements for the twistboard
exercise device which he was then promoting.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1183" href="#Footnote_C6-1183" class="fnanchor">C6-1183</a> Although it is conceivable
that Oswald and Ruby coincidentally encountered one another
while checking their boxes, the different daily schedules of the
two men render even this possibility unlikely. Moreover, Oswald’s
withdrawn personality makes it improbable that the two would have
spoken if their paths had crossed.</p>

<p>The Commission has also examined the known friends and acquaintances
of Ruby and Oswald for evidence that the two were acquainted,
but it has found very few possible links. One conceivable association
was through John Carter, a boarder at 1026 North Beckley Avenue
while Oswald lived there. Carter was friendly with Wanda Joyce
Killam, who had known Jack Ruby since shortly after he moved to
Dallas in 1947 and worked for him from July 1963 to early November
1963. Mrs. Killam, who volunteered the information about Carter’s
residence during an interview with an agent of the FBI, has
stated that she did not believe Carter ever visited the Carousel Club
and that she did not think Carter knew Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1184" href="#Footnote_C6-1184" class="fnanchor">C6-1184</a> Carter stated that
he had not heard of Ruby until Oswald was shot, had talked briefly
with Oswald only once or twice, and had never heard Oswald mention
Ruby or the Carousel Club.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1185" href="#Footnote_C6-1185" class="fnanchor">C6-1185</a> The Commission has no reason to disbelieve
either Mrs. Killam or Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>A second possible link between Oswald and Ruby was through Earlene
Roberts, the housekeeper at 1026 North Beckley Avenue. Bertha
Cheek, the sister of Mrs. Roberts, is known to have visited Jack Ruby
at the Carousel Club during the afternoon of November 18, 1963.
Mrs. Cheek testified that she had met with Ruby and a person whom
Ruby represented to be an interior decorator for the purpose of discussing
the possibility of financially backing Ruby in a new nightclub
which he planned to open. Mrs. Cheek said she had met Ruby
only once, a few years before, and that she had not heard of Oswald
until he shot President Kennedy.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1186" href="#Footnote_C6-1186" class="fnanchor">C6-1186</a> Mr. Frank Boerder, the decorator
who was present at the November 18 meeting, confirmed the substance
of the discussion reported by Mrs. Cheek,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1187" href="#Footnote_C6-1187" class="fnanchor">C6-1187</a> and other witnesses
establish that Ruby was, in fact, seeking an associate for a new nightclub
venture.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1188" href="#Footnote_C6-1188" class="fnanchor">C6-1188</a> There is no evidence that Jack Ruby ever associated
with Earlene Roberts, nor is there any indication that Mrs. Cheek
knew of Lee Harvey Oswald prior to November 22.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1189" href="#Footnote_C6-1189" class="fnanchor">C6-1189</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s trips to the home of Mrs. Ruth Paine at 2115 West Fifth
Street in Irving, Tex., presented another possible link to Ruby.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
While Oswald’s family resided with Mrs. Paine, William F. Simmons,
pianoplayer in the musical combo which worked at the Carousel Club
from September 17, 1963, until November 21, 1963, lived at 2539 West
Fifth Street, in Irving. Simmons has stated that his only relationship
to Ruby was as an employee, that Ruby never visited him, that
he did not know Oswald, and that he had never seen Oswald at the
Carousel Club.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1190" href="#Footnote_C6-1190" class="fnanchor">C6-1190</a> Other persons in the neighborhood knew of no
connection between Ruby and Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1191" href="#Footnote_C6-1191" class="fnanchor">C6-1191</a></p>

<p>The Commission has investigated rumors that Jack Ruby and Lee
Harvey Oswald were both homosexuals and, thus, might have known
each other in that respect. However, no evidence has been uncovered
to support the rumors, the closest acquaintances of both men emphatically
deny them,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1192" href="#Footnote_C6-1192" class="fnanchor">C6-1192</a> and Ruby’s nightclubs were not known to
have been frequented by homosexuals.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1193" href="#Footnote_C6-1193" class="fnanchor">C6-1193</a></p>

<p>A final suggestion of a connection between Jack Ruby and Lee
Harvey Oswald arises from the testimony of Oswald’s mother, Marguerite
Oswald. When appearing before the Commission, Mrs.
Oswald related that on November 23, 1963, before Ruby shot Oswald,
FBI Agent Bardwell D. Odum showed her a picture of a man she
believed was Jack Ruby, and asked whether the man shown was
familiar to her. Odum had first attempted to see Marina Oswald, but
Marguerite refused to allow Marina to be disturbed at that time.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1194" href="#Footnote_C6-1194" class="fnanchor">C6-1194</a>
In the course of Marguerite’s testimony, the Commission asked the
FBI for a copy of the photograph displayed by Odum to her. When
Marguerite viewed the photograph provided the Commission, she
stated that the picture was different from the one she saw in November,
in part because the “top two corners” were cut differently and because
the man depicted was not Jack Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1195" href="#Footnote_C6-1195" class="fnanchor">C6-1195</a></p>

<p>The Commission has investigated this matter and determined that
Special Agent Odum did show a picture to Marguerite Oswald for
possible identification but that the picture was not of Jack Ruby.
On November 22 the CIA had provided the FBI with a photograph
of a man who, it was thought at the time, might have been associated
with Oswald. To prevent the viewer from determining precisely
where the picture had been taken, FBI Agent Odum had trimmed the
background from the photograph by making a series of straight cuts
which reduced the picture to an irregular hexagonal shape.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1196" href="#Footnote_C6-1196" class="fnanchor">C6-1196</a> The
picture which was displayed by the Commission to Marguerite Oswald
was a copy of the same picture shown her by Agent Odum; however,
in supplying a duplicate photograph for Commission use the FBI
had cropped the background by cutting along the contours of the
body of the man shown,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1197" href="#Footnote_C6-1197" class="fnanchor">C6-1197</a> resulting in a photograph without any
background, unlike the first photograph Marguerite viewed on November
23. Affidavits obtained from the CIA and from the two FBI
agents who trimmed the photographs established that the one shown to
Mrs. Oswald before the Commission, though trimmed differently from
the one shown her on November 23, was a copy of the same picture.
Neither picture was of Jack Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1198" href="#Footnote_C6-1198" class="fnanchor">C6-1198</a> The original photograph had
been taken by the CIA outside of the United States sometime between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
July 1, 1963, and November 22, 1963, during all of which time Ruby
was within the country.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1199" href="#Footnote_C6-1199" class="fnanchor">C6-1199</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr137">Ruby’s Background and Associations</h4>

<p>In addition to examining in detail Jack Ruby’s activities from
November 21 to November 24 and his possible acquaintanceship with
Lee Harvey Oswald, the Commission has considered whether or not
Ruby had ties with individuals or groups that might have obviated
the need for any direct contact near the time of the assassination.
Study of Jack Ruby’s background, which is set out more fully in
appendix XVI, leads to the firm conclusion that he had no such ties.</p>

<p><i>Business activities.</i>—Ruby’s entire life is characteristic of a rigorously
independent person. He moved from his family home soon
after leaving high school at age 16, although a “family” residence has
been maintained in Chicago throughout the years.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1200" href="#Footnote_C6-1200" class="fnanchor">C6-1200</a> Later, in 1947,
he moved from Chicago to Dallas and maintained only sporadic contact
with most of his family.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1201" href="#Footnote_C6-1201" class="fnanchor">C6-1201</a> For most of his working years and
continuously since 1947, Jack Ruby was self-employed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1202" href="#Footnote_C6-1202" class="fnanchor">C6-1202</a> Although
he had partners from time to time, the partnerships were not lasting,
and Ruby seems to have preferred to operate independently.</p>

<p>Ruby’s main sources of income were his two nightclubs—the Carousel
Club and the Vegas Club—although he also frequently pursued
a number of independent, short-lived business promotions.
(Ruby’s business dealings are described in greater detail in <a href="#APPENDIX_XVI">app.
XVI</a>.) At the time of the assassination, the United States claimed
approximately $44,000 in delinquent taxes, and he was in substantial
debt to his brother Earl and to his friend Ralph Paul.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1203" href="#Footnote_C6-1203" class="fnanchor">C6-1203</a> However,
there are no indications that Earl Ruby or Ralph Paul was exerting
pressure for payment or that Ruby’s tax liabilities were not susceptible
to an acceptable settlement. Ruby operated his clubs on a cash basis,
usually carrying large amounts of cash on his person; thus there is
no particular significance to the fact that approximately $3,000 in
cash was found on his person and in his automobile when arrested.
Nor do his meager financial records reflect any suspicious activities.
He used his bank accounts only infrequently, with no unexplained
large transactions; and no entries were made to Ruby’s safe-deposit
boxes in over a year prior to the shooting of Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1204" href="#Footnote_C6-1204" class="fnanchor">C6-1204</a> There is
no evidence that Ruby received any sums after his arrest except royalties
from a syndicated newspaper article on his life and small contributions
for his defense from friends, sympathizers, and family
members.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1205" href="#Footnote_C6-1205" class="fnanchor">C6-1205</a></p>

<p><i>Ruby’s political activities.</i>—Jack Ruby considered himself a Democrat,
perhaps in part because his brother Hyman had been active
in Democratic ward politics in Chicago.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1206" href="#Footnote_C6-1206" class="fnanchor">C6-1206</a> When Ruby was arrested,
police officers found in his apartment, 10 political cards urging the
election of the “Conservative Democratic slate,”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1207" href="#Footnote_C6-1207" class="fnanchor">C6-1207</a> but the Commission
has found no evidence that Ruby had distributed that literature
and he is not known ever to have campaigned for any political candidates.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-1208" href="#Footnote_C6-1208" class="fnanchor">C6-1208</a>
None of his friends or associates expressed any knowledge
that he belonged to any groups interested in political issues, nor did
they remember that he had discussed political problems except on rare
occasions.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1209" href="#Footnote_C6-1209" class="fnanchor">C6-1209</a></p>

<p>As a young man, Ruby participated in attacks upon meetings of the
German-American Bund in Chicago, but the assaults were the efforts
of poolhall associates from his predominantly Jewish neighborhood
rather than the work of any political group. His only other known
activities which had any political flavor possessed stronger overtones
of financial self-interest. In early 1942 he registered a copyright for
a placard which displayed an American flag and bore the inscription
“Remember Pearl Harbor.” The placard was never successfully promoted.
At other times, he is reported to have attempted to sell busts
of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1210" href="#Footnote_C6-1210" class="fnanchor">C6-1210</a> The rabbi of Ruby’s synagogue
expressed the belief that Ruby was too unsophisticated to
grasp or have a significant interest in any political creed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1211" href="#Footnote_C6-1211" class="fnanchor">C6-1211</a> Although
various views have been given concerning Ruby’s attitude
toward President Kennedy prior to the assassination, the overwhelming
number of witnesses reported that Ruby had considerable
respect for the President, and there has been no report of any
hostility toward him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1212" href="#Footnote_C6-1212" class="fnanchor">C6-1212</a></p>

<p>There is also no reliable indication that Ruby was ever associated
with any Communist or radical causes. Jack Ruby’s parents were
born in Poland in the 1870’s and his father served in the Czarist
Russian army from 1893-98. Though neither parent became a citizen
after emigrating to the United States in the early 1900’s, the evidence
indicates that neither Ruby nor his family maintained any
ties with relatives in Europe.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1213" href="#Footnote_C6-1213" class="fnanchor">C6-1213</a> Jack Ruby has denied ever being
connected with any Communist activities. The FBI has reported
that, prior to the shooting of Oswald, its nationwide files contained
no information of any subversive activities by Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1214" href="#Footnote_C6-1214" class="fnanchor">C6-1214</a> In addition,
a Commission staff member has personally examined all subversive
activities reports from the Dallas-Fort Worth office of the
FBI for the year 1963 and has found no reports pertaining to Jack
Ruby or any of his known acquaintances.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1215" href="#Footnote_C6-1215" class="fnanchor">C6-1215</a></p>

<p>The Commission has directed considerable attention to an allegation
that Jack Ruby was connected with Communist Party activities
in Muncie, Ind. On the day after Oswald’s death, a former resident
of Muncie claimed that between 1943 and 1947 a Chicagoan resembling
Ruby and known to him as Jack Rubenstein was in Muncie on three occasions
and associated with persons who the witness suspected were
Communists. The witness stated that the man resembling Ruby visited
Muncie during these years as a guest of the son-in-law of a now-deceased
jeweler for whom the witness worked.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1216" href="#Footnote_C6-1216" class="fnanchor">C6-1216</a> A second son-in-law
of the jewelry store owner suggested that he may have known
Ruby while the two resided in Chicago,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1217" href="#Footnote_C6-1217" class="fnanchor">C6-1217</a> but the son-in-law whom
Ruby allegedly visited disclaimed any acquaintanceship with
Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1218" href="#Footnote_C6-1218" class="fnanchor">C6-1218</a> Both sons-in-law denied any Communist activities and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
the Commission has found no contrary evidence other than the
testimony of the witness.</p>

<p>On the first two occasions on which Ruby is alleged to have been
in Muncie, military records show him to have been on active military
duty in the South.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1219" href="#Footnote_C6-1219" class="fnanchor">C6-1219</a> The witness also said that the man he knew
as Rubenstein owned or managed a nightclub when he met him, but
the Commission has no reliable evidence that Jack Ruby ever owned
or worked in any nightclubs when he lived in Chicago.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1220" href="#Footnote_C6-1220" class="fnanchor">C6-1220</a> The witness
further stated that on one occasion he found the name of Jack
Rubenstein, or perhaps a similar name, together with the names of
others he believed were Communists, on a list which had been left
in a room above the jewelry store after a meeting held there. The
witness said he gave the list to his wife’s cousin, now deceased, who
was then the chief of detectives in Muncie.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1221" href="#Footnote_C6-1221" class="fnanchor">C6-1221</a> However, neither
the list nor a person identifiable as Jack Ruby has been located after
a thorough search by the FBI of its own files and those of the Muncie
Police Department, the Indiana State Police, and other agencies.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1222" href="#Footnote_C6-1222" class="fnanchor">C6-1222</a>
The witness did not recall seeing Rubenstein in Muncie during the
period of that meeting, and he had never heard Rubenstein say anything
which would indicate he was a Communist.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1223" href="#Footnote_C6-1223" class="fnanchor">C6-1223</a></p>

<p>The FBI has interviewed all living persons who the witness stated
were involved with Ruby in Communist activities in Muncie. One
person named by the witness was known previously to have been
involved in Communist Party activities, but subversive activities files
have revealed no such activities for any of the others.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1224" href="#Footnote_C6-1224" class="fnanchor">C6-1224</a> The admitted
former Communist denied knowing Ruby and stated that the
jewelry store owner was not known to him as a Communist and that
Communist meetings were never held above the store.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1225" href="#Footnote_C6-1225" class="fnanchor">C6-1225</a> All other
Muncie residents named by the witness as possible associates of Ruby
denied knowing Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1226" href="#Footnote_C6-1226" class="fnanchor">C6-1226</a> Similarly, fellow employees of the witness
whom he did not claim were Communists knew of no Communist
activities connected with the jewelry store owner or any visits of Jack
Ruby, and FBI informants familiar with Communist activities in
Indiana and Chicago did not know of any participation by Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1227" href="#Footnote_C6-1227" class="fnanchor">C6-1227</a>
Finally, the witness testified that even though he believed as early as
1947 that all of the persons named by him were Communists he had
never brought his information to the attention of any authority investigating
such activities, except for providing the alleged list to his
cousin.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1228" href="#Footnote_C6-1228" class="fnanchor">C6-1228</a> The Commission finds no basis for accepting the witness’s
testimony.</p>

<p>The Commission has also investigated the possibility that Ruby was
associated with ultraconservative political endeavors in Dallas. Upon
his arrest, there were found in Ruby’s possession two radio scripts of
a right-wing program promoted by H. L. Hunt, whose political views
are highly conservative. Ruby had acquired the scripts a few weeks
earlier at the Texas Products Show, where they were enclosed in bags
of Hunt food products. Ruby is reported to have become enraged
when he discovered the scripts, and threatened to send one to “Kennedy.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1229" href="#Footnote_C6-1229" class="fnanchor">C6-1229</a>
He is not known to have done anything with them prior to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
giving one to a radio announcer on Nevember 23; and on that day he
seemed to confuse organizations of the extreme right with those of the
far left.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1230" href="#Footnote_C6-1230" class="fnanchor">C6-1230</a> On November 21, Ruby drove Connie Trammel, a young
college graduate whom he had met some months previously, to the
office of Lamar Hunt, the son of H. L. Hunt, for a job interview. Although
Ruby stated that he would like to meet Hunt, seemingly to establish
a business connection, he did not enter Hunt’s office with her.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1231" href="#Footnote_C6-1231" class="fnanchor">C6-1231</a></p>

<p>An allegation that Ruby was a visitor at the home of Maj. Gen.
Edwin A. Walker (Resigned, U.S. Army) appears totally unfounded.
The allegation was made in late May 1964 to an agent of the U.S.
Secret Service by William McEwan Duff. Duff, who was discharged
from military service in June 1964 because of a fraudulent enlistment,
disclaimed any knowledge of Ruby or Oswald when questioned by
FBI agents in January 1964.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1232" href="#Footnote_C6-1232" class="fnanchor">C6-1232</a></p>

<p>Another allegation connecting Jack Ruby with right-wing activities
was Mark Lane’s assertion, mentioned previously, that an unnamed
informant told him of a meeting lasting more than 2 hours in
the Carousel Club on November 14, 1963, between Jack Ruby, Patrolman
J. D. Tippit, and Bernard Weissman.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1233" href="#Footnote_C6-1233" class="fnanchor">C6-1233</a> Although the name of
Lane’s informant has never been revealed to the Commission, an investigation
has been conducted in an effort to find corroboration for the
claimed Tippit, Weissman, and Ruby meeting. No employee of the
Carousel Club has any knowledge of the meeting described by Lane.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1234" href="#Footnote_C6-1234" class="fnanchor">C6-1234</a>
Ruby and Weissman both deny that such a meeting occurred, and
Officer Tippit’s widow has no knowledge that her late husband ever
went to the Carousel Club.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1235" href="#Footnote_C6-1235" class="fnanchor">C6-1235</a></p>

<p>Some confusion has arisen, however, because early Friday afternoon,
November 22, Ruby remarked that he knew the Tippit who
had been shot by Oswald. Later Ruby stated that he did not
know J. D. Tippit but that his reference was to G. M. Tippit, a member
of the special services bureau of the Dallas Police Department who
had visited Ruby establishments occasionally in the course of his official
duties.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1236" href="#Footnote_C6-1236" class="fnanchor">C6-1236</a> Larry Crafard was unable to recognize photographs of
J. D. Tippit and had no recollection of a Tippit, Weissman, and Ruby
meeting at any time.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1237" href="#Footnote_C6-1237" class="fnanchor">C6-1237</a> However, uncertainty was introduced when
Crafard identified a photograph of Bernard Weissman as resembling a
man who had visited the Carousel Club and had been referred to by
Ruby as “Weissman.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1238" href="#Footnote_C6-1238" class="fnanchor">C6-1238</a> In a subsequent interview Crafard stated
that he believed Weissman was a detective on the Dallas Police Department,
that his first name may have been Johnny, and that he was in
his late thirties or early forties.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1239" href="#Footnote_C6-1239" class="fnanchor">C6-1239</a> As set forth previously, Bernard
Weissman was a 26-year-old New York carpet salesman. Crafard
added “I could have my recollection of a Mr. Weissman mixed up
with someone else”.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1240" href="#Footnote_C6-1240" class="fnanchor">C6-1240</a></p>

<p>Ruby’s conduct on November 22 and 23, 1963, corroborates his denial
that he knew Bernard Weissman. Ruby expressed hostility to the
November 22 full-page advertisement to many persons. To none
did he give any indication that he was familiar with the person listed
as responsible for the advertisement.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1241" href="#Footnote_C6-1241" class="fnanchor">C6-1241</a> His attempt on November 23<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
to trace the holder of the post office box shown on the “Impeach Earl
Warren” sign and to locate Weissman’s name in a Dallas city directory<a id="FNanchor_C6-1242" href="#Footnote_C6-1242" class="fnanchor">C6-1242</a>
also tends to indicate that in fact he was not familiar with
Weissman. Had he been involved in some type of unlawful activity
with Weissman, it is highly unlikely that Ruby would have called
attention to Weissman as he did.</p>

<p>Investigation has disclosed no evidence that Officer J. D. Tippit was
acquainted with either Ruby or Oswald. Neither Tippit’s wife nor his
close friends knew of such an acquaintanceship.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1243" href="#Footnote_C6-1243" class="fnanchor">C6-1243</a> Tippit was not
known to frequent nightclubs<a id="FNanchor_C6-1244" href="#Footnote_C6-1244" class="fnanchor">C6-1244</a> and he had no reason during the
course of his police duties to enter Ruby’s clubs.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1245" href="#Footnote_C6-1245" class="fnanchor">C6-1245</a> Although at the
time of the assassination Tippit was working weekends in a Dallas
restaurant owned by a member of the John Birch Society, the
restaurant owner stated that he never discussed politics with Tippit.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1246" href="#Footnote_C6-1246" class="fnanchor">C6-1246</a>
Persons close to Tippit related that Tippit rarely discussed political
matters with any person and that he was a member of no political
organization.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1247" href="#Footnote_C6-1247" class="fnanchor">C6-1247</a> Telephone records for the period following September
26, 1963, revealed no suspicious long-distance calls from the Tippit
household.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1248" href="#Footnote_C6-1248" class="fnanchor">C6-1248</a></p>

<p>Tippit’s encounter with Oswald following the shooting of the President
is indicative of no prior association between the two men. Police
radio logs show that, as part of general directions issued to all officers
immediately after the assassination, Tippit was specifically directed
to patrol the Oak Cliff area where he came upon Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1249" href="#Footnote_C6-1249" class="fnanchor">C6-1249</a> His
movement from the area which he had been patrolling into the central
Oak Cliff area was also in conformity with the normal procedure
of the Dallas Police Department for patrol cars to cover nearby
districts when the patrol cars in that district became otherwise engaged,
as occurred after the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1250" href="#Footnote_C6-1250" class="fnanchor">C6-1250</a> Oswald fit the general
description, which, 15 minutes after the assassination, was broadcast to
all police cars of a suspect described by a bystander who had seen
Oswald in the sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1251" href="#Footnote_C6-1251" class="fnanchor">C6-1251</a>
There is thus no basis for any inference that, in approaching
Oswald, Tippit was acting other than in the line of police duty.</p>

<p><i>Allegations of Cuban activity.</i>—No substantiation has been found
for rumors linking Ruby with pro- or anti-Castro Cuban activities,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1252" href="#Footnote_C6-1252" class="fnanchor">C6-1252</a>
except for one incident in January 1959 when Ruby made preliminary
inquiries, as a middleman, concerning the possible sale to Cuba of
some surplus jeeps located in Shreveport, La., and asked about the
possible release of prisoners from a Cuban prison. No evidence has
been developed that the project ever became more than a “possibility”.
Ruby explained that in early 1959 United States sentiment toward
Cuba was still favorable and that he was merely pursuing a money-making
opportunity.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1253" href="#Footnote_C6-1253" class="fnanchor">C6-1253</a></p>

<p>During the period of the “jeep sale”, R. D. Matthews, a gambler
and a “passing acquaintance” of Ruby, returned to Dallas from Havana
where he had been living. In mid-1959, he returned to Cuba
until mid-1960.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1254" href="#Footnote_C6-1254" class="fnanchor">C6-1254</a> On October 3, 1963, a telephone call was made from
the Carousel Club to Matthews’ former wife in Shreveport.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1255" href="#Footnote_C6-1255" class="fnanchor">C6-1255</a> No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
evidence has been uncovered that Matthews was associated with the
sale of jeeps or the release of prisoners or that he knew of Oswald
prior to the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1256" href="#Footnote_C6-1256" class="fnanchor">C6-1256</a> Matthews’ ex-wife did not recall the
phone call in October of 1963, and she asserted that she did not know
Jack Ruby or anybody working for him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1257" href="#Footnote_C6-1257" class="fnanchor">C6-1257</a></p>

<p>In September 1959, Ruby traveled to Havana as a guest of a close
friend and known gambler, Lewis J. McWillie. Both Ruby and
McWillie state the trip was purely social.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1258" href="#Footnote_C6-1258" class="fnanchor">C6-1258</a> In January 1961,
McWillie left Cuba with strong feelings of hostility to the Castro
regime. In early 1963, Ruby purchased a pistol which he shipped to
McWillie in Nevada, but McWillie did not accept the package.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1259" href="#Footnote_C6-1259" class="fnanchor">C6-1259</a>
The Commission has found no evidence that McWillie has engaged in
any activities since leaving Cuba that are related to pro- or anti-Castro
political movements or that he was involved in Ruby’s abortive jeep
transaction.</p>

<p>The Commission has also received evidence that in April 1962, a
telegram sent to Havana, Cuba, was charged to the business telephone
of Earl Ruby, brother of Jack Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1260" href="#Footnote_C6-1260" class="fnanchor">C6-1260</a> Earl Ruby stated that he
was unable to recall that telegram but testified that he had never traveled
to Cuba nor had any dealings with persons in Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1261" href="#Footnote_C6-1261" class="fnanchor">C6-1261</a> Jack
Ruby is not known to have visited his brother at that time, and during
that period Earl and Jack did not maintain a close relationship.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1262" href="#Footnote_C6-1262" class="fnanchor">C6-1262</a>
Earl Ruby is not known to have been involved in any subversive
activities.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1263" href="#Footnote_C6-1263" class="fnanchor">C6-1263</a></p>

<p>Finally, examination of FBI information relative to Cuban groups
in the Dallas-Fort Worth area for the year 1963 fails to disclose any
person who might provide a link between Ruby and such groups.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1264" href="#Footnote_C6-1264" class="fnanchor">C6-1264</a>
The Central Intelligence Agency has no information suggesting that
Jack Ruby or any of his closest associates have been involved in any
type of revolutionary or subversive Cuban activity.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1265" href="#Footnote_C6-1265" class="fnanchor">C6-1265</a></p>

<p><i>Possible underworld connections.</i>—The Commission has investigated
Ruby’s possible criminal activities, looking with particular
concern for evidence that he engaged in illegal activities with members
of the organized underworld or that, on his own, he was a promoter
of illegal endeavors. The results of that investigation are more
fully detailed in appendix XVI. Ruby was reared in a Chicago
neighborhood where he became acquainted with local criminals and
with persons who later became criminals. Throughout his life, Ruby’s
friendships with persons of that character were limited largely to
professional gamblers, although his night club businesses brought him
in contact with persons who had been convicted of other offenses.
There is no credible evidence that Ruby, himself, gambled on other
than a social basis or that he had any unpaid gambling debts.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1266" href="#Footnote_C6-1266" class="fnanchor">C6-1266</a> He
had never been charged with a felony prior to his attack on Oswald;
his only encounters in Chicago stemmed from ticket scalping and the
unauthorized sale of copyrighted music; and, in Dallas, his law violations,
excluding traffic charges, resulted from the operation of his
clubs or outbursts of temper.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1267" href="#Footnote_C6-1267" class="fnanchor">C6-1267</a> Ruby has disclaimed that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
associated with organized criminal activities, and law enforcement
agencies have confirmed that denial.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1268" href="#Footnote_C6-1268" class="fnanchor">C6-1268</a></p>

<p><i>Investigation of George Senator.</i>—In addition to examining Ruby’s
own activities and background, the Commission has paid careful attention
to the activities and background of George Senator, Ruby’s
roommate and one of his closest friends in Dallas. Senator was interrogated
by staff members over a 2-day period; he provided a detailed
account of his own life and cooperated fully in all aspects of the
Commission’s inquiry into the activities of Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Senator was 50 years old at the time Ruby shot Oswald. He had
been born September 4, 1913, in Gloversville, N.Y., and had received
an eighth grade education. Upon leaving school, he worked in Gloversville
and New York City until about age 25. For the next few
years he worked in various restaurants and cafeterias in New York
and Florida until enlisting in the Army in August 1941.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1269" href="#Footnote_C6-1269" class="fnanchor">C6-1269</a> After his
honorable discharge in September 1945, Senator was employed for
most of the next 13 years selling inexpensive dresses throughout the
South and Southwest. In the course of that employment he moved
to Dallas where he met Jack Ruby while visiting Ruby’s Vegas Club
in about 1955 or 1956.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1270" href="#Footnote_C6-1270" class="fnanchor">C6-1270</a> Ruby was one of many who helped Senator
when he encountered financial difficulties during the years 1958 to
1962. For a while in 1962, Ruby provided room and board in exchange
for Senator’s help in his clubs and apartment. In August
1963, Senator was unable to maintain his own apartment alone following
his roommate’s marriage. Ruby again offered to help and on
November 1, 1963, Senator moved into Ruby’s apartment.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1271" href="#Footnote_C6-1271" class="fnanchor">C6-1271</a> The
Commission has found no evidence that Senator ever engaged in any
political activities.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1272" href="#Footnote_C6-1272" class="fnanchor">C6-1272</a></p>

<p>Against this background the Commission has evaluated Senator’s
account of his own activities on November 22, 23, and 24. When
questioned by Dallas and Federal authorities hours after the shooting
of Oswald, Senator omitted mention of having accompanied Ruby
to photograph the “Impeach Earl Warren” sign on Saturday morning.
Senator stated to Commission staff members that in the interviews of
November 24 he omitted the incident because of oversight.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1273" href="#Footnote_C6-1273" class="fnanchor">C6-1273</a> However,
he spoke freely about it in his sworn testimony and no inaccuracies
have been noted in that portion of his testimony. Senator also
failed to mention to the Commission and to previous interrogators
that, shortly after Ruby left their apartment Sunday morning, he
called friends, Mr. and Mrs. William Downey, and offered to visit their
apartment and make breakfast for them.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1274" href="#Footnote_C6-1274" class="fnanchor">C6-1274</a> Downey stated, in June
1964, that Senator said he was alone and that, after Downey declined
the offer, Senator remarked that he would then go downtown for
breakfast.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1275" href="#Footnote_C6-1275" class="fnanchor">C6-1275</a> When told of Downey’s account, Senator denied it and
explained that the two were not friendly by the time Senator left
Dallas about six weeks after the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1276" href="#Footnote_C6-1276" class="fnanchor">C6-1276</a></p>

<p>The Commission also experienced difficulty in ascertaining the
activities of Senator on November 22 and 23. He was unable to account
specifically for large segments of time when he was not with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1277" href="#Footnote_C6-1277" class="fnanchor">C6-1277</a> And, as to places and people Senator says he visited on
those days prior to the time Oswald was shot, the Commission has
been unsuccessful in obtaining verification.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1278" href="#Footnote_C6-1278" class="fnanchor">C6-1278</a> Senator admitted that
he had spent much of that time drinking but denied that he was
intoxicated.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1279" href="#Footnote_C6-1279" class="fnanchor">C6-1279</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to know with complete certainty whether Senator
had any foreknowledge of the shooting of Oswald. Ruby testified that
at about 10:15 a.m. on Sunday morning, November 24, he said, in
Senator’s presence, “If something happened to this person, that then
Mrs. Kennedy won’t have to come back for the trial.”<a id="FNanchor_C6-1280" href="#Footnote_C6-1280" class="fnanchor">C6-1280</a> According to
Ruby, this is the most explicit statement he made concerning Oswald
that morning.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1281" href="#Footnote_C6-1281" class="fnanchor">C6-1281</a> Senator denies any knowledge of Ruby’s intentions.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1282" href="#Footnote_C6-1282" class="fnanchor">C6-1282</a></p>

<p>Senator’s general response to the shooting was not like that of a person
seeking to conceal his guilt. Shortly before it was known that
Ruby was the slayer of Oswald, Senator visited the Eatwell Restaurant
in downtown Dallas. Upon being informed that Ruby was the attacker,
Senator exclaimed, “My God,” in what appeared to be a genuinely
surprised tone.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1283" href="#Footnote_C6-1283" class="fnanchor">C6-1283</a> He then ran to a telephone, returned to gulp
down his coffee, and quickly departed.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1284" href="#Footnote_C6-1284" class="fnanchor">C6-1284</a> He drove promptly to the
home of James Martin, an attorney and friend. Martin recalled that
Senator’s concern was for his friend Ruby and not for himself.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1285" href="#Footnote_C6-1285" class="fnanchor">C6-1285</a>
Martin and Senator drove to the Dallas Police Department where Senator
voluntarily submitted himself to police questioning, and gave interviews
to newspaper and television reporters.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1286" href="#Footnote_C6-1286" class="fnanchor">C6-1286</a> The Commission
has concluded, on the basis of its investigation into Senator’s background,
activities, and reaction to the shooting, that Senator did not
aid or conspire with Jack Ruby in the killing of Oswald.</p>

<p><i>Ruby’s activities preceding President’s trip.</i>—In addition to the
broad investigation into Ruby’s background and associations, the
Commission delved particularly into Ruby’s pattern of activities during
the 2 months preceding President Kennedy’s visit to Dallas in
order to determine whether there was unusual conduct which might
be linked to the President’s forthcoming trip.</p>

<p>The Commission has been able to account specifically for Jack Ruby’s
presence in Dallas on every day after September 26, 1963, except
five—September 29, 30 and October 11, 14, and 24—and there is no evidence
that he was out of the Dallas-Fort Worth area on those days.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1287" href="#Footnote_C6-1287" class="fnanchor">C6-1287</a>
The report of one person who saw Ruby on September 28 indicates that
Ruby probably remained in Dallas on September 29 and 30,<a id="FNanchor_C6-1288" href="#Footnote_C6-1288" class="fnanchor">C6-1288</a> when
Oswald was in Mexico City. The Commission has looked for but has
found no evidence that Ruby traveled to Mexico at that time.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1289" href="#Footnote_C6-1289" class="fnanchor">C6-1289</a> Both
Ruby and Ralph Paul have stated that Ruby did not leave the Dallas-Fort
Worth area during September, October, or November 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1290" href="#Footnote_C6-1290" class="fnanchor">C6-1290</a></p>

<p>During October and November of 1963, Jack Ruby maintained his
usual vigorous pace of business activities. In particular, he directed
considerable attention to his two nightclubs and to other business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
promotions.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1291" href="#Footnote_C6-1291" class="fnanchor">C6-1291</a> During the final month before the Kennedy trip, his
time was increasingly occupied with personnel problems at both his
clubs. There is no indication that he devoted less than full attention
to these matters or that he appeared preoccupied with other affairs.
His acquaintances did feel that Ruby seemed depressed and
concerned that his friends were deserting him.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1292" href="#Footnote_C6-1292" class="fnanchor">C6-1292</a> However, there
were no signs of secretive conduct.</p>

<p>Scrutiny of Ruby’s activities during the several days preceding
the President’s arrival in Dallas has revealed no indication of any
unusual activity. Ruby is remembered to have discussed the President’s
impending trip with only two persons and only briefly.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1293" href="#Footnote_C6-1293" class="fnanchor">C6-1293</a>
Two newspapers containing a description of the expected motorcade
routes through Dallas and Fort Worth were found in Ruby’s car at
the time of this arrest. However, such papers circulated widely in
Dallas, and Ruby’s car, like his apartment, was so cluttered with other
newspapers, notebooks, brochures, cards, clothing, and personal
items<a id="FNanchor_C6-1294" href="#Footnote_C6-1294" class="fnanchor">C6-1294</a> that there is no reason to attach any significance to the papers.</p>

<p>Aside from the results of the Commission’s investigation reported
above, there are other reasons to doubt that Jack Ruby would have
shot Oswald as he did if he had been involved in a conspiracy to carry
out the assassination, or that he would have been delegated to perform
the shooting of Oswald on behalf of others who were involved in
the slaying of the President. By striking in the city jail, Ruby was
certain to be apprehended. An attempt to silence Oswald by having
Ruby kill him would have presented exceptionally grave dangers to
any other persons involved in the scheme. If the attempt had failed,
Oswald might have been moved to disclose his confederates to the
authorities. If it succeeded, as it did, the additional killing might
itself have produced a trail to them. Moreover, Ruby was regarded
by most persons who knew him as moody and unstable—hardly one to
have encouraged the confidence of persons involved in a sensitive conspiracy.<a id="FNanchor_C6-1295" href="#Footnote_C6-1295" class="fnanchor">C6-1295</a></p>

<p>Since his apprehension, Jack Ruby has provided the Federal authorities
with several detailed accounts of his activities both preceding
and following the assassination of President Kennedy. Ruby has
shown no reluctance to answer any questions addressed to him. The
accounts provided by Ruby are consistent with evidence available to
the Commission from other sources.</p>

<p>These additional considerations are thus fully consistent with the
results of the Commission’s investigation. Rumors of a connection
between Ruby and Oswald have proved groundless, while examination
of Ruby’s background and associations, his behavior prior to
the assassination, and his activities during the November 22-24 weekend
has yielded no evidence that Ruby conspired with anyone in
planning or executing the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald. Whatever
the legal culpability of Jack Ruby for his act of November 24, the
evidence is persuasive that he acted independently in shooting Oswald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span></p>

<h3 id="hdr138">CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>Based upon the investigation reviewed in this chapter, the Commission
concluded that there is no credible evidence that Lee Harvey
Oswald was part of a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy.
Examination of the facts of the assassination itself revealed no indication
that Oswald was aided in the planning or execution of his scheme.
Review of Oswald’s life and activities since 1959, although productive
in illuminating the character of Lee Harvey Oswald (which is discussed
in the next chapter), did not produce any meaningful evidence
of a conspiracy. The Commission discovered no evidence
that the Soviet Union or Cuba were involved in the assassination
of President Kennedy. Nor did the Commission’s investigation of
Jack Ruby produce any grounds for believing that Ruby’s killing
of Oswald was part of a conspiracy. The conclusion that there is no
evidence of a conspiracy was also reached independently by Dean
Rusk, the Secretary of State; Robert S. McNamara, the Secretary of
Defense; C. Douglas Dillon, the Secretary of the Treasury; Robert F.
Kennedy, the Attorney General; J. Edgar Hoover, the Director of the
FBI; John A. McCone, the Director of the CIA; and James J. Rowley,
the Chief of the Secret Service, on the basis of the information
available to each of them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span><a id="FNanchor_C6-1296" href="#Footnote_C6-1296" class="fnanchor">C6-1296</a></p>

<span class="subhead">Lee Harvey Oswald: Background and Possible Motives</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The evidence</span> reviewed above identifies Lee Harvey
Oswald as the assassin of President Kennedy and indicates
that he acted alone in that event. There is no evidence that
he had accomplices or that he was involved in any conspiracy directed
to the assassination of the President. There remains the question of
what impelled Oswald to conceive and to carry out the assassination
of the President of the United States. The Commission has considered
many possible motives for the assassination, including those which
might flow from Oswald’s commitment to Marxism or communism,
the existence of some personal grievance, a desire to effect changes in
the structure of society or simply to go down in history as a well
publicized assassin. None of these possibilities satisfactorily explains
Oswald’s act if it is judged by the standards of reasonable men. The
motives of any man, however, must be analyzed in terms of the
character and state of mind of the particular individual involved.
For a motive that appears incomprehensible to other men may be the
moving force of a man whose view of the world has been twisted,
possibly by factors of which those around him were only dimly aware.
Oswald’s complete state of mind and character are now outside of
the power of man to know. He cannot, of course, be questioned or observed
by those charged with the responsibility for this report or by
experts on their behalf. There is, however, a large amount of material
available in his writings and in the history of his life which does give
some insight into his character and, possibly, into the motives for his
act.</p>

<p>Since Oswald is dead, the Commission is not able to reach any
definite conclusions as to whether or not he was “sane” under prevailing
legal standards. Under our system of justice no forum could
properly make that determination unless Oswald were before it. It
certainly could not be made by this Commission which, as has been
pointed out above, ascertained the facts surrounding the assassination
but did not draw conclusions concerning Oswald’s legal guilt.</p>

<p>Indications of Oswald’s motivation may be obtained from a study
of the events, relationships and influences which appear to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
significant in shaping his character and in guiding him. Perhaps the
most outstanding conclusion of such a study is that Oswald was profoundly
alienated from the world in which he lived. His life was
characterized by isolation, frustration, and failure. He had very few,
if any, close relationships with other people and he appeared to have
great difficulty in finding a meaningful place in the world. He was
never satisfied with anything. When he was in the United States he
resented the capitalist system which he thought was exploiting him
and others like him. He seemed to prefer the Soviet Union and he
spoke highly of Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_C7-1" href="#Footnote_C7-1" class="fnanchor">C7-1</a> When he was in the Soviet Union, he apparently
resented the Communist Party members, who were accorded special
privileges and who he thought were betraying communism, and he
spoke well of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_C7-2" href="#Footnote_C7-2" class="fnanchor">C7-2</a> He accused his wife of preferring
others to himself and told her to return to the Soviet Union without
him but without a divorce. At the same time he professed his love for
her and said that he could not get along without her.<a id="FNanchor_C7-3" href="#Footnote_C7-3" class="fnanchor">C7-3</a> Marina Oswald
thought that he would not be happy anywhere, “Only on the moon,
perhaps.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-4" href="#Footnote_C7-4" class="fnanchor">C7-4</a></p>

<p>While Oswald appeared to most of those who knew him as a meek
and harmless person, he sometimes imagined himself as “the Commander”<a id="FNanchor_C7-5" href="#Footnote_C7-5" class="fnanchor">C7-5</a>
and, apparently seriously, as a political prophet—a man who
said that after 20 years he would be prime minister.<a id="FNanchor_C7-6" href="#Footnote_C7-6" class="fnanchor">C7-6</a> His wife testified
that he compared himself with great leaders of history. Such ideas of
grandeur were apparently accompanied by notions of oppression.<a id="FNanchor_C7-7" href="#Footnote_C7-7" class="fnanchor">C7-7</a>
He had a great hostility toward his environment, whatever it happened
to be, which he expressed in striking and sometimes violent acts long
before the assassination. There was some quality about him that led
him to act with an apparent disregard for possible consequences.<a id="FNanchor_C7-8" href="#Footnote_C7-8" class="fnanchor">C7-8</a> He
defected to the Soviet Union, shot at General Walker, tried to go to
Cuba and even contemplated hijacking an airplane to get there. He
assassinated the President, shot Officer Tippit, resisted arrest and
tried to kill another policeman in the process.</p>

<p>Oswald apparently started reading about communism when he was
about 15. In the Marines, he evidenced a strong conviction as to the
correctness of Marxist doctrine, which one associate described as “irrevocable,”
but also as “theoretical”; that associate did not think that
Oswald was a Communist.<a id="FNanchor_C7-9" href="#Footnote_C7-9" class="fnanchor">C7-9</a> Oswald did not always distinguish
between Marxism and communism.<a id="FNanchor_C7-10" href="#Footnote_C7-10" class="fnanchor">C7-10</a> He stated several times that he
was a Communist but apparently never joined any Communist Party.<a id="FNanchor_C7-11" href="#Footnote_C7-11" class="fnanchor">C7-11</a></p>

<p>His attachment to Marxist and Communist doctrine was probably,
in some measure, an expression of his hostility to his environment.
While there is doubt about how fully Oswald understood the doctrine
which he so often espoused, it seems clear that his commitment to
Marxism was an important factor influencing his conduct during his
adult years. It was an obvious element in his decision to go to Russia
and later to Cuba and it probably influenced his decision to shoot at
General Walker. It was a factor which contributed to his character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
and thereby might have influenced his decision to assassinate President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>The discussion below will describe the events known to the Commission
which most clearly reveals the formation and nature of Oswald’s
character. It will attempt to summarize the events of his early life,
his experience in New York City and in the Marine Corps, and his interest
in Marxism. It will examine his defection to the Soviet Union
in 1959, his subsequent return to the United States and his life here
after June of 1962. The review of the latter period will evaluate his
personal and employment relations, his attempt to kill General Walker,
his political activities, and his unsuccessful attempt to go to Cuba in
late September of 1963. Various possible motives will be treated in
the appropriate context of the discussion outlined above.</p>

<h3 id="hdr140">The Early Years</h3>

<p>Significant in shaping the character of Lee Harvey Oswald was
the death of his father, a collector of insurance premiums. This
occurred 2 months before Lee was born in New Orleans on October 18,
1939.<a id="FNanchor_C7-12" href="#Footnote_C7-12" class="fnanchor">C7-12</a> That death strained the financial fortunes of the remainder
of the Oswald family. It had its effect on Lee’s mother, Marguerite,
his brother Robert, who had been born in 1934, and his half-brother
John Pic, who had been born in 1932 during Marguerite’s previous marriage.<a id="FNanchor_C7-13" href="#Footnote_C7-13" class="fnanchor">C7-13</a>
It forced Marguerite Oswald to go to work to provide for
her family.<a id="FNanchor_C7-14" href="#Footnote_C7-14" class="fnanchor">C7-14</a> Reminding her sons that they were orphans and that
the family’s financial condition was poor, she placed John Pic and
Robert Oswald in an orphans’ home.<a id="FNanchor_C7-15" href="#Footnote_C7-15" class="fnanchor">C7-15</a> From the time Marguerite
Oswald returned to work until December 26, 1942, when Lee too was
sent to the orphans’ home, he was cared for principally by his mother’s
sister, by babysitters and by his mother, when she had time for him.<a id="FNanchor_C7-16" href="#Footnote_C7-16" class="fnanchor">C7-16</a></p>

<p>Marguerite Oswald withdrew Lee from the orphans’ home and took
him with her to Dallas when he was a little over 4 years old.<a id="FNanchor_C7-17" href="#Footnote_C7-17" class="fnanchor">C7-17</a> About
6 months later she also withdrew John Pic and Robert Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C7-18" href="#Footnote_C7-18" class="fnanchor">C7-18</a> Apparently
that action was taken in anticipation of her marriage to
Edwin A. Ekdahl, which took place in May of 1945.<a id="FNanchor_C7-19" href="#Footnote_C7-19" class="fnanchor">C7-19</a> In the fall of
that year John Pic and Robert Oswald went to a military academy
where they stayed, except for vacations, until the spring of 1948.<a id="FNanchor_C7-20" href="#Footnote_C7-20" class="fnanchor">C7-20</a>
Lee Oswald remained with his mother and Ekdahl,<a id="FNanchor_C7-21" href="#Footnote_C7-21" class="fnanchor">C7-21</a> to whom he became
quite attached. John Pic testified that he thought Lee found
in Ekdahl the father that he never had.<a id="FNanchor_C7-22" href="#Footnote_C7-22" class="fnanchor">C7-22</a> That situation, however,
was short-lived, for the relations between Marguerite Oswald and
Ekdahl were stormy and they were finally divorced, after several
separations and reunions, in the summer of 1948.<a id="FNanchor_C7-23" href="#Footnote_C7-23" class="fnanchor">C7-23</a></p>

<p>After the divorce Mrs. Oswald complained considerably about how
unfairly she was treated, dwelling on the fact that she was a widow
with three children. John Pic, however, did not think her position
was worse than that of many other people.<a id="FNanchor_C7-24" href="#Footnote_C7-24" class="fnanchor">C7-24</a> In the fall of 1948 she
told John Pic and Robert Oswald that she could not afford to send
them back to the military school and she asked Pic to quit school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
entirely to help support the family, which he did for 4 months in the
fall of 1948.<a id="FNanchor_C7-25" href="#Footnote_C7-25" class="fnanchor">C7-25</a> In order to supplement their income further she falsely
swore that Pic was 17 years old so that he could join the Marine Corps
Reserves.<a id="FNanchor_C7-26" href="#Footnote_C7-26" class="fnanchor">C7-26</a> Pic did turn over part of his income to his mother, but he
returned to high school in January of 1949, where he stayed until 3
days before he was scheduled to graduate, when he left school in order
to get into the Coast Guard.<a id="FNanchor_C7-27" href="#Footnote_C7-27" class="fnanchor">C7-27</a> Since his mother did not approve of
his decision to continue school he accepted the responsibility for that
decision himself and signed his mother’s name to all his own excuses and
report cards.<a id="FNanchor_C7-28" href="#Footnote_C7-28" class="fnanchor">C7-28</a></p>

<p>Pic thought that his mother overstated her financial problems and
was unduly concerned about money. Referring to the period after
the divorce from Ekdahl, which was apparently caused in part by
Marguerite’s desire to get more money from him, Pic said: “Lee was
brought up in this atmosphere of constant money problems, and I am
sure it had quite an effect on him, and also Robert.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-29" href="#Footnote_C7-29" class="fnanchor">C7-29</a> Marguerite
Oswald worked in miscellaneous jobs after her divorce from Ekdahl.<a id="FNanchor_C7-30" href="#Footnote_C7-30" class="fnanchor">C7-30</a>
When she worked for a time as an insurance saleslady, she would sometimes
take Lee with her, apparently leaving him alone in the car while
she transacted her business.<a id="FNanchor_C7-31" href="#Footnote_C7-31" class="fnanchor">C7-31</a> When she worked during the school
year, Lee had to leave an empty house in the morning, return to it for
lunch and then again at night, his mother having trained him to do
that rather than to play with other children.<a id="FNanchor_C7-32" href="#Footnote_C7-32" class="fnanchor">C7-32</a></p>

<p>An indication of the nature of Lee’s character at this time was provided
in the spring of 1950, when he was sent to New Orleans to visit
the family of his mother’s sister, Mrs. Lillian Murret, for 2 or 3
weeks. Despite their urgings, he refused to play with the other
children his own age.<a id="FNanchor_C7-33" href="#Footnote_C7-33" class="fnanchor">C7-33</a> It also appears that Lee tried to tag along
with his older brothers but apparently was not able to spend as much
time with them as he would have liked, because of the age gaps of 5
and 7 years, which became more significant as the children grew
older.<a id="FNanchor_C7-34" href="#Footnote_C7-34" class="fnanchor">C7-34</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr141">New York City</h3>

<p>Whatever problems may have been created by Lee’s home life in
Louisiana and Texas, he apparently adjusted well enough there to
have had an average, although gradually deteriorating, school record
with no behavior or truancy problems. That was not the case, however,
after he and his mother moved to New York in August of 1952,
shortly before Lee’s 13th birthday. They moved shortly after Robert
joined the Marines; they lived for a time with John Pic who was
stationed there with the Coast Guard.<a id="FNanchor_C7-35" href="#Footnote_C7-35" class="fnanchor">C7-35</a> Relations soon became
strained, however,<a id="FNanchor_C7-36" href="#Footnote_C7-36" class="fnanchor">C7-36</a> so in late September Lee and his mother moved
to their own apartment in the Bronx.<a id="FNanchor_C7-37" href="#Footnote_C7-37" class="fnanchor">C7-37</a> Pic and his wife would
have been happy to have kept Lee, however, who was becoming quite
a disciplinary problem for his mother, having struck her on at least
one occasion.<a id="FNanchor_C7-38" href="#Footnote_C7-38" class="fnanchor">C7-38</a></p>

<p>The short-lived stay with the Pics was terminated after an incident
in which Lee allegedly pulled out a pocket knife during an argument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
and threatened to use it on Mrs. Pic. When Pic returned home, Mrs.
Oswald tried to play down the event but Mrs. Pic took a different view
and asked the Oswalds to leave. Lee refused to discuss the matter with
Pic, whom he had previously idolized, and their relations were strained
thereafter.<a id="FNanchor_C7-39" href="#Footnote_C7-39" class="fnanchor">C7-39</a></p>

<p>On September 30, 1952, Lee enrolled in P.S. 117,<a id="FNanchor_C7-40" href="#Footnote_C7-40" class="fnanchor">C7-40</a> a junior high
school in the Bronx, where the other children apparently teased him because
of his “western” clothes and Texas accent.<a id="FNanchor_C7-41" href="#Footnote_C7-41" class="fnanchor">C7-41</a> He began to stay
away from school, preferring to read magazines and watch television at
home by himself.<a id="FNanchor_C7-42" href="#Footnote_C7-42" class="fnanchor">C7-42</a> This continued despite the efforts of the school
authorities and, to a lesser extent, of his mother to have him return to
school.<a id="FNanchor_C7-43" href="#Footnote_C7-43" class="fnanchor">C7-43</a> Truancy charges were brought against him alleging that he
was “beyond the control of his mother insofar as school attendance is
concerned.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-44" href="#Footnote_C7-44" class="fnanchor">C7-44</a> Lee Oswald was remanded for psychiatric observation
to Youth House, an institution in which children are kept for psychiatric
observation or for detention pending court appearance or commitment
to a child-caring or custodial institution such as a training
school.<a id="FNanchor_C7-45" href="#Footnote_C7-45" class="fnanchor">C7-45</a> He was in Youth House from April 16 to May 7, 1953,<a id="FNanchor_C7-46" href="#Footnote_C7-46" class="fnanchor">C7-46</a>
during which time he was examined by its Chief Psychiatrist, Dr.
Renatus Hartogs, and interviewed and observed by other members of
the Youth House staff.<a id="FNanchor_C7-47" href="#Footnote_C7-47" class="fnanchor">C7-47</a></p>

<p>Marguerite Oswald visited her son at Youth House, where she recalled
that she waited in line “with Puerto Ricans and Negroes and
everything.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-48" href="#Footnote_C7-48" class="fnanchor">C7-48</a> She said that her pocketbook was searched “because
the children in this home were such criminals, dope fiends, and had
been in criminal offenses, that anybody entering this home had to be
searched in case the parents were bringing cigarettes or narcotics or
anything.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-49" href="#Footnote_C7-49" class="fnanchor">C7-49</a> She recalled that Lee cried and said, “Mother, I want to
get out of here. There are children in here who have killed people,
and smoke. I want to get out.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-50" href="#Footnote_C7-50" class="fnanchor">C7-50</a> Marguerite Oswald said that she
had not realized until then in what kind of place her son had been
confined.<a id="FNanchor_C7-51" href="#Footnote_C7-51" class="fnanchor">C7-51</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, Lee told his probation officer, John Carro, that
“while he liked Youth House he miss[ed] the freedom of doing what
he wanted. He indicated that he did not miss his mother.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-52" href="#Footnote_C7-52" class="fnanchor">C7-52</a> Mrs.
Evelyn Strickman Siegel, a social worker who interviewed both Lee
and his mother while Lee was confined in Youth House, reported
that Lee “confided that the worse thing about Youth House was the
fact that he had to be with other boys all the time, was disturbed about
disrobing in front of them, taking showers with them etc.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-53" href="#Footnote_C7-53" class="fnanchor">C7-53</a></p>

<p>Contrary to reports that appeared after the assassination, the psychiatric
examination did not indicate that Lee Oswald was a potential
assassin, potentially dangerous, that “his outlook on life had
strongly paranoid overtones” or that he should be institutionalized.<a id="FNanchor_C7-54" href="#Footnote_C7-54" class="fnanchor">C7-54</a>
Dr. Hartogs did find Oswald to be a tense, withdrawn, and evasive
boy who intensely disliked talking about himself and his feelings.
He noted that Lee liked to give the impression that he did not care
for other people but preferred to keep to himself, so that he was not
bothered and did not have to make the effort of communicating. Oswald’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
withdrawn tendencies and solitary habits were thought to be
the result of “intense anxiety, shyness, feelings of awkwardness
and insecurity.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-55" href="#Footnote_C7-55" class="fnanchor">C7-55</a> He was reported to have said “I don’t want a
friend and I don’t like to talk to people” and “I dislike everybody.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-56" href="#Footnote_C7-56" class="fnanchor">C7-56</a>
He was also described as having a “vivid fantasy life, turning around
the topics of omnipotence and power, through which he tries to compensate
for his present shortcomings and frustrations.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-57" href="#Footnote_C7-57" class="fnanchor">C7-57</a> Dr. Hartogs
summarized his report by stating:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This 13 year old well built boy has superior mental resources
and functions only slightly below his capacity level in spite of
chronic truancy from school which brought him into Youth
House. No finding of neurological impairment or psychotic
mental changes could be made. Lee has to be diagnosed as “personality
pattern disturbance with schizoid features and passive-aggressive
tendencies.” Lee has to be seen as an emotionally, quite
disturbed youngster who suffers under the impact of really existing
emotional isolation and deprivation, lack of affection, absence
of family life and rejection by a self involved and conflicted
mother.<a id="FNanchor_C7-58" href="#Footnote_C7-58" class="fnanchor">C7-58</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Dr. Hartogs recommended that Oswald be placed on probation on
condition that he seek help and guidance through a child guidance
clinic. There, he suggested, Lee should be treated by a male psychiatrist
who could substitute for the lack of a father figure. He also
recommended that Mrs. Oswald seek “psychotherapeutic guidance
through contact with a family agency.” The possibility of commitment
was to be considered only if the probation plan was not successful.<a id="FNanchor_C7-59" href="#Footnote_C7-59" class="fnanchor">C7-59</a></p>

<p>Lee’s withdrawal was also noted by Mrs. Siegel, who described him
as a “seriously detached, withdrawn youngster.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-60" href="#Footnote_C7-60" class="fnanchor">C7-60</a> She also noted
that there was “a rather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally
starved, affectionless youngster which grows as one speaks
to him.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-61" href="#Footnote_C7-61" class="fnanchor">C7-61</a> She thought that he had detached himself from the world
around him because “no one in it ever met any of his needs for love.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-62" href="#Footnote_C7-62" class="fnanchor">C7-62</a>
She observed that since Lee’s mother worked all day, he made his
own meals and spent all his time alone because he didn’t make friends
with the boys in the neighborhood. She thought that he “withdrew
into a completely solitary and detached existence where he did as he
wanted and he didn’t have to live by any rules or come into contact
with people.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-63" href="#Footnote_C7-63" class="fnanchor">C7-63</a> Mrs. Siegel concluded that Lee “just felt that
his mother never gave a damn for him. He always felt like a burden
that she simply just had to tolerate.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-64" href="#Footnote_C7-64" class="fnanchor">C7-64</a> Lee confirmed some of
those observations by saying that he felt almost as if there were a
veil between him and other people through which they could not
reach him, but that he preferred the veil to remain intact. He admitted
to fantasies about being powerful and sometimes hurting and
killing people, but refused to elaborate on them. He took the position
that such matters were his own business.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span><a id="FNanchor_C7-65" href="#Footnote_C7-65" class="fnanchor">C7-65</a></p>

<p>A psychological human figure-drawing test corroborated the interviewer’s
findings that Lee was insecure and had limited social contacts.
Irving Sokolow, a Youth House psychologist reported that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Human Figure Drawings are empty, poor characterizations
of persons approximately the same age as the subject. They
reflect a considerable amount of impoverishment in the social and
emotional areas. He appears to be a somewhat insecure youngster
exhibiting much inclination for warm and satisfying relationships
to others. There is some indication that he may relate to
men more easily than to women in view of the more mature conceptualisation.
He appears slightly withdrawn and in view of
the lack of detail within the drawings this may assume a more
significant characteristic. He exhibits some difficulty in relationship
to the maternal figure suggesting more anxiety in this area
than in any other.<a id="FNanchor_C7-66" href="#Footnote_C7-66" class="fnanchor">C7-66</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lee scored an IQ of 118 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.
According to Sokolow, this indicated a “present intellectual
functioning in the upper range of bright normal intelligence.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-67" href="#Footnote_C7-67" class="fnanchor">C7-67</a>
Sokolow said that although Lee was “presumably disinterested in
school subjects he operates on a much higher than average level.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-68" href="#Footnote_C7-68" class="fnanchor">C7-68</a>
On the Monroe Silent Reading Test, Lee’s score indicated no retardation
in reading speed and comprehension; he had better than average
ability in arithmetical reasoning for his age group.<a id="FNanchor_C7-69" href="#Footnote_C7-69" class="fnanchor">C7-69</a></p>

<p>Lee told Carro, his probation officer, that he liked to be by himself because
he had too much difficulty in making friends.<a id="FNanchor_C7-70" href="#Footnote_C7-70" class="fnanchor">C7-70</a> The reports
of Carro and Mrs. Siegel also indicate an ambivalent attitude toward
authority on Oswald’s part. Carro reported that Lee was disruptive
in class after he returned to school on a regular basis in the fall of
1953. He had refused to salute the flag and was doing very little, if
any, work. It appears that he did not want to do any of the things
which the authorities suggested in their efforts to bring him out of the
shell into which he appeared to be retreating.<a id="FNanchor_C7-71" href="#Footnote_C7-71" class="fnanchor">C7-71</a> He told Mrs. Siegel
that he would run away if sent to a boarding school. On the other
hand he also told her that he wished his mother had been more firm
with him in her attempts to get him to return to school.<a id="FNanchor_C7-72" href="#Footnote_C7-72" class="fnanchor">C7-72</a></p>

<p>The reports of the New York authorities indicate that Lee’s
mother gave him very little affection and did not serve as any sort
of substitute for a father. Furthermore she did not appear to understand
her own relationship to Lee’s psychological problems. After
her interview with Mrs. Oswald, Mrs. Siegel described her as a “smartly
dressed, gray haired woman, very self-possessed and alert and superficially
affable,” but essentially a “defensive, rigid, self-involved person
who had real difficulty in accepting and relating to people” and who
had “little understanding” of Lee’s behavior and of the “protective
shell he has drawn around himself.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-73" href="#Footnote_C7-73" class="fnanchor">C7-73</a> Dr. Hartogs reported that Mrs.
Oswald did not understand that Lee’s withdrawal was a form of “violent
but silent protest against his neglect by her and represents his reaction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
to a complete absence of any real family life.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-74" href="#Footnote_C7-74" class="fnanchor">C7-74</a> Carro reported
that when questioned about his mother Lee said, “well I’ve got
to live with her. I guess I love her.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-75" href="#Footnote_C7-75" class="fnanchor">C7-75</a> It may also be significant that,
as reported by John Pic, “Lee slept with my mother until I joined the
service in 1950. This would make him approximately 10, well, almost
11 years old.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-76" href="#Footnote_C7-76" class="fnanchor">C7-76</a></p>

<p>The factors in Lee Oswald’s personality which were noted by those
who had contact with him in New York indicate that he had great
difficulty in adapting himself to conditions in that city. His usual
reaction to the problems which he encountered there was simply
withdrawal. Those factors indicated a severe inability to enter
into relationships with other people. In view of his experiences when
he visited his relatives in New Orleans in the spring of 1950, and his
other solitary habits, Lee had apparently been experiencing similar
problems before going to New York, and as will be shown below, this
failure to adapt to his environment was a dominant trait in his later
life.</p>

<p>It would be incorrect, however, to believe that those aspects of Lee’s
personality which were observed in New York could have led anyone
to predict the outburst of violence which finally occurred. Carro was
the only one of Oswald’s three principal observers who recommended
that he be placed in a boy’s home or similar institution.<a id="FNanchor_C7-77" href="#Footnote_C7-77" class="fnanchor">C7-77</a> But Carro
was quite specific that his recommendation was based primarily on the
adverse factors in Lee’s environment—his lack of friends, the apparent
unavailability of any agency assistance and the ineffectualness of his
mother—and not on any particular mental disturbance in the boy
himself.<a id="FNanchor_C7-78" href="#Footnote_C7-78" class="fnanchor">C7-78</a> Carro testified that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There was nothing that would lead me to believe when I saw
him at the age of 12 that there would be seeds of destruction for
somebody. I couldn’t in all honesty sincerely say such a thing.<a id="FNanchor_C7-79" href="#Footnote_C7-79" class="fnanchor">C7-79</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Mrs. Siegel concluded her report with the statement that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Despite his withdrawal, he gives the impression that he is not
so difficult to reach as he appears and patient, prolonged effort
in a sustained relationship with one therapist might bring results.
There are indications that he has suffered serious personality
damage but if he can receive help quickly this might be
repaired to some extent.<a id="FNanchor_C7-80" href="#Footnote_C7-80" class="fnanchor">C7-80</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lee Oswald never received that help. Few social agencies even
in New York were equipped to provide the kind of intensive treatment
that he needed, and when one of the city’s clinics did find room
to handle him, for some reason the record does not show, advantage was
never taken of the chance afforded to Oswald. When Lee became a disciplinary
problem upon his return to school in the fall of 1953, and
when his mother failed to cooperate in any way with school authorities,
authorities were finally forced to consider placement in a home for
boys. Such a placement was postponed, however, perhaps in part at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
least because Lee’s behavior suddenly improved. Before the court took
any action, the Oswalds left New York<a id="FNanchor_C7-81" href="#Footnote_C7-81" class="fnanchor">C7-81</a> in January of 1954, and returned
to New Orleans where Lee finished the ninth grade before he
left school to work for a year.<a id="FNanchor_C7-82" href="#Footnote_C7-82" class="fnanchor">C7-82</a> Then in October of 1956, he joined
the Marines.<a id="FNanchor_C7-83" href="#Footnote_C7-83" class="fnanchor">C7-83</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr142">Return to New Orleans and Joining the Marine Corps</h3>

<p>After his return to New Orleans Oswald was teased at school because
of the northern accent which he had acquired.<a id="FNanchor_C7-84" href="#Footnote_C7-84" class="fnanchor">C7-84</a> He concluded that
school had nothing to offer him.<a id="FNanchor_C7-85" href="#Footnote_C7-85" class="fnanchor">C7-85</a> His mother exercised little control
over him and thought he could decide for himself whether to go on in
school.<a id="FNanchor_C7-86" href="#Footnote_C7-86" class="fnanchor">C7-86</a> Neighbors and others who knew him at that time recall an
introverted boy who read a great deal.<a id="FNanchor_C7-87" href="#Footnote_C7-87" class="fnanchor">C7-87</a> He took walks and visited
museums, and sometimes rode a rented bicycle in the park on Saturday
mornings.<a id="FNanchor_C7-88" href="#Footnote_C7-88" class="fnanchor">C7-88</a> Mrs. Murret believes that he talked at length with a girl
on the telephone, but no one remembers that he had any dates.<a id="FNanchor_C7-89" href="#Footnote_C7-89" class="fnanchor">C7-89</a> A
friend, Edward Voebel, testified that “he was more bashful about girls
than anything else.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-90" href="#Footnote_C7-90" class="fnanchor">C7-90</a></p>

<p>Several witnesses testified that Lee Oswald was not aggressive.<a id="FNanchor_C7-91" href="#Footnote_C7-91" class="fnanchor">C7-91</a> He
was, however, involved in some fights. Once a group of white boys beat
him up for sitting in the Negro section of a bus, which he apparently
did simply out of ignorance.<a id="FNanchor_C7-92" href="#Footnote_C7-92" class="fnanchor">C7-92</a> Another time, he fought with two
brothers who claimed that he had picked on the younger of them, 3
years Oswald’s junior. Two days later, “some big guy, probably from
a high school—he looked like a tremendous football player” accosted
Oswald on the way home from school and punched him in the mouth,
making his lip bleed and loosening a tooth. Voebel took Oswald back
to the school to attend to his wounds, and their “mild friendship”
stemmed from that incident.<a id="FNanchor_C7-93" href="#Footnote_C7-93" class="fnanchor">C7-93</a> Voebel also recalled that Oswald once
outlined a plan to cut the glass in the window of a store on Rampart
Street and steal a pistol, but he was not sure then that Oswald meant to
carry out the plan, and in fact they never did. Voebel said that
Oswald “wouldn’t start any fights, but if you wanted to start one with
him, he was going to make sure that he ended it, or you were going
to really have one, because he wasn’t going to take anything from
anybody.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-94" href="#Footnote_C7-94" class="fnanchor">C7-94</a> In a space for the names of “close friends” on the ninth
grade personal history record, Oswald first wrote “Edward Vogel,”
an obvious misspelling of Voebel’s name, and “Arthor Abear,” most
likely Arthur Hebert, a classmate who has said that he did not
know Oswald well. Oswald erased those names, however, and indicated
that he had no close friends.<a id="FNanchor_C7-95" href="#Footnote_C7-95" class="fnanchor">C7-95</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested that this misspelling of names, apparently on
a phonetic basis, was caused by a reading-spelling disability from
which Oswald appeared to suffer.<a id="FNanchor_C7-96" href="#Footnote_C7-96" class="fnanchor">C7-96</a> Other evidence of the existence
of such a disability is provided by the many other misspellings that
appear in Oswald’s writings, portions of which are quoted below.</p>

<p>Sometime during this period, and under circumstances to be discussed
more fully below, Oswald started to read Communist literature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
which he obtained from the public library.<a id="FNanchor_C7-97" href="#Footnote_C7-97" class="fnanchor">C7-97</a> One of his fellow
employees, Palmer McBride, stated that Oswald said he would
like to kill President Eisenhower because he was exploiting the working
class.<a id="FNanchor_C7-98" href="#Footnote_C7-98" class="fnanchor">C7-98</a> Oswald praised Khrushchev and suggested that he and
McBride join the Communist Party “to take advantage of their social
functions.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-99" href="#Footnote_C7-99" class="fnanchor">C7-99</a> Oswald also became interested in the New Orleans
Amateur Astronomy Association, an organization of high school students.
The association’s then president, William E. Wulf, testified
that he remembered an occasion when Oswald</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * started expounding the Communist doctrine and saying
that he was highly interested in communism, that communism
was the only way of life for the worker, et cetera, and then came
out with a statement that he was looking for a Communist cell in
town to join but he couldn’t find any. He was a little dismayed
at this, and he said that he couldn’t find any that would show any
interest in him as a Communist, and subsequently, after this
conversation, my father came in and we were kind of arguing
back and forth about the situation, and my father came in the
room, heard what we were arguing on communism, and that this
boy was loud-mouthed, boisterous, and my father asked him to
leave the house and politely put him out of the house, and that
is the last I have seen or spoken with Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C7-100" href="#Footnote_C7-100" class="fnanchor">C7-100</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Despite this apparent interest in communism, Oswald tried
to join the Marines when he was 16 years old.<a id="FNanchor_C7-101" href="#Footnote_C7-101" class="fnanchor">C7-101</a> This was 1
year before his actual enlistment and just a little over 2½ years
after he left New York. He wrote a note in his mother’s name
to school authorities in New Orleans saying that he was leaving school
because he and his mother were moving to San Diego. In fact, he had
quit school in an attempt to obtain his mother’s assistance to join the
Marines.<a id="FNanchor_C7-102" href="#Footnote_C7-102" class="fnanchor">C7-102</a> While he apparently was able to induce his mother to
make a false statement about his age he was nevertheless unable to
convince the proper authorities that he was really 17 years old.<a id="FNanchor_C7-103" href="#Footnote_C7-103" class="fnanchor">C7-103</a>
There is evidence that Oswald was greatly influenced in his decision to
join the Marines by the fact that his brother Robert had done so approximately
3 years before.<a id="FNanchor_C7-104" href="#Footnote_C7-104" class="fnanchor">C7-104</a> Robert Oswald had given his Marine
Corps manual to his brother Lee, who studied it during the year following
his unsuccessful attempt to enlist until “He knew it by
heart.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-105" href="#Footnote_C7-105" class="fnanchor">C7-105</a> According to Marguerite Oswald, “Lee lived for the time
that he would become 17 years old to join the Marines—that whole
year.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-106" href="#Footnote_C7-106" class="fnanchor">C7-106</a> In John Pic’s view, Oswald was motivated to join the
Marines in large part by a desire “to get from out and under * * *
the yoke of oppression from my mother.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-107" href="#Footnote_C7-107" class="fnanchor">C7-107</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s inability or lack of desire to enter into meaningful relationships
with other people continued during this period in New
Orleans (1954-56).<a id="FNanchor_C7-108" href="#Footnote_C7-108" class="fnanchor">C7-108</a> It probably contributed greatly to the general
dissatisfaction which he exhibited with his environment, a dissatisfaction
which seemed to find expression at this particular point in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
intense desire to join the Marines and get away from his surroundings
and his mother. His study of Communist literature, which might
appear to be inconsistent with his desire to join the Marines, could have
been another manifestation of Oswald’s rejection of his environment.<a id="FNanchor_C7-109" href="#Footnote_C7-109" class="fnanchor">C7-109</a></p>

<p>His difficulty in relating to other people and his general dissatisfaction
with the world around him continued while he was in the Marine
Corps. Kerry Thornley, a marine associate, who, shortly after Oswald’s
defection, wrote an as yet unpublished novel based in considerable
part on Oswald’s life, testified that “definitely the Marine Corps
was not what he had expected it to be when he joined.” He said
that Oswald “seemed to guard against developing real close friendships.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-110" href="#Footnote_C7-110" class="fnanchor">C7-110</a>
Daniel Powers, another marine who was stationed with
Oswald for part of his marine career, testified that Oswald seemed
“always [to be] striving for a relationship, but whenever he did * * *
his general personality would alienate the group against him.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-111" href="#Footnote_C7-111" class="fnanchor">C7-111</a>
Other marines also testified that Oswald had few friends and kept
very much to himself.<a id="FNanchor_C7-112" href="#Footnote_C7-112" class="fnanchor">C7-112</a></p>

<p>While there is nothing in Oswald’s military records to indicate that
he was mentally unstable or otherwise psychologically unfit for duty in
the Marine Corps,<a id="FNanchor_C7-113" href="#Footnote_C7-113" class="fnanchor">C7-113</a> he did not adjust well to conditions which
he found in that service.<a id="FNanchor_C7-114" href="#Footnote_C7-114" class="fnanchor">C7-114</a> He did not rise above the rank of
private first class, even though he had passed a qualifying examination
for the rank of corporal.<a id="FNanchor_C7-115" href="#Footnote_C7-115" class="fnanchor">C7-115</a> His Marine career was not
helped by his attitude that he was a man of great ability and intelligence
and that many of his superiors in the Marine Corps were not
sufficiently competent to give him orders.<a id="FNanchor_C7-116" href="#Footnote_C7-116" class="fnanchor">C7-116</a> While Oswald did not
seem to object to authority in the abstract, he did think that he should
be the one to exercise it. John E. Donovan, one of his former officers,
testified that Oswald thought “that authority, particularly the Marine
Corps, ought to be able to recognize talent such as his own, without a
given magic college degree, and put them in positions of prominence.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-117" href="#Footnote_C7-117" class="fnanchor">C7-117</a></p>

<p>Oswald manifested this feeling about authority by baiting his officers.
He led them into discussions of foreign affairs about which they
often knew less than he did, since he had apparently devoted considerable
time to a study of such matters.<a id="FNanchor_C7-118" href="#Footnote_C7-118" class="fnanchor">C7-118</a> When the officers were unable to
discuss foreign affairs satisfactorily with him, Oswald regarded them
as unfit to exercise command over him.<a id="FNanchor_C7-119" href="#Footnote_C7-119" class="fnanchor">C7-119</a> Nelson Delgado, one of Oswald’s
fellow Marines, testified that Oswald tried to “cut up anybody
that was high ranking” in those arguments “and make himself come
out top dog.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-120" href="#Footnote_C7-120" class="fnanchor">C7-120</a> Oswald probably engaged his superiors in arguments
on a subject that he had studied in an attempt to attract attention to
himself and to support his exaggerated idea of his own abilities.</p>

<p>Thornley also testified that he thought that Oswald’s extreme personal
sloppiness in the Marine Corps “fitted into a general personality
pattern of his: to do whatever was not wanted of him, a recalcitrant
trend in his personality.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-121" href="#Footnote_C7-121" class="fnanchor">C7-121</a> Oswald “seemed to be a person who
would go out of his way to get into trouble”<a id="FNanchor_C7-122" href="#Footnote_C7-122" class="fnanchor">C7-122</a> and then used the
“special treatment” he received as an example of the way in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
he was being picked on and “as a means of getting or attempting
to get sympathy.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-123" href="#Footnote_C7-123" class="fnanchor">C7-123</a> In Thornley’s view, Oswald labored under a persecution
complex which he strove to maintain and “felt the Marine
Corps kept a pretty close watch on him because of his ‘subversive’
activities.” Thornley added: “I think it was kind of necessary to him
to believe that he was being picked on. It wasn’t anything extreme.
I wouldn’t go as far as to call it, call him a paranoid, but a definite
tendency there was in that direction, I think.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-124" href="#Footnote_C7-124" class="fnanchor">C7-124</a></p>

<p>Powers considered Oswald to be meek and easily led,<a id="FNanchor_C7-125" href="#Footnote_C7-125" class="fnanchor">C7-125</a> an “individual
that you would brainwash, and quite easy * * * [but] I think
once he believed in something * * * he stood in his beliefs.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-126" href="#Footnote_C7-126" class="fnanchor">C7-126</a> Powers
also testified that Oswald was reserved and seemed to be “somewhat
the frail, little puppy in the litter.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-127" href="#Footnote_C7-127" class="fnanchor">C7-127</a> He had the nickname “Ozzie
Rabbit.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-128" href="#Footnote_C7-128" class="fnanchor">C7-128</a></p>

<p>Oswald read a good deal, said Powers, but “he would never be
reading any of the shoot-em-up westerns or anything like that. Normally,
it would be a good type of literature; and the one that I recall
was ‘Leaves of Grass,’ by Walt Whitman.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-129" href="#Footnote_C7-129" class="fnanchor">C7-129</a> According to Powers,
Oswald said: “‘All the Marine Corps did was to teach you to kill’ and
after you got out of the Marines you might be good gangsters.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-130" href="#Footnote_C7-130" class="fnanchor">C7-130</a>
Powers believed that when Oswald arrived in Japan he acquired a
girlfriend, “finally attaining a male status or image in his own
eyes.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-131" href="#Footnote_C7-131" class="fnanchor">C7-131</a> That apparently caused Oswald to become more self-confident,
aggressive and even somewhat pugnacious, although Powers
“wouldn’t say that this guy is a troublemaker.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-132" href="#Footnote_C7-132" class="fnanchor">C7-132</a> Powers said
“now he was Oswald the man rather than Oswald the rabbit.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-133" href="#Footnote_C7-133" class="fnanchor">C7-133</a>
Oswald once told Powers that he didn’t care if he returned to the
United States at all.<a id="FNanchor_C7-134" href="#Footnote_C7-134" class="fnanchor">C7-134</a></p>

<p>While in Japan, Oswald’s new found apparent self confidence and
pugnaciousness led to an incident in which he spilled a drink on one
of his sergeants and abusively challenged him to fight.<a id="FNanchor_C7-135" href="#Footnote_C7-135" class="fnanchor">C7-135</a> At the court-martial
hearing which followed, Oswald admitted that he had been
rather drunk when the incident occurred. He testified that he had
felt the sergeant had a grudge against him and that he had unsuccessfully
sought a transfer from the sergeant’s unit. He said that he had
simply wanted to discuss the question with the sergeant and the drink
had been spilled accidentally. The hearing officer agreed with the
latter claim but found Oswald guilty of wrongfully using provoking
words and sentenced him to 28 days, canceling the suspension of a 20-day
sentence that Oswald had received in an earlier court-martial for
possessing an unauthorized pistol with which he had accidentally shot
himself.<a id="FNanchor_C7-136" href="#Footnote_C7-136" class="fnanchor">C7-136</a></p>

<p>At his own request, Oswald was transferred from active duty to
the Marine Corps Reserve under honorable conditions in September
of 1959, 3 months prior to his regularly scheduled separation date,<a id="FNanchor_C7-137" href="#Footnote_C7-137" class="fnanchor">C7-137</a>
ostensibly to care for his mother who had been injured in an accident
at her work.<a id="FNanchor_C7-138" href="#Footnote_C7-138" class="fnanchor">C7-138</a> He was undesirably discharged from the Marine
Corps Reserve, to which he had been assigned on inactive status following
his transfer from active duty, after it was learned that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
defected to the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_C7-139" href="#Footnote_C7-139" class="fnanchor">C7-139</a> In an attempt to have this discharge
reversed, Oswald wrote to then Secretary of the Navy Connally on
January 30, 1962, stating that he would “employ all means to right this
gross mistake or injustice.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-140" href="#Footnote_C7-140" class="fnanchor">C7-140</a></p>

<p>Governor Connally had just resigned to run for Governor of Texas,
so he advised Oswald that he had forwarded the letter to his successor.<a id="FNanchor_C7-141" href="#Footnote_C7-141" class="fnanchor">C7-141</a>
It is thus clear that Oswald knew that Governor Connally
was never directly concerned with his discharge and he must have
known that President Kennedy had had nothing to do with it. In
that connection, it does not appear that Oswald ever expressed any
dissatisfaction of any kind with either the President or Governor
Connally.<a id="FNanchor_C7-142" href="#Footnote_C7-142" class="fnanchor">C7-142</a> Marina Oswald testified that she “had never heard anything
bad about Kennedy from Lee. And he never had anything
against him.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-143" href="#Footnote_C7-143" class="fnanchor">C7-143</a> Mrs. Oswald said that her husband did not say anything
about Governor Connally after his return to the United States.
She testified: “But while we were in Russia he spoke well of him. * * *
Lee said that when he would return to the United States he would
vote for him [for Governor].”<a id="FNanchor_C7-144" href="#Footnote_C7-144" class="fnanchor">C7-144</a> Oswald must have already learned
that the Governor could not help him with his discharge because he
was no longer Secretary of the Navy, at the time he made that remark.</p>

<p>Even though Oswald apparently did not express any hostility
against the President or Governor Connally, he continued to be concerned
about his undesirable discharge.<a id="FNanchor_C7-145" href="#Footnote_C7-145" class="fnanchor">C7-145</a> It is clear that he thought
he had been unjustly treated. Probably his complaint was due to the
fact that his discharge was not related to anything he had done while
on active duty and also because he had not received any notice of the
original discharge proceedings, since his whereabouts were not
known.<a id="FNanchor_C7-146" href="#Footnote_C7-146" class="fnanchor">C7-146</a> He continued his efforts to reverse the discharge by petitioning
the Navy Discharge Review Board, which finally declined to
modify the discharge and so advised him in a letter dated July 25,
1963.<a id="FNanchor_C7-147" href="#Footnote_C7-147" class="fnanchor">C7-147</a></p>

<p>Governor Connally’s connection with the discharge, although indirect,
caused the Commission to consider whether he might have been
Oswald’s real target. In that connection, it should be noted that
Marina Oswald testified on September 6, 1964, that she thought her
husband “was shooting at Connally rather than President Kennedy.”
In support of her conclusion Mrs. Oswald noted her husband’s undesirable
discharge and that she could not think of any reason why
Oswald would want to kill President Kennedy.<a id="FNanchor_C7-148" href="#Footnote_C7-148" class="fnanchor">C7-148</a> It should be noted,
however, that at the time Oswald fired the shots at the Presidential
limousine the Governor occupied the seat in front of the President, and
it would have been almost impossible for Oswald to have hit the Governor
without hitting the President first. Oswald could have shot the
Governor as the car approached the Depository or as it was making the
turn onto Elm Street. Once it had started down Elm Street toward the
Triple Underpass, however, the President almost completely blocked
Oswald’s view of the Governor prior to the time the first shot struck the
President.<a id="FNanchor_C7-150" href="#Footnote_C7-150" class="fnanchor">C7-150</a> Furthermore, Oswald would have had other and more favorable
opportunities to strike at the Governor than on this occasion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
when, as a member of the President’s party, he had more protection
than usual. It would appear, therefore, that to the extent Oswald’s
undesirable discharge affected his motivation, it was more in terms
of a general hostility against the government and its representatives
rather than a grudge against any particular person.</p>

<h3 id="hdr143">Interest in Marxism</h3>

<p>As indicated above, Oswald started to read Communist literature
after he and his mother left New York and moved to New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_C7-151" href="#Footnote_C7-151" class="fnanchor">C7-151</a>
He told Aline Mosby, a reporter who interviewed him after he arrived
in Moscow:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I’m a Marxist, * * * I became interested about the age of 15.
From an ideological viewpoint. An old lady handed me a pamphlet
about saving the Rosenbergs. * * * I looked at that paper
and I still remember it for some reason, I don’t know why.<a id="FNanchor_C7-152" href="#Footnote_C7-152" class="fnanchor">C7-152</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Oswald studied Marxism after he joined the Marines and his sympathies
in that direction and for the Soviet Union appear to have
been widely known, at least in the unit to which he was assigned
after his return from the Far East. His interest in Russia led
some of his associates to call him “comrade”<a id="FNanchor_C7-153" href="#Footnote_C7-153" class="fnanchor">C7-153</a> or “Oswaldskovitch.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-154" href="#Footnote_C7-154" class="fnanchor">C7-154</a>
He always wanted to play the red pieces in chess because,
as he said in an apparently humorous context, he preferred the “Red
Army.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-155" href="#Footnote_C7-155" class="fnanchor">C7-155</a> He studied the Russian language,<a id="FNanchor_C7-156" href="#Footnote_C7-156" class="fnanchor">C7-156</a> read a Russian language
newspaper<a id="FNanchor_C7-157" href="#Footnote_C7-157" class="fnanchor">C7-157</a> and seemed interested in what was going on in
the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_C7-158" href="#Footnote_C7-158" class="fnanchor">C7-158</a> Thornley, who thought Oswald had an “irrevocable
conviction” that his Marxist beliefs were correct, testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think you could sit down and argue with him for a number of
years * * * and I don’t think you could have changed his mind
on that unless you knew why he believed it in the first place.
I certainly don’t. I don’t think with any kind of formal argument
you could have shaken that conviction. And that is why
I say irrevocable. It was just—never getting back to looking
at things from any other way once he had become a Marxist,
whenever that was.<a id="FNanchor_C7-159" href="#Footnote_C7-159" class="fnanchor">C7-159</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thornley also testified about an incident which grew out of a
combination of Oswald’s known Marxist sympathies and George
Orwell’s book “1984,” one of Oswald’s favorite books which Thornley
read at Oswald’s suggestion. Shortly after Thornley finished reading
that book the Marine unit to which both men were assigned
was required to take part in a Saturday morning parade in honor of
some retiring noncommissioned officers, an event which they both approached
with little enthusiasm. While waiting for the parade to
start they talked briefly about “1984” even though Oswald seemed
to be lost in his own thoughts. After a brief period of silence Oswald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
remarked on the stupidity of the parade and on how angry it
made him, to which Thornley replied: “Well, comes the revolution
you will change all that.” Thornley testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At which time he looked at me like a betrayed Caesar and
screamed, screamed definitely, “Not you, too, Thornley.” And
I remember his voice cracked as he said this. He was definitely
disturbed at what I had said and I didn’t really think I had said
that much. * * * I never said anything to him again and he
never said anything to me again.<a id="FNanchor_C7-160" href="#Footnote_C7-160" class="fnanchor">C7-160</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Thornley said that he had made his remark only in the context of
“1984” and had not intended any criticism of Oswald’s political views
which is the way in which, Thornley thought, Oswald took his
remarks.<a id="FNanchor_C7-161" href="#Footnote_C7-161" class="fnanchor">C7-161</a></p>

<p>Lieutenant Donovan testified that Oswald thought that “there were
many grave injustices concerning the affairs in the international situation.”
He recalled that Oswald had a specific interest in Latin
America, particularly Cuba, and expressed opposition to the Batista
regime and sympathy for Castro, an attitude which, Donovan said, was
“not * * * unpopular” at that time. Donovan testified that he never
heard Oswald express a desire personally to take part in the elimination
of injustices anywhere in the world and that he “never heard
him in any way, shape or form confess that he was a Communist, or
that he ever thought about being a Communist.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-162" href="#Footnote_C7-162" class="fnanchor">C7-162</a> Delgado testified
that Oswald was “a complete believer that our way of government was
not quite right” and believed that our Government did not have “too
much to offer,” but was not in favor of “the Communist way of life.”
Delgado and Oswald talked more about Cuba than Russia, and sometimes
imagined themselves as leaders in the Cuban Army or Government,
who might “lead an expedition to some of these other islands
and free them too.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-163" href="#Footnote_C7-163" class="fnanchor">C7-163</a></p>

<p>Thornley also believed that Oswald’s Marxist beliefs led to an
extraordinary view of history under which:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He looked upon the eyes of future people as some kind of tribunal,
and he wanted to be on the winning side so that 10,000 years from
now people would look in the history books and say, “Well, this
man was ahead of his time.” * * * The eyes of the future became
* * * the eyes of God. * * * He was concerned with his image
in history and I do think that is why he chose * * * the particular
method [of defecting] he chose and did it in the way he did.
It got him in the newspapers. It did broadcast his name out.<a id="FNanchor_C7-164" href="#Footnote_C7-164" class="fnanchor">C7-164</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Thornley thought that Oswald not only wanted a place in history
but also wanted to live comfortably in the present. He testified that
if Oswald could not have that “degree of physical comfort that he expected
or sought, I think he would then throw himself entirely on the
other thing he also wanted, which was the image in history. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>* * *
I think he wanted both if he could have them. If he didn’t, he wanted
to die with the knowledge that, or with the idea that he was
somebody.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-165" href="#Footnote_C7-165" class="fnanchor">C7-165</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s interest in Marxism led some people to avoid him, even
though as his wife suggested, that interest may have been motivated
by a desire to gain attention.<a id="FNanchor_C7-166" href="#Footnote_C7-166" class="fnanchor">C7-166</a> He used his Marxist and associated
activities as excuses for his difficulties in getting along in the world,
which were usually caused by entirely different factors. His use of
those excuses to present himself to the world as a person who was
being unfairly treated is shown most clearly by his employment relations
after his return from the Soviet Union. Of course, he made
his real problems worse to the extent that his use of those excuses
prevented him from discovering the real reasons for and attempting
to overcome his difficulties. Of greater importance, Oswald’s commitment
to Marxism contributed to the decisions which led him to
defect to the Soviet Union in 1959, and later to engage in activities
on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in the summer of 1963,
and to attempt to go to Cuba late in September of that year.</p>

<h3 id="hdr144">Defection to the Soviet Union</h3>

<p>After Oswald left the Marine Corps in September of 1959, ostensibly
to care for his mother, he almost immediately left for the Soviet
Union where he attempted to renounce his citizenship. At the age
of 19, Oswald thus committed an act which was the most striking
indication he had yet given of his willingness to act on his beliefs
in quite extraordinary ways.</p>

<p>While his defection resulted in part from Oswald’s commitment to
Marxism, it appears that personal and psychological factors were also
involved. On August 17, 1963, Oswald told Mr. William Stuckey, who
had arranged a radio debate on Oswald’s activities on behalf of the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee, that while he had begun to read Marx and
Engels at the age of 15,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">the conclusive thing that made him decide that Marxism was the
answer was his service in Japan. He said living conditions over
there convinced him something was wrong with the system, and
that possibly Marxism was the answer. He said it was in Japan
that he made up his mind to go to Russia and see for himself how
a revolutionary society operates, a Marxist society.<a id="FNanchor_C7-167" href="#Footnote_C7-167" class="fnanchor">C7-167</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">On the other hand, at least one person who knew Oswald after his
return thought that his defection had a more personal and psychological
basis.<a id="FNanchor_C7-168" href="#Footnote_C7-168" class="fnanchor">C7-168</a> The validity of the latter observation is borne out by
some of the things Oswald wrote in connection with his defection
indicating that his motivation was at least in part a personal one.
On November 26, 1959, shortly after he arrived in the Soviet Union,
and probably before Soviet authorities had given him permission to
stay indefinitely, he wrote to his brother Robert that the Soviet Union<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
was a country which “I have always considered * * * to be my own”
and that he went there “only to find freedom. * * * I could never
have been personally happy in the U.S.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-169" href="#Footnote_C7-169" class="fnanchor">C7-169</a> He wrote in another letter
that he would “never return to the United States which is a country
I hate.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-170" href="#Footnote_C7-170" class="fnanchor">C7-170</a> His idea that he was to find “freedom” in the Soviet
Union was to be rudely shattered.</p>

<p>Whatever Oswald’s reasons for going to the Soviet Union might
have been, however, there can be little doubt that his desire to go was
quite strong. In addition to studying the Russian language while
he was in the Marines, Oswald had managed to save enough money
to cover the expenses of his forthcoming trip. While there is no proof
that he saved $1,500, as he claimed, it would have taken considerable
discipline to save whatever amount was required to finance his defection
out of the salary of a low ranking enlisted man.<a id="FNanchor_C7-171" href="#Footnote_C7-171" class="fnanchor">C7-171</a></p>

<p>The extent of Oswald’s desire to go to the Soviet Union and of
his initial commitment to that country can best be understood, however,
in the context of his concomitant hatred of the United States,
which was most clearly expressed in his November 26, 1959, letter to
his brother Robert. Addressing himself to the question of why “I and
my fellow workers and communist’s would like to see the present
capitalist government of the U.S. overthrown” Oswald stated
that that government supported an economic system “which exploits
all its workers” and under which “art, culture and the sprit of
man are subjected to commercial enterpraising, [and] religion and
education are used as a tool to surpress what would otherwise be a
population questioning their government’s unfair economic system
and plans for war.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-172" href="#Footnote_C7-172" class="fnanchor">C7-172</a></p>

<p>He complained in his letter about segregation, unemployment, automation,
and the use of military forces to suppress other populations.
Asking his brother why he supported the American Government and
what ideals he put forward, Oswald wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ask me and I will tell you I fight for <em>communism</em>. * * * I will
not say your grandchildren will live under communism, look for
yourself at history, look at a world map! America is a dieing
country, I do not wish to be a part of it, nor do I ever again wish
to be used as a tool in its military aggressions.</p>

<p>This should ansewer your question, and also give you a glimpse
of my way of thinking.</p>

<p>So you speak of advantages. Do you think that is why I am
here? For personal, material advantages? Happiness is not
based on oneself, it does not consist of a small home, of taking and
getting, Happiness is taking part in the struggle, where there is
no borderline between one’s own personal world, and the world
in general. I never believed I would find more material advantages
at <em>this</em> stage of development in the Soviet Union than I
might of had in the U.S.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<blockquote>

<p>I have been a pro-communist for years and yet I have never
met a communist, instead I kept silent and observed, and what I
observed plus my Marx’ist learning brought me here to the Soviet
Union. I have always considered this country to be my own.<a id="FNanchor_C7-173" href="#Footnote_C7-173" class="fnanchor">C7-173</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Responding to Robert’s statement that he had not “renounced” him,
Oswald told his brother “on what terms I want this arrangement.”
He advised Robert that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. In the event of war I would kill <em>any</em> american who put a uniform
on in defence of the american government—any american.</p>

<p>2. That in my own mind I have no attachment’s of any kind in
the U.S.</p>

<p>3. That I want to, and I shall, live a normal happy and peaceful
life here in the Soviet Union <em>for the rest of my life</em>.</p>

<p>4. that my mother and you are (in spite of what the newspaper
said) <em>not</em> objects of affection, but only examples of workers in the
U.S.<a id="FNanchor_C7-174" href="#Footnote_C7-174" class="fnanchor">C7-174</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Despite this commitment to the Soviet Union Oswald met disappointments
there just as he had in the past. At the outset the Soviets
told him that he could not remain. It seems that Oswald immediately
attempted suicide—a striking indication of how much he desired to
remain in the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_C7-175" href="#Footnote_C7-175" class="fnanchor">C7-175</a> It shows how willing he was to act
dramatically and decisively when he faced an emotional crisis with
few readily available alternatives at hand. He was shocked to find
that the Soviet Union did not accept him with open arms. The entry
in his self-styled “Historic Diary” for October 21, 1959, reports:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am shocked!! My dreams! * * * I have waited for 2 year
to be accepted. My fondes dreams are shattered because of a
petty offial, * * * I decide to end it. Soak rist in cold water to
numb the pain. Than slash my leftwrist. Than plaug wrist into
bathtum of hot water. * * * Somewhere, a violin plays, as I wacth
my life whirl away. I think to myself “How easy to Die” and “A
Sweet Death, (to violins) * * *”<a id="FNanchor_C7-176" href="#Footnote_C7-176" class="fnanchor">C7-176</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Oswald was discovered in time to thwart his attempt at suicide.<a id="FNanchor_C7-177" href="#Footnote_C7-177" class="fnanchor">C7-177</a>
He was taken to a hospital in Moscow where he was kept until October
28, 1959.<a id="FNanchor_C7-178" href="#Footnote_C7-178" class="fnanchor">C7-178</a></p>

<p>Still intent, however, on staying in the Soviet Union, Oswald
went on October 31, to the American Embassy to renounce his U.S.
citizenship. Mr. Richard E. Snyder, then Second Secretary and senior
consular official at the Embassy, testified that Oswald was extremely
sure of himself and seemed “to know what his mission was. He took
charge, in a sense, of the conversation right from the beginning.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-179" href="#Footnote_C7-179" class="fnanchor">C7-179</a>
He presented the following signed note:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I Lee Harvey Oswald do hereby request that my present citizenship
in the United States of America, be revoked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
I have entered the Soviet Union for the express purpose of
appling for citizenship in the Soviet Union, through the means of
naturalization.</p>

<p>My request for citizenship is now pending before the Surprem
Soviet of the U.S.S.R..</p>

<p>I take these steps for political reasons. My request for the revoking
of my American citizenship is made only after the longest
and most serious considerations.</p>

<p>I affirm that my allegiance is to the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics.<a id="FNanchor_C7-180" href="#Footnote_C7-180" class="fnanchor">C7-180</a> (See Commission Exhibit 913, <a href="#Page_261">p. 261</a>.)</p></blockquote>

<p>As his “principal reason” for renouncing his citizenship Oswald
stated: “I am a Marxist.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-181" href="#Footnote_C7-181" class="fnanchor">C7-181</a> He also alluded to hardships endured
by his mother as a worker, referring to them as experiences that he did
not intend to have himself,<a id="FNanchor_C7-182" href="#Footnote_C7-182" class="fnanchor">C7-182</a> even though he stated that he had never
held a civilian job.<a id="FNanchor_C7-183" href="#Footnote_C7-183" class="fnanchor">C7-183</a> He said that his Marine service in Okinawa
and elsewhere had given him “a chance to observe ‘American imperialism.’”
but he also displayed some sensitivity at not having reached
a higher rank in the Marine Corps.<a id="FNanchor_C7-184" href="#Footnote_C7-184" class="fnanchor">C7-184</a> He stated that he had
volunteered to give Soviet officials any information that he had concerning
Marine Corps operations,<a id="FNanchor_C7-185" href="#Footnote_C7-185" class="fnanchor">C7-185</a> and intimated that he might know
something of special interest.<a id="FNanchor_C7-186" href="#Footnote_C7-186" class="fnanchor">C7-186</a> Oswald’s “Historic Diary” describes
the event in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I leave Embassy, elated at this showdown, returning to my
hotel I feel now my energies are not spent in vain. I’m sure
Russians will except me after this sign of my faith in them.<a id="FNanchor_C7-187" href="#Footnote_C7-187" class="fnanchor">C7-187</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Soviet authorities finally permitted Oswald to remain in their
country.<a id="FNanchor_C7-188" href="#Footnote_C7-188" class="fnanchor">C7-188</a> No evidence has been found that they used him for any
particular propaganda or other political or informational purposes.
They sent him to Minsk to work in a radio and television factory as a
metal worker.<a id="FNanchor_C7-189" href="#Footnote_C7-189" class="fnanchor">C7-189</a> The Soviet authorities denied Oswald permission to
attend a university in Moscow,<a id="FNanchor_C7-190" href="#Footnote_C7-190" class="fnanchor">C7-190</a> but they gave him a monthly allowance
of 700 rubles a month (old exchange rate)<a id="FNanchor_C7-191" href="#Footnote_C7-191" class="fnanchor">C7-191</a> in addition to his
factory salary of approximately equal amount<a id="FNanchor_C7-192" href="#Footnote_C7-192" class="fnanchor">C7-192</a> and considerably better
living quarters than those accorded to Soviet citizens of equal age
and station.<a id="FNanchor_C7-193" href="#Footnote_C7-193" class="fnanchor">C7-193</a> The subsidy, apparently similar to those sometimes
given to foreigners allowed to remain in the Soviet Union, together
with his salary, gave Oswald an income which he said approximated
that of the director of the factory in which he worked.<a id="FNanchor_C7-194" href="#Footnote_C7-194" class="fnanchor">C7-194</a></p>

<p>Even though he received more money and better living quarters
than other Russians doing similar work, he envied his wife’s uncle, a
colonel in the MVD, because of the larger apartment in which he
lived. Reminiscent of his attitude toward his superiors in the Marine
Corps, Oswald apparently resented the exercise of authority over him
and the better treatment afforded to Communist Party officials.<a id="FNanchor_C7-195" href="#Footnote_C7-195" class="fnanchor">C7-195</a>
After he returned to the United States he took the position that the
Communist Party officials in the Soviet Union were opportunists who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
were betraying their positions for personal gain. He is reported to
have expressed the conclusion that they had “fat stinking politicians
over there just like we have over here.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-196" href="#Footnote_C7-196" class="fnanchor">C7-196</a></p>

<p>Oswald apparently continued to have personal difficulties while
he was in Minsk. Although Marina Oswald told the Commission that
her husband had good personal relationships in the Soviet Union,<a id="FNanchor_C7-197" href="#Footnote_C7-197" class="fnanchor">C7-197</a>
Katherine Ford, one of the members of the Russian community in
Dallas with which the Oswalds became acquainted upon their arrival
in the United States, stated that Mrs. Oswald told her everybody in
Russia “hated him.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-198" href="#Footnote_C7-198" class="fnanchor">C7-198</a> Jeanne De Mohrenschildt, another member
of that group, said that Oswald told her that he had returned because
“I didn’t find what I was looking for.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-199" href="#Footnote_C7-199" class="fnanchor">C7-199</a> George De Mohrenschildt
thought that Oswald must have become disgusted with life in the
Soviet Union as the novelty of the presence of an American wore off
and he began to be less the center of attention.<a id="FNanchor_C7-200" href="#Footnote_C7-200" class="fnanchor">C7-200</a></p>

<p>The best description of Oswald’s state of mind, however, is set
forth in his own “Historic Diary.” Under the entry for May 1, 1960,
he noted that one of his acquaintances “relats many things I do
not know about the U.S.S.R. I begin to feel uneasy inside, its
true!”<a id="FNanchor_C7-201" href="#Footnote_C7-201" class="fnanchor">C7-201</a> Under the entry for August-September of that year he
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As my Russian improves I become increasingly concious of
just what sort of a sociaty I live in. Mass gymnastics, complusory
afterwork meeting, usually political information meeting. Complusory
attendence at lectures and the sending of the entire shop
collective (except me) to pick potatoes on a Sunday, at a state collective
farm: A “patroict duty” to bring in the harvest. The
opions of the workers (unvoiced) are that its a great pain in the
neck: they don’t seem to be esspicialy enthusiastic about any of the
“collective” duties a natural feeling. I am increasingly aware of
the presence, in all thing, of Lebizen, shop party secretary, fat,
fortyish, and jovial on the outside. He is a no-nonsense party
regular.<a id="FNanchor_C7-202" href="#Footnote_C7-202" class="fnanchor">C7-202</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Finally, the entry of January 4-31 of 1961:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am stating to reconsider my disire about staying the work is
drab the money I get has nowhere to be spent. No night clubs or
bowling allys no places of recreation acept the trade union dances
I have have had enough.<a id="FNanchor_C7-203" href="#Footnote_C7-203" class="fnanchor">C7-203</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Shortly thereafter, less than 18 months after his defection, about
6 weeks before he met Marina Prusakova, Oswald opened negotiations
with the U.S. Embassy in Moscow looking toward his return to the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_C7-204" href="#Footnote_C7-204" class="fnanchor">C7-204</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr145">Return to the United States</h3>

<p>In view of the intensity of his earlier commitment to the Soviet
Union, a great change must have occurred in Oswald’s thinking to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
induce him to return to the United States. The psychological effects
of that change must have been highly unsettling. It should be
remembered that he was not yet 20 years old when he went to the
Soviet Union with such high hopes and not quite 23 when he returned
bitterly disappointed. His attempt to renounce his citizenship had
been an open expression of hostility against the United States and
a profound rejection of his early life. The dramatic break with society
in America now had to be undone. His return to the United States
publicly testified to the utter failure of what had been the most important
act of his life.</p>

<p>Marina Oswald confirmed the fact that her husband was experiencing
psychological difficulties at the time of his return. She said that
“immediately after coming to the United States Lee changed. I did
not know him as such a man in Russia.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-205" href="#Footnote_C7-205" class="fnanchor">C7-205</a> She added that while he
helped her as he had done before, he became more of a recluse, that
“[he] was very irritable, sometimes for a trifle” and that “Lee was very
unrestrained and very explosive” during the period from November
19, 1962 to March of 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C7-206" href="#Footnote_C7-206" class="fnanchor">C7-206</a></p>

<p>After the assassination she wrote that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In general, our family life began to deteriorate after we arrived
in America. Lee was always hot-tempered, and now this
trait of character more and more prevented us from living together
in harmony. Lee became very irritable, and sometimes
some completely trivial thing would drive him into a rage. I
myself do not have a particularly quiet disposition, but I had to
change my character a great deal in order to maintain a more or
less peaceful family life.<a id="FNanchor_C7-207" href="#Footnote_C7-207" class="fnanchor">C7-207</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Marina Oswald’s judgment of her husband’s state of mind may
be substantiated by comparing material which he wrote in the Soviet
Union with what he wrote while on the way back to the United States
and after his return. While in the Soviet Union he wrote his longest
and clearest piece of work, “The Collective.” This was a fairly
coherent description of life in that country, basically centered around
the radio and television factory in which he worked.<a id="FNanchor_C7-208" href="#Footnote_C7-208" class="fnanchor">C7-208</a> While it was
apparently intended for publication in the United States, and is in
many respects critical of certain aspects of life in the Soviet Union, it
appears to be the work of a fairly well organized person. Oswald
prefaced his manuscript with a short autobiographical sketch which
reads in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lee Harvey Oswald was born in Oct 1939 in New Orleans La.
the son of a Insuraen Salesmen whose early death left a far
mean streak of indepence brought on by negleck. entering the
US Marine corp at 17 this streak of independence was strengthed
by exotic journeys to Japan the Philipines and the scores of
odd Islands in the Pacific immianly after serving out his 3 years
in the USMC he abonded his american life to seek a new life in
the USSR. full of optimism and hope he stood in red square
in the fall of 1959 vowing to see his chosen course through, after,
however, two years and alot of growing up I decided to return
to the USA. * * *<a id="FNanchor_C7-209" href="#Footnote_C7-209" class="fnanchor">C7-209</a></p></blockquote>

“The Collective” contrasts sharply with material which Oswald
seems to have written after he left the Soviet Union,<a id="FNanchor_C7-210" href="#Footnote_C7-210" class="fnanchor">C7-210</a> which appears
to be more an expression of his own psychological condition than of
a reasoned analysis. The latter material expresses great hostility to
both communism and capitalism. He wrote, that to a person knowing
both of those systems, “their can be no mediation between those
systems as they exist to-day and that person. He must be opposed to
their basic foundations and representatives”<a id="FNanchor_C7-211" href="#Footnote_C7-211" class="fnanchor">C7-211</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">and yet it is imature to take the sort of attitude which says

<p class="in0">Such an alternative was to be opposed both to capitalism and communism
because:</p>

<blockquote>

brands of slavery.<a id="FNanchor_C7-213" href="#Footnote_C7-213" class="fnanchor">C7-213</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Oswald actually did attempt to formulate such an alternative<a id="FNanchor_C7-214" href="#Footnote_C7-214" class="fnanchor">C7-214</a>
which he planned to “put forward” himself.<a id="FNanchor_C7-215" href="#Footnote_C7-215" class="fnanchor">C7-215</a> He thought the new
alternative would have its best chance to be accepted after “conflict

or foundation of goverment,”<a id="FNanchor_C7-216" href="#Footnote_C7-216" class="fnanchor">C7-216</a> after which the survivors would

misery.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-217" href="#Footnote_C7-217" class="fnanchor">C7-217</a> Oswald realized that “their thinking and education will
be steeped in the traiditions of those systems [and] they would never
except a ‘new order’ complete beyond their understanding.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-218" href="#Footnote_C7-218" class="fnanchor">C7-218</a> As a
result he thought it would be “neccary to oppose the old systems but
at the same time support their cherised trations.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-219" href="#Footnote_C7-219" class="fnanchor">C7-219</a></p>

<p>Expanding on his ideas on how his alternative to communism and
capitalism might be introduced, he wrote of a “readily foreseeable * * *
economic, political or military crisis, internal or external, [which]
will bring about the final destrution of the capitalist system,”<a id="FNanchor_C7-220" href="#Footnote_C7-220" class="fnanchor">C7-220</a> and
indicated that “preparation in a special party could safeguard an independant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
course of action after the debacle,”<a id="FNanchor_C7-221" href="#Footnote_C7-221" class="fnanchor">C7-221</a> which would achieve
the goal, which was:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The emplacement of a separate, democratic, pure communist
sociaty * * * but one with union-communes, democratic socializing
of production and without regard to the twisting apart of <span class="strike">Marxism</span>
Marxist Communism by other powers.<a id="FNanchor_C7-222" href="#Footnote_C7-222" class="fnanchor">C7-222</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">While “[r]esoufualniss and patient working towards the aforesaid
goal’s are prefered rather than loud and useless manifestation’s of
protest,”<a id="FNanchor_C7-223" href="#Footnote_C7-223" class="fnanchor">C7-223</a> Oswald went on to note:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But these prefered tactics now, may prove to be too limited in
the near future, they should not be confused with slowness, indesision
or fear, only the intellectualy fearless could even be remotly
attracted too our doctrine, and yet this doctrine requirers
the <span class="strike">uptmost</span> utmost restraint, a state of being in itself majustic in
power.<a id="FNanchor_C7-224" href="#Footnote_C7-224" class="fnanchor">C7-224</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Oswald’s decided rejection of both capitalism and communism
seemed to place him in a situation in which he could not live with
satisfaction either in the United States or in the Soviet Union. The
discussion above has already set forth examples of his expression of
hatred for the United States. He also expressed hatred of the Soviet
Union and of the Communist Party, U.S.A., even though he later
referred to the latter as “trusted long time fighters for progress.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-225" href="#Footnote_C7-225" class="fnanchor">C7-225</a>
He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Communist Party of the United States has betrayed itself!</p>

<p>it has turned itself into the tradional lever of a foreign power
to overthrow the goverment of the United States; not in the name
of freedow or high ideals, but in servile conformity to the wishes
of the Soviet Union and in anticipation of Soviet Russia’s complete
domination of the American continent.<a id="FNanchor_C7-226" href="#Footnote_C7-226" class="fnanchor">C7-226</a></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There can be no sympathy for those who have turned the idea
of communism into a vill curse to western man.</p>

<p>The Soviets have committed crimes unsurpassed even by their
early day capitalist counterparts, the imprisonment of their own
peoples, with the mass extermination so typical of Stalin, and
the individual surpresstion and regimentation under Krushchev.</p>

<p>The deportations, the purposefull curtailment of diet in the
consumer slighted population of Russia, the murder of history,
the prositution of art and culture.<a id="FNanchor_C7-227" href="#Footnote_C7-227" class="fnanchor">C7-227</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A suggestion that Oswald hated more than just capitalism and
communism is provided by the following, which was apparently written
either on the ship coming back, or after his return from the Soviet
Union:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have offen wondered why it is that the communist, <span class="strike">anarchist</span>
capitatist and even the fasist and anarchist elements in american,
allways profess patrotistism toward the land and the people, if not
the goverment; although their <span class="strike">ideals</span> movements must surly lead
to the bitter destruction of all and everything.</p>

<p>I am quite sure these people must hate not only the goverment
but <span class="strike">our</span> the <span class="strike">peop</span> culture, <span class="strike">traditions,</span> heritage and very people
itself, and yet they stand up and piously pronouce themselfs
patriots, displaying their war medles, that they gained in conflicts
<span class="strike">long-past</span> between themselfs.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I wonder what would happen it somebody was to stand up
and say he was utterly opposed not only to the goverments, but
to the people, too the entire land and complete foundations of
his socically.<a id="FNanchor_C7-228" href="#Footnote_C7-228" class="fnanchor">C7-228</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Oswald demonstrated his thinking in connection with his return
to the United States by preparing two sets of identical questions of
the type which he might have thought he would be asked at a press
conference when he returned. With either great ambivalence or
cold calculation he prepared completely different answers to the same
questions. Judged by his other statements and writings, however, he
appears to have indicated his true feelings in the set of answers first
presented and to have stated in the second what he thought would
be least harmful to him as he resumed life in the United States. For
example, in response to his questions about his decision to go to the
Soviet Union, his first draft answered “as a mark of dicuss and protest
against american political policies in foriengn countrys, my personal
sign of discontent and horror at the misguided line of resoning
of the U.S. Goverment.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-229" href="#Footnote_C7-229" class="fnanchor">C7-229</a> His second answer was that he “went
as a citizen of the U.S. (as a tourist) residing in a forieng conutry
which I have a perfect right to do. I went there to see the land, the
people and how their system works.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-230" href="#Footnote_C7-230" class="fnanchor">C7-230</a></p>

<p>To the question of “Are you a communits?” he first answered “Yes,
basically, allthough I hate the USSR and socialist system I still <em>think</em>
marxism can work under different circumstances.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-231" href="#Footnote_C7-231" class="fnanchor">C7-231</a> His second
answer to this question was, “No of course not, I have never even
know a communist, outside of the ones in the USSR but you can’t
help that.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-232" href="#Footnote_C7-232" class="fnanchor">C7-232</a> His first set of questions and answers indicated his
belief that there were no outstanding differences between the Soviet
Union and the United States, “except in the US. the living standard
is a little higher, freedoms are about the same, medical aid and
the educational system in the USSR is better than in the USA.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-233" href="#Footnote_C7-233" class="fnanchor">C7-233</a>
In the second simulated transcript which ended with the statement
“Newspapers, thank you sir; you are a <em>real</em> patriot!!” he apparently
concluded that the United States offered “freedom of speech travel
outspoken opposition to unpopular policies freedom to believe in god,”
while the Soviet Union did not.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span><a id="FNanchor_C7-234" href="#Footnote_C7-234" class="fnanchor">C7-234</a></p>

<p>Despite the hatred that Oswald expressed toward the Soviet Union
after his residence there, he continued to be interested in that country
after he returned to the United States. Soon after his arrival he
wrote to the Soviet Embassy in Washington requesting information
on how to subscribe to Russian newspapers and magazines and asked
for “any periodicals or bulletins which you may put out for the beneifit
of your citizens living, for a time, in the U.S.A..”<a id="FNanchor_C7-235" href="#Footnote_C7-235" class="fnanchor">C7-235</a> Oswald subsequently
did subscribe to several Soviet journals.<a id="FNanchor_C7-236" href="#Footnote_C7-236" class="fnanchor">C7-236</a> While Marina
Oswald tried to obtain permission to return to the Soviet Union she
testified that she did so at her husband’s insistence.<a id="FNanchor_C7-237" href="#Footnote_C7-237" class="fnanchor">C7-237</a></p>

<p>In July of 1963, Oswald also requested the Soviet Union to provide
a visa for his return to that country.<a id="FNanchor_C7-238" href="#Footnote_C7-238" class="fnanchor">C7-238</a> In August of 1963, he gave the
New Orleans police as a reason for refusing to permit his family to
learn English, that “he hated America and he did not want them to
become ‘Americanized’ and that his plans were to go back to Russia.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-239" href="#Footnote_C7-239" class="fnanchor">C7-239</a>
Even though his primary purpose probably was to get to
Cuba, he sought an immediate grant of visa on his trip to Mexico City
in late September of 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C7-240" href="#Footnote_C7-240" class="fnanchor">C7-240</a> He also inquired about visas for himself
and his wife in a letter which he wrote to the Soviet Embassy in
Washington on November 9, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C7-241" href="#Footnote_C7-241" class="fnanchor">C7-241</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr146">Personal Relations</h3>

<p>Apart from his relatives, Oswald had no friends or close associates
in Texas when he returned there in June of 1962, and he did not
establish any close friendships or associations, although it appears
that he came to respect George De Mohrenschildt.<a id="FNanchor_C7-242" href="#Footnote_C7-242" class="fnanchor">C7-242</a> Somewhat of a
nonconformist,<a id="FNanchor_C7-243" href="#Footnote_C7-243" class="fnanchor">C7-243</a> De Mohrenschildt was a peripheral member of the
so-called Russian community, with which Oswald made contact
through Mr. Peter Gregory, a Russian-speaking petroleum engineer
whom Oswald met as a result of his contact with the Texas Employment
Commission office in Fort Worth.<a id="FNanchor_C7-244" href="#Footnote_C7-244" class="fnanchor">C7-244</a> Some of the members of
that group saw a good deal of the Oswalds through the fall of 1963,
and attempted to help Mrs. Oswald particularly, in various ways.<a id="FNanchor_C7-245" href="#Footnote_C7-245" class="fnanchor">C7-245</a>
In general, Oswald did not like the members of the Russian community.<a id="FNanchor_C7-246" href="#Footnote_C7-246" class="fnanchor">C7-246</a>
In fact, his relations with some of them, particularly George
Bouhe, became quite hostile.<a id="FNanchor_C7-247" href="#Footnote_C7-247" class="fnanchor">C7-247</a> Part of the problem resulted from the
fact that, as Jeanne De Mohrenschildt testified, Oswald was “very,
very disagreeable and disappointed.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-248" href="#Footnote_C7-248" class="fnanchor">C7-248</a> He also expressed considerable
resentment at the help given to his wife by her Russian-American
friends. Jeanne De Mohrenschildt said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Marina had a hundred dresses given to her * * * [and] he
objected to that lavish help, because Marina was throwing it into
his face.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>He was offensive with the people. And I can understand why, * * * because
that hurt him. He could never give her what the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
people were showering on her. * * * no matter how hard he
worked—and he worked very hard.<a id="FNanchor_C7-249" href="#Footnote_C7-249" class="fnanchor">C7-249</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The relations between Oswald and his wife became such that Bouhe
wanted to “liberate” her from Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C7-250" href="#Footnote_C7-250" class="fnanchor">C7-250</a> While the exact sequence
of events is not clear because of conflicting testimony, it appears that
De Mohrenschildt and his wife actually went to Oswald’s apartment
early in November of 1962 and helped to move the personal effects of
Marina Oswald and the baby. Even though it appears that they may
have left Oswald a few days before, it seems that he resisted the move
as best he could. He even threatened to tear up his wife’s dresses and
break all the baby things. According to De Mohrenschildt, Oswald
submitted to the inevitable, presumably because he was “small, you
know, and he was rather a puny individual.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-251" href="#Footnote_C7-251" class="fnanchor">C7-251</a> De Mohrenschildt
said that the whole affair made him nervous since he was “interfering
in other people’s affairs, after all.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-252" href="#Footnote_C7-252" class="fnanchor">C7-252</a></p>

<p>Oswald attempted to get his wife to come back and, over Bouhe’s
protest, De Mohrenschildt finally told him where she was. De Mohrenschildt
admitted that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">if somebody did that to me, a lousy trick like that, to take my wife
away, and all the furniture, I would be mad as hell, too. I am
surprised that he didn’t do something worse.<a id="FNanchor_C7-253" href="#Footnote_C7-253" class="fnanchor">C7-253</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">After about a 2-week separation, Marina Oswald returned to her
husband.<a id="FNanchor_C7-254" href="#Footnote_C7-254" class="fnanchor">C7-254</a> Bouhe thoroughly disapproved of this and as a result
almost all communication between the Oswalds and members of the
Russian community ceased. Contacts with De Mohrenschildt and
his wife did continue and they saw the Oswalds occasionally until
the spring of 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C7-255" href="#Footnote_C7-255" class="fnanchor">C7-255</a></p>

<p>Shortly after his return from the Soviet Union, Oswald severed
all relations with his mother; he did not see his brother Robert from
Thanksgiving of 1962 until November 23, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C7-256" href="#Footnote_C7-256" class="fnanchor">C7-256</a> At the time of his
defection, Oswald had said that neither his brother, Robert, nor his
mother were objects of his affection, “but only examples of workers in
the U.S.” He also indicated to officials at the American Embassy in
Moscow that his defection was motivated at least in part by so-called
exploitation of his mother by the capitalist system.<a id="FNanchor_C7-257" href="#Footnote_C7-257" class="fnanchor">C7-257</a> Consistent with
this attitude he first told his wife that he did not have a mother, but
later admitted that he did but that “he didn’t love her very much.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-258" href="#Footnote_C7-258" class="fnanchor">C7-258</a></p>

<p>When they arrived from the Soviet Union, Oswald and his family
lived at first with his brother Robert. The latter testified that
they “were just together again,” as if his brother “had not been to
Russia.” He also said that he and his family got along well with
Marina Oswald and enjoyed showing her American things.<a id="FNanchor_C7-259" href="#Footnote_C7-259" class="fnanchor">C7-259</a> After
about a month with his brother, Oswald and his family lived for a
brief period with his mother at her urging, but Oswald soon decided
to move out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span><a id="FNanchor_C7-260" href="#Footnote_C7-260" class="fnanchor">C7-260</a></p>

<p>Marguerite Oswald visited her son and his family at the first apartment
which he rented after his return, and tried to help them get
settled there. After she had bought some clothes for Marina Oswald
and a highchair for the baby, Oswald emphatically told her to stop.
As Marguerite Oswald testified, “he strongly put me in my place about
buying things for his wife that he himself could not buy.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-261" href="#Footnote_C7-261" class="fnanchor">C7-261</a> Oswald
objected to his mother visiting the apartment and became quite incensed
with his wife when she would open the door for her in spite of
his instructions to the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_C7-262" href="#Footnote_C7-262" class="fnanchor">C7-262</a> Oswald moved to Dallas on about
October 8, 1962, without telling his mother where he was going.
He never saw or communicated with her in any way again until
she came to see him after the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C7-263" href="#Footnote_C7-263" class="fnanchor">C7-263</a></p>

<p>Even though Oswald cut off relations with his mother, he attempted
for the first time to learn something about his family background
when he went to New Orleans in April of 1963. He visited some of
his father’s elderly relatives and the cemetery where his father was
buried in an effort to develop the facts of his genealogy.<a id="FNanchor_C7-264" href="#Footnote_C7-264" class="fnanchor">C7-264</a> While
it does not appear that he established any new relationships as a result
of his investigation, he did obtain a large picture of his father
from one of the elderly relatives with whom he spoke.<a id="FNanchor_C7-265" href="#Footnote_C7-265" class="fnanchor">C7-265</a> Oswald’s
interest in such things presents a sharp contrast with his attitude at
the time of his defection, when he evidenced no interest in his father
and hardly mentioned him, even when questioned.<a id="FNanchor_C7-266" href="#Footnote_C7-266" class="fnanchor">C7-266</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr147">Employment</h3>

<p>Oswald’s defection, his interest in the Soviet Union, and his activities
on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee not only caused him
difficulties in his employment relations, but they also provided him
with excuses for employment failures which were largely of his own
making. Oswald experienced some difficulty finding employment.
Perhaps this was partially because of his lack of any specific skill or
training.<a id="FNanchor_C7-267" href="#Footnote_C7-267" class="fnanchor">C7-267</a> Some of his acquaintances, feeling that Oswald tried
to impress people with the fact that he had lived and worked in Russia,
were led to the belief that his employment difficulties were caused
by his telling prospective employers that he had last been employed in
Minsk.<a id="FNanchor_C7-268" href="#Footnote_C7-268" class="fnanchor">C7-268</a> While he might have expected difficulty from such an approach,
in fact the evidence indicates that Oswald usually told his
prospective employers and employment counselors that he had recently
been discharged from the Marine Corps.<a id="FNanchor_C7-269" href="#Footnote_C7-269" class="fnanchor">C7-269</a></p>

<p>Oswald obtained a job in July of 1962 as a sheet metal worker with
a company in Fort Worth. His performance for that company was
satisfactory.<a id="FNanchor_C7-270" href="#Footnote_C7-270" class="fnanchor">C7-270</a> Even though he told his wife that he had been fired,
he voluntarily left on October 8, 1962, and moved to Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C7-271" href="#Footnote_C7-271" class="fnanchor">C7-271</a></p>

<p>On October 9, 1962 he went to the Dallas office of the Texas Employment
Commission where he expressed a reluctance to work in the industrial
field.<a id="FNanchor_C7-272" href="#Footnote_C7-272" class="fnanchor">C7-272</a> He indicated an interest in writing. An employment
counselor testified, on the basis of a general aptitude test Oswald had
taken, that he had some aptitude in that area, “because the verbal score<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
is high and the clerical score is high.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-273" href="#Footnote_C7-273" class="fnanchor">C7-273</a> While that counselor
found that he was qualified to handle many different types of jobs,
because of his need for immediate employment she attempted to obtain
for him any job that was available at the time. Oswald made
qualifying marks in 19 of 23 categories included on the general aptitude
examination and scored 127 on the verbal test, as compared with
50 percent of the people taking it who score less than 100. The counselor
testified that there was some indication that Oswald was capable
of doing college work and noted that Oswald’s verbal and clerical
potential was “outstanding.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-274" href="#Footnote_C7-274" class="fnanchor">C7-274</a> Employment Commission records
concerning Oswald stated: “Well-groomed &amp; spoken, business suit,
alert replies—Expresses self extremely well.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-275" href="#Footnote_C7-275" class="fnanchor">C7-275</a> Oswald said that
he hoped eventually to develop qualifications for employment as a
junior executive through a work-study program at a local college.
He indicated, however, that he would have to delay that program
because of his immediate financial needs and responsibilities.<a id="FNanchor_C7-276" href="#Footnote_C7-276" class="fnanchor">C7-276</a></p>

<p>On October 11, 1962, the Employment Commission referred Oswald
to a commercial advertising photography firm in Dallas,<a id="FNanchor_C7-277" href="#Footnote_C7-277" class="fnanchor">C7-277</a> where
he was employed as a trainee starting October 12, 1962.<a id="FNanchor_C7-278" href="#Footnote_C7-278" class="fnanchor">C7-278</a> Even
though Oswald indicated that he liked photographic work,<a id="FNanchor_C7-279" href="#Footnote_C7-279" class="fnanchor">C7-279</a> his employer
found that he was not an efficient worker. He was not able to
produce photographic work which adhered with sufficient precision to
the job specifications and as a result too much of his work had to be
redone.<a id="FNanchor_C7-280" href="#Footnote_C7-280" class="fnanchor">C7-280</a> He also had difficulty in working with the other employees.
This was at least in part because of the close physical confines
in which some of the work had to be done.<a id="FNanchor_C7-281" href="#Footnote_C7-281" class="fnanchor">C7-281</a> He did not seem to be
able to make the accommodations necessary when people work under
such conditions and as a result became involved in conflicts, some
of which were fairly heated, with his fellow employees.<a id="FNanchor_C7-282" href="#Footnote_C7-282" class="fnanchor">C7-282</a></p>

<p>In February or March of 1963, it began to appear that Oswald was
having considerable difficulty doing accurate work and in getting
along with the other employees. It appears that his discharge was
hastened by the fact that he brought a Russian language newspaper
to work.<a id="FNanchor_C7-283" href="#Footnote_C7-283" class="fnanchor">C7-283</a> It is not possible to tell whether Oswald did this to provide
an excuse for his eventual discharge, or whether he brought the
Russian language newspaper with him one day after his other difficulties
became clear. It is possible that his immediate supervisor
noticed the newspaper at that time because his attention had otherwise
been drawn more directly to Oswald. In any event, Oswald
was discharged on April 6, 1963, ostensibly because of his inefficiency
and difficult personality. His supervisor admitted, however, that
while he did not fire Oswald because of the newspaper incident or
even weigh it heavily in his decision, “it didn’t do his case any
good.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-284" href="#Footnote_C7-284" class="fnanchor">C7-284</a></p>

<p>Upon moving to New Orleans on April 24, 1963, Oswald’s employment
problems became more difficult. He left his wife and child at
the home of a friend, Mrs. Ruth Paine, of Irving, Tex.<a id="FNanchor_C7-285" href="#Footnote_C7-285" class="fnanchor">C7-285</a> In New
Orleans he obtained work as a greaser and oiler of coffee processing
machines for the William B. Reily Co., beginning May 10, 1963.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span><a id="FNanchor_C7-286" href="#Footnote_C7-286" class="fnanchor">C7-286</a>
After securing this job and an apartment, Oswald asked his wife to
join him. Mrs. Paine brought Oswald’s family to New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_C7-287" href="#Footnote_C7-287" class="fnanchor">C7-287</a>
Refusing to admit that he could only get work as a greaser, Oswald
told his wife and Mrs. Paine that he was working as a commercial
photographer.<a id="FNanchor_C7-288" href="#Footnote_C7-288" class="fnanchor">C7-288</a> He lost his job on July 19, 1963, because his work
was not satisfactory<a id="FNanchor_C7-289" href="#Footnote_C7-289" class="fnanchor">C7-289</a> and because he spent too much time loitering
in the garage next door, where he read rifle and hunting magazines.<a id="FNanchor_C7-290" href="#Footnote_C7-290" class="fnanchor">C7-290</a>
Oswald apparently concluded that his Fair Play for Cuba Committee
activities were not related to his discharge.<a id="FNanchor_C7-291" href="#Footnote_C7-291" class="fnanchor">C7-291</a> The correctness
of that conclusion is supported by the fact that he does not
seem to have been publicly identified with that organization until
August 9, 1963, almost a month after he lost his job.<a id="FNanchor_C7-292" href="#Footnote_C7-292" class="fnanchor">C7-292</a></p>

<p>His Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities, however, made it
more difficult for him to obtain other employment. A placement
interviewer of the Louisiana Department of Labor who had previously
interviewed Oswald, saw him on television and heard a radio debate
in which he engaged on August 21, 1963. He consulted with his
supervisor and “it was determined that we should not undertake to
furnish employment references for him.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-293" href="#Footnote_C7-293" class="fnanchor">C7-293</a> Ironically, he failed to
get a job in another photographic firm after his return to Dallas in
October of 1963, because the president of the photographic firm for
which he had previously worked told the prospective employer that
Oswald was “kinda peculiar sometimes and that he had some knowledge
of the Russian language,” and that he “may be a damn Communist.
I can’t tell you. If I was you, I wouldn’t hire him.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-294" href="#Footnote_C7-294" class="fnanchor">C7-294</a> The
plant superintendent of the new firm testified that one of the employees
of the old firm “implied that Oswald’s fellow employees did not like
him because he was propagandizing and had been seen reading a
foreign newspaper.” As a result Oswald was not hired.<a id="FNanchor_C7-295" href="#Footnote_C7-295" class="fnanchor">C7-295</a> He subsequently
found a job with the Texas School Book Depository for which
he performed his duties satisfactorily.<a id="FNanchor_C7-296" href="#Footnote_C7-296" class="fnanchor">C7-296</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr148">Attack on General Walker</h3>

<p>The Commission has concluded that on April 10, 1963, Oswald
shot at Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker (Resigned, U.S. Army),
demonstrating once again his propensity to act dramatically and, in
this instance violently, in furtherance of his beliefs. The shooting
occurred 2 weeks before Oswald moved to New Orleans and a few
days after he had been discharged by the photographic firm. As indicated
in chapter IV, Oswald had been planning his attack on
General Walker for at least 1<a id="FNanchor_C7-297" href="#Footnote_C7-297" class="fnanchor">C7-297</a> and perhaps as much as 2
months.<a id="FNanchor_C7-298" href="#Footnote_C7-298" class="fnanchor">C7-298</a> He outlined his plans in a notebook and studied them at
considerable length before his attack.<a id="FNanchor_C7-299" href="#Footnote_C7-299" class="fnanchor">C7-299</a> He also studied Dallas bus
schedules to prepare for his later use of buses to travel to and from
General Walker’s house.<a id="FNanchor_C7-300" href="#Footnote_C7-300" class="fnanchor">C7-300</a> Sometime after March 27, but according
to Marina Oswald, prior to April 10, 1963,<a id="FNanchor_C7-301" href="#Footnote_C7-301" class="fnanchor">C7-301</a> Oswald posed for two
pictures with his recently acquired rifle and pistol, a copy of the March
24, 1963, issue of the Worker, and the March 11, 1963, issue of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
Militant.<a id="FNanchor_C7-302" href="#Footnote_C7-302" class="fnanchor">C7-302</a> He told his wife that he wanted to send the pictures to
the Militant and he also asked her to keep one of the pictures for his
daughter, June.<a id="FNanchor_C7-303" href="#Footnote_C7-303" class="fnanchor">C7-303</a></p>

<p>Following his unsuccessful attack on Walker, Oswald returned
home. He had left a note for his wife telling her what to do in case he
were apprehended, as well as his notebook and the pictures of himself
holding the rifle.<a id="FNanchor_C7-304" href="#Footnote_C7-304" class="fnanchor">C7-304</a> She testified that she was agitated because she
had found the note in Oswald’s room, where she had gone, contrary
to his instructions, after she became worried about his absence.<a id="FNanchor_C7-305" href="#Footnote_C7-305" class="fnanchor">C7-305</a> She
indicated that she had no advance knowledge of Oswald’s plans, that
she became quite angry when Oswald told her what he had done, and
that she made him promise never to repeat such a performance. She
said that she kept the note to use against him “if something like that
should be repeated again.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-306" href="#Footnote_C7-306" class="fnanchor">C7-306</a> When asked if Oswald requested the
note back she testified that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He forgot about it. But apparently after he thought that what he
had written in his book might be proof against him, and he
destroyed it. [the book]<a id="FNanchor_C7-307" href="#Footnote_C7-307" class="fnanchor">C7-307</a></p></blockquote>

<p>She later gave the following testimony [*indicates that the witness
answered without using the interpreter]:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Q. After he brought the rifle home, then, he showed you the
book?</p>

<p>*A. Yes.</p>

<p>Q. And you said it was not a good idea to keep this book?</p>

<p>*A. Yes.</p>

<p>Q. And then he burned the book?</p>

<p>*A. Yes.</p>

<p>Q. Did you ask him why he had not destroyed the book before
he actually went to shoot General Walker?</p>

<p>A. It never came to me, myself, to ask him that question.<a id="FNanchor_C7-308" href="#Footnote_C7-308" class="fnanchor">C7-308</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Marina Oswald’s testimony indicates that her husband was not
particularly concerned about his continued possession of the most
incriminating sort of evidence.<a id="FNanchor_C7-309" href="#Footnote_C7-309" class="fnanchor">C7-309</a> If he had been successful and had
been apprehended even for routine questioning, his apartment would
undoubtedly have been searched, and his role would have been made
clear by the evidence which he had left behind. Leaving the note
and picture as he did would seem to indicate that he had considered
the possibility of capture. Possibly he might have wanted to be
caught, and wanted his involvement made clear if he was in fact
apprehended. Even after his wife told him to destroy the notebook
he removed at least some of the pictures which had been pasted in it
and saved them among his effects, where they were found after the
assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C7-310" href="#Footnote_C7-310" class="fnanchor">C7-310</a> His behavior was entirely consistent with his wife’s
testimony that:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I asked him what for he was making all these entries in the
book and he answered that he wanted to leave a complete record
so that all the details would be in it.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I am guessing that perhaps he did it to appear to be a brave
man in case he were arrested, but that is my supposition * * *<a id="FNanchor_C7-311" href="#Footnote_C7-311" class="fnanchor">C7-311</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The attempt on General Walker’s life deserves close attention in any
consideration of Oswald’s possible motive for the assassination and the
trail of evidence he left behind him on that occasion. While there are
differences between the two events as far as Oswald’s actions and planning
are concerned, there are also similarities that should be considered.
The items which Oswald left at home when he made his attack on
Walker suggest a strong concern for his place in history. If the attack
had succeeded and Oswald had been caught, the pictures showing
him with his rifle and his Communist and Socialist Worker’s Party
newspapers would probably have appeared on the front pages of newspapers
or magazines all over the country, as, in fact, one of them did
appear after the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C7-312" href="#Footnote_C7-312" class="fnanchor">C7-312</a> The circumstances of the attack on
Walker coupled with other indications that Oswald was concerned
about his place in history<a id="FNanchor_C7-313" href="#Footnote_C7-313" class="fnanchor">C7-313</a> and with the circumstances surrounding
the assassination, have led the Commission to believe that such concern
is an important factor to consider in assessing possible motivation for
the assassination.</p>

<p>In any event, the Walker incident indicates that in spite of the
belief among those who knew him that he was apparently not dangerous,<a id="FNanchor_C7-314" href="#Footnote_C7-314" class="fnanchor">C7-314</a>
Oswald did not lack the determination and other traits required
to carry out a carefully planned killing of another human being
and was willing to consummate such a purpose if he thought there was
sufficient reason to do so. Some idea of what he thought was sufficient
reason for such an act may be found in the nature of the motive that
he stated for his attack on General Walker. Marina Oswald indicated
that her husband had compared General Walker to Adolph
Hitler. She testified that Oswald said that General Walker “was a
very bad man, that he was a fascist, that he was the leader of a fascist
organization, and when I said that even though all of that might be
true, just the same he had no right to take his life, he said if someone
had killed Hitler in time it would have saved many lives.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-315" href="#Footnote_C7-315" class="fnanchor">C7-315</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr149">Political Activities</h3>

<p>Oswald’s political activities after his return to the United States
center around his interest in Cuba and in the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee. Although, as indicated above, the Commission has been
unable to find any credible evidence that he was involved in any conspiracy,
his political activities do provide insight into certain aspects
of Oswald’s character and into his possible motivation for the
assassination. While it appears that he may have distributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
Fair Play for Cuba Committee materials on one uneventful occasion
in Dallas sometime during the period April 6-24, 1963,<a id="FNanchor_C7-316" href="#Footnote_C7-316" class="fnanchor">C7-316</a>
Oswald’s first public identification with that cause was in New Orleans.
There, in late May and early June of 1963, under the name
Lee Osborne, he had printed a handbill headed in large letters “Hands
Off Cuba,” an application form for, and a membership card in, the
New Orleans branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.<a id="FNanchor_C7-317" href="#Footnote_C7-317" class="fnanchor">C7-317</a> He
first distributed his handbills and other material uneventfully in the
vicinity of the U.S.S. <i>Wasp</i>, which was berthed at the Dumaine Street
wharf in New Orleans, on June 16, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C7-318" href="#Footnote_C7-318" class="fnanchor">C7-318</a> He distributed literature
in downtown New Orleans on August 9, 1963, and was arrested because
of a dispute with three anti-Castro Cuban exiles, and again on August
16, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C7-319" href="#Footnote_C7-319" class="fnanchor">C7-319</a> Following his arrest, he was interviewed by the police, and
at his own request, by an agent of the FBI.<a id="FNanchor_C7-320" href="#Footnote_C7-320" class="fnanchor">C7-320</a> On August 17, 1963, he
appeared briefly on a radio program<a id="FNanchor_C7-321" href="#Footnote_C7-321" class="fnanchor">C7-321</a> and on August 21, 1963, he
debated over radio station WDSU, New Orleans, with Carlos Bringuier,
one of the Cuban exiles who had been arrested with him on
August 9.<a id="FNanchor_C7-322" href="#Footnote_C7-322" class="fnanchor">C7-322</a> Bringuier claimed that on August 5, 1963, Oswald had
attempted to infiltrate an anti-Castro organization with which he was
associated.<a id="FNanchor_C7-323" href="#Footnote_C7-323" class="fnanchor">C7-323</a></p>

<p>While Oswald publicly engaged in the activities described above,
his “organization” was a product of his imagination.<a id="FNanchor_C7-324" href="#Footnote_C7-324" class="fnanchor">C7-324</a> The imaginary
president of the nonexistent chapter was named A. J. Hidell,<a id="FNanchor_C7-325" href="#Footnote_C7-325" class="fnanchor">C7-325</a> the
name that Oswald used when he purchased the assassination weapon.<a id="FNanchor_C7-326" href="#Footnote_C7-326" class="fnanchor">C7-326</a>
Marina Oswald said she signed that name, apparently chosen because
it rhymed with “Fidel,”<a id="FNanchor_C7-327" href="#Footnote_C7-327" class="fnanchor">C7-327</a> to her husband’s membership card in the
New Orleans chapter. She testified that he threatened to beat her if
she did not do so.<a id="FNanchor_C7-328" href="#Footnote_C7-328" class="fnanchor">C7-328</a> The chapter had never been chartered by the
national FPCC organization.<a id="FNanchor_C7-329" href="#Footnote_C7-329" class="fnanchor">C7-329</a> It appears to have been a solitary
operation on Oswald’s part in spite of his misstatements to the New
Orleans police that it had 35 members, 5 of which were usually present
at meetings which were held once a month.<a id="FNanchor_C7-330" href="#Footnote_C7-330" class="fnanchor">C7-330</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s Fair Play for Cuba activities may be viewed as a very
shrewd political operation in which one man single handedly created
publicity for his cause or for himself. It is also evidence of Oswald’s
reluctance to describe events accurately and of his need to present
himself to others as well as to himself in a light more favorable than
was justified by reality. This is suggested by his misleading and sometime
untruthful statements in his letters to Mr. V. T. Lee, then
national director of FPCC. In one of those letters, dated August 1,
1963, Oswald wrote that an office which he had previously claimed to
have rented for FPCC activities had been “promply closed 3 days
later for some obsure reasons by the renters, they said something
about remodeling ect., I’m sure you understand.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-331" href="#Footnote_C7-331" class="fnanchor">C7-331</a> He wrote that
“thousands of circulars were distrubed”<a id="FNanchor_C7-332" href="#Footnote_C7-332" class="fnanchor">C7-332</a> and that he continued to
receive inquiries through his post office box which he endeavored
“to keep ansewering to the best of my ability.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-333" href="#Footnote_C7-333" class="fnanchor">C7-333</a> In his letter to
V. T. Lee, he stated that he was then alone in his efforts on behalf
of FPCC, but he attributed his lack of support to an attack by Cuban<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
exiles in a street demonstration and being “officialy cautioned” by the
police, events which “robbed me of what support I had leaving me
alone.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-334" href="#Footnote_C7-334" class="fnanchor">C7-334</a></p>

<p>In spite of those claims, the Commission has not been able to uncover
any evidence that anyone ever attacked any street demonstration
in which Oswald was involved, except for the Bringuier incident mentioned
above, which occurred 8 days after Oswald wrote the above
letter to V. T. Lee.<a id="FNanchor_C7-335" href="#Footnote_C7-335" class="fnanchor">C7-335</a> Bringuier, who seemed to be familiar with many
anti-Castro activities in New Orleans, was not aware of any such
incident.<a id="FNanchor_C7-336" href="#Footnote_C7-336" class="fnanchor">C7-336</a> Police reports also fail to reflect any activity on Oswald’s
part prior to August 9, 1963, except for the uneventful distribution of
literature at the Dumaine Street wharf in June.<a id="FNanchor_C7-337" href="#Footnote_C7-337" class="fnanchor">C7-337</a> Furthermore, the
general tenor of Oswald’s next letter to V. T. Lee, in which he supported
his report on the Bringuier incident with a copy of the charges
made against him and a newspaper clipping reporting the event, suggests
that his previous story of an attack by Cuban exiles was at least
greatly exaggerated.<a id="FNanchor_C7-338" href="#Footnote_C7-338" class="fnanchor">C7-338</a> While the legend “FPCC 544 Camp St. NEW
ORLEANS, LA.” was stamped on some literature that Oswald had
in his possession at the time of his arrest in New Orleans, extensive
investigation was not able to connect Oswald with that address, although
it did develop the fact that an anti-Castro organization had
maintained offices there for a period ending early in 1962.<a id="FNanchor_C7-339" href="#Footnote_C7-339" class="fnanchor">C7-339</a> The
Commission has not been able to find any other indication that Oswald
had rented an office in New Orleans. In view of the limited amount
of public activity on Oswald’s part before August 9, 1963, there also
seems to be no basis for his claim that he had distributed “thousands”
of circulars, especially since he had claimed to have printed only 2,000
and actually had only 1,000 printed. In addition, there is no evidence
that he received any substantial amount of materials from the national
headquarters.<a id="FNanchor_C7-340" href="#Footnote_C7-340" class="fnanchor">C7-340</a></p>

<p>In another letter to V. T. Lee, dated August 17, 1963, Oswald wrote
that he had appeared on Mr. William Stuckey’s 15-minute television
program over WDSU-TV called “Latin American Focus” as a result
of which he was “flooded with callers and invitations to debate’s ect.
as well as people interested in joining the F.P.C.C. New Orleans
branch.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-341" href="#Footnote_C7-341" class="fnanchor">C7-341</a> WDSU has no program of any kind called “Latin American
Focus.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-342" href="#Footnote_C7-342" class="fnanchor">C7-342</a> Stuckey had a radio program called “Latin Listening
Post,” on which Oswald was heard for less than 5 minutes on August
17, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C7-343" href="#Footnote_C7-343" class="fnanchor">C7-343</a> It appears that Oswald had only one caller in response to
all of his FPCC activities, an agent of Bringuier’s attempting to learn
more about the true nature of the alleged FPCC “organization” in
New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_C7-344" href="#Footnote_C7-344" class="fnanchor">C7-344</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s statements suggest that he hoped to be flooded with callers
and invitations to debate. This would have made him a real center of
attention as he must have been when he first arrived in the Soviet Union
and as he was to some extent when he returned to the United States.
The limited notoriety that Oswald received as a result of the street
fracas and in the subsequent radio debate was apparently not enough
to satisfy him. He exaggerated in his letters to V. T. Lee in an apparent
attempt to make himself and his activities appear far more important
than they really were.</p>

His attempt to express himself through his Fair Play for Cuba activities,
however, was greatly impeded by the fact that the radio debate
over WDSU on August 21, 1963, brought out the history of his defection
to the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_C7-345" href="#Footnote_C7-345" class="fnanchor">C7-345</a> The basic facts of the event were uncovered
independently by William Stuckey, who arranged the debate, and
Edward Butler, executive director of the Information Council of the
Americas, who also appeared on the program.<a id="FNanchor_C7-346" href="#Footnote_C7-346" class="fnanchor">C7-346</a> Oswald was confronted
with those facts at the beginning of the debate and was so
thrown on the defensive by this that he was forced to state that Fair
Play for Cuba was “not at all Communist controlled regardless of
the fact that I had the experience of living in Russia.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-347" href="#Footnote_C7-347" class="fnanchor">C7-347</a></p>

<p>Stuckey testified that uncovering Oswald’s defection was very
important:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think that we finished him on that program. * * * because
we had publicly linked the Fair Play for Cuba Committee with a
fellow who had lived in Russia for 3 years and who was an admitted
Marxist.</p>

<p>The interesting thing, or rather the danger involved, was the
fact that Oswald seemed like such a nice, bright boy and was extremely
believable before this. We thought the fellow could
probably get quite a few members if he was really indeed serious
about getting members. We figured after this broadcast of
August 21, why, that was no longer possible.<a id="FNanchor_C7-348" href="#Footnote_C7-348" class="fnanchor">C7-348</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In spite of the fact that Oswald had been surprised and was on the
defensive throughout the debate, according to Stuckey: “Mr. Oswald
handled himself very well, as usual.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-349" href="#Footnote_C7-349" class="fnanchor">C7-349</a> Stuckey thought Oswald
“appeared to be a very logical, intelligent fellow,” and “was arrested
by his cleancutness.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-350" href="#Footnote_C7-350" class="fnanchor">C7-350</a> He did not think Oswald looked like the
“type” that he would have expected to find associating with a group
such as the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.<a id="FNanchor_C7-351" href="#Footnote_C7-351" class="fnanchor">C7-351</a> Stuckey thought that
Oswald acted very much as would a young attorney.<a id="FNanchor_C7-352" href="#Footnote_C7-352" class="fnanchor">C7-352</a></p>

<p>Following the disclosure of his defection, Oswald sought advice
from the Communist Party, U.S.A., concerning his Fair Play for
Cuba activity.<a id="FNanchor_C7-353" href="#Footnote_C7-353" class="fnanchor">C7-353</a> He had previously sent, apparently unsolicited, to
the Party newspaper, the Worker, samples of his photographic work,
offering to contribute that sort of service without charge.<a id="FNanchor_C7-354" href="#Footnote_C7-354" class="fnanchor">C7-354</a> The
Worker replied: “Your kind offer is most welcomed and from time to
time we shall call on you.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-355" href="#Footnote_C7-355" class="fnanchor">C7-355</a> He later wrote to another official of the
Worker, seeking employment, and mentioning the praise he had
received for submitting his photographic work.<a id="FNanchor_C7-356" href="#Footnote_C7-356" class="fnanchor">C7-356</a> He presented
Arnold Johnson, Gus Hall, and Benjamin J. Davis honorary membership
cards in his nonexistent New Orleans chapter of the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee, and advised them of some of his activities
on behalf of the organization.<a id="FNanchor_C7-357" href="#Footnote_C7-357" class="fnanchor">C7-357</a> Arnold Johnson, director of the information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
and lecture bureau of the Communist Party, U.S.A., replied
stating:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is good to know that movements in support of fair play
for Cuba has developed in New Orleans as well as in other cities.
We do not have any organizational ties with the Committee, and
yet there is much material that we issue from time to time that
is important for anybody who is concerned about developments
in Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_C7-358" href="#Footnote_C7-358" class="fnanchor">C7-358</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Marina Oswald said that such correspondence from people he considered
important meant much to Oswald. After he had begun his
Cuban activity in New Orleans “he received a letter from somebody
in New York, some Communist—probably from New York—I am not
sure from where—from some Communist leader and he was very
happy, he felt that this was a great man that he had received the letter
from.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-359" href="#Footnote_C7-359" class="fnanchor">C7-359</a> Since he seemed to feel that no one else understood his political
views, the letter was of great value to him for it “was proof
* * * that there were people who understood his activity.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-360" href="#Footnote_C7-360" class="fnanchor">C7-360</a></p>

<p>He anticipated that the full disclosure of his defection would hinder
him in “the struggle for progress and freedom in the United
States”<a id="FNanchor_C7-361" href="#Footnote_C7-361" class="fnanchor">C7-361</a> into which Oswald, in his own words, had “thrown” himself.
He sought advice from the central committee of the Communist
Party, U.S.A., in a letter dated August 28, 1963, about whether he
could “continue to fight, handicapped as it were, by my past
record * * * [and] compete with anti-progressive forces, above-ground
or weather in your opion I should always remain in the background,
i.e. underground.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-362" href="#Footnote_C7-362" class="fnanchor">C7-362</a> Stating that he had used his “position”
with what he claimed to be the local branch of the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee to “foster communist ideals,” Oswald wrote that
he felt that he might have compromised the FPCC and expressed concern
lest “Our opponents could use my background of residence
in the U.S.S.R. against any cause which I join, by association, they
could say the organization of which I am a member, is Russian controled,
ect.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-363" href="#Footnote_C7-363" class="fnanchor">C7-363</a> In reply Arnold Johnson advised Oswald that, while
as an American citizen he had a right to participate in such organizations
as he wished, “there are a number of organizations, including
possibly Fair Play, which are of a very broad character, and often it
is advisable for some people to remain in the background, not underground.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-364" href="#Footnote_C7-364" class="fnanchor">C7-364</a></p>

<p>By August of 1963, after a short 3 months in New Orleans, the city
in which he had been born and had lived most of his early life, Oswald
had fallen on difficult times. He had not liked his job as a greaser
of coffee processing machinery and he held it for only a little over 2
months.<a id="FNanchor_C7-365" href="#Footnote_C7-365" class="fnanchor">C7-365</a> He had not found another job. His wife was expecting
their second child in October and there was concern about the cost
which would be involved.<a id="FNanchor_C7-366" href="#Footnote_C7-366" class="fnanchor">C7-366</a> His brief foray on behalf of
the Fair Play for Cuba Committee had failed to win any support.
While he had drawn some attention to himself and had actually appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
on two radio programs, he had been attacked by Cuban exiles
and arrested, an event which his wife thought upset him and as a
result of which “he became less active, he cooled off a little.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-367" href="#Footnote_C7-367" class="fnanchor">C7-367</a>
More seriously, the facts of his defection had become known, leaving
him open to almost unanswerable attack by those who opposed his
views. It would not have been possible to have followed Arnold
Johnson’s advice to remain in the background, since there was no
background to the New Orleans FPCC “organization,” which consisted
solely of Oswald. Furthermore, he had apparently not received
any letters from the national headquarters of FPCC since May 29,
1963,<a id="FNanchor_C7-368" href="#Footnote_C7-368" class="fnanchor">C7-368</a> even though he had written four detailed letters since that
time to Mr. V. T. Lee<a id="FNanchor_C7-369" href="#Footnote_C7-369" class="fnanchor">C7-369</a> and had also kept the national headquarters
informed of each of his changes of mailing address.<a id="FNanchor_C7-370" href="#Footnote_C7-370" class="fnanchor">C7-370</a> Those events
no doubt had their effects on Oswald.</p>

<h3 id="hdr150">Interest in Cuba</h3>

<p>By August of 1963, Oswald had for some time been considering
the possibility of leaving the United States again. On June 24, 1963,
he applied for a new passport<a id="FNanchor_C7-371" href="#Footnote_C7-371" class="fnanchor">C7-371</a> and in late June or early July he
told his wife that he wanted to return to the Soviet Union with her.
She said that he was extremely upset, very unhappy, and that he
actually wept when he told her that.<a id="FNanchor_C7-372" href="#Footnote_C7-372" class="fnanchor">C7-372</a> He said that nothing kept
him in the United States, that he would not lose anything if he returned
to the Soviet Union, that he wanted to be with her and that
it would be better to have less and not have to be concerned about
tomorrow.<a id="FNanchor_C7-373" href="#Footnote_C7-373" class="fnanchor">C7-373</a></p>

<p>As a result of that conversation, Marina Oswald wrote the Soviet
Embassy in Washington concerning a request she had first made on
February 17, 1963, for permission for herself and June to return to
the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_C7-374" href="#Footnote_C7-374" class="fnanchor">C7-374</a> While that first request, made according to
Marina Oswald at her husband’s insistence, specifically stated that
Oswald was to remain in the United States, she wrote in her letter of
July 1963, that “things are improving due to the fact that my husband
expresses a sincere wish to return together with me to the USSR.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-375" href="#Footnote_C7-375" class="fnanchor">C7-375</a>
Unknown to his wife, however, Oswald apparently enclosed a note
with her letter of July in which he requested the Embassy to rush
his wife’s entrance visa because of the impending birth of the second
child but stated that: “As for my return entrance visa please consider
it <em>separtably</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-376" href="#Footnote_C7-376" class="fnanchor">C7-376</a></p>

<p>Thus, while Oswald’s real intentions, assuming that they were
known to himself, are not clear, he may not have intended to go to
the Soviet Union directly, if at all.<a id="FNanchor_C7-377" href="#Footnote_C7-377" class="fnanchor">C7-377</a> It appears that he really wanted
to go to Cuba. In his wife’s words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I only know that his basic desire was to get to Cuba by any
means, and that all the rest of it was window dressing for that
purpose.<a id="FNanchor_C7-378" href="#Footnote_C7-378" class="fnanchor">C7-378</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
Marina Oswald testified that her husband engaged in Fair Play for
Cuba Committee activities “primarily for purposes of self-advertising.
He wanted to be arrested. I think he wanted to get into the
newspapers, so that he would be known.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-379" href="#Footnote_C7-379" class="fnanchor">C7-379</a> According to Marina
Oswald, he thought that would help him when he got to Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_C7-380" href="#Footnote_C7-380" class="fnanchor">C7-380</a> He
asked his wife to help him to hijack an airplane to get there, but gave
up that scheme when she refused.<a id="FNanchor_C7-381" href="#Footnote_C7-381" class="fnanchor">C7-381</a></p>

<p>During this period Oswald may have practiced opening and closing
the bolt on his rifle in a screened porch in his apartment.<a id="FNanchor_C7-382" href="#Footnote_C7-382" class="fnanchor">C7-382</a> In September
he began to review Spanish.<a id="FNanchor_C7-383" href="#Footnote_C7-383" class="fnanchor">C7-383</a> He approved arrangements
for his family to return to Irving, Tex., to live with Mrs. Ruth
Paine.<a id="FNanchor_C7-384" href="#Footnote_C7-384" class="fnanchor">C7-384</a> On September 20, 1963, Mrs. Paine and her two children
arrived in New Orleans from a trip to the East Coast<a id="FNanchor_C7-385" href="#Footnote_C7-385" class="fnanchor">C7-385</a> and left
for Irving with Marina Oswald and June and most of the Oswalds’
effects 3 days later.<a id="FNanchor_C7-386" href="#Footnote_C7-386" class="fnanchor">C7-386</a> While Marina Oswald knew of her husband’s
plan to go to Mexico and thence to Cuba if possible,<a id="FNanchor_C7-387" href="#Footnote_C7-387" class="fnanchor">C7-387</a> Mrs. Paine
was told that Oswald was going to Houston and possibly to Philadelphia
to look for work.<a id="FNanchor_C7-388" href="#Footnote_C7-388" class="fnanchor">C7-388</a></p>

<p>Oswald left for Mexico City on September 25, 1963, and arrived
on September 27, 1963. He went almost directly to the Cuban
Embassy and applied for a visa to Cuba in transit to Russia.<a id="FNanchor_C7-389" href="#Footnote_C7-389" class="fnanchor">C7-389</a> Representing
himself as the head of the New Orleans branch of the
“organization called ‘Fair Play for Cuba,’ he stated his desire that
he should be accepted as a ‘friend’ of the Cuban Revolution.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-390" href="#Footnote_C7-390" class="fnanchor">C7-390</a> He
apparently based his claim for a visa in transit to Russia on his previous
residence, his work permit for that country, and several unidentified
letters in the Russian language. The Cubans would not, however,
give him a visa until he had received one from the Soviets, which
involved a delay of several months. When faced with that situation
Oswald became greatly agitated, and although he later unsuccessfully
attempted to obtain a Soviet visa at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City, he insisted that he was entitled to the Cuban visa because of
his background, partisanship, and personal activities on behalf of the
Cuban movement. He engaged in an angry argument with the
consul who finally told him that “as far as he was concerned he
would not give him a visa” and that “a person like him [Oswald]
in place of aiding the Cuban Revolution, was doing it harm.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-391" href="#Footnote_C7-391" class="fnanchor">C7-391</a></p>

<p>Oswald must have been thoroughly disillusioned when he left Mexico
City on October 2, 1963. In spite of his former residence in the
Soviet Union and his Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities he
had been rebuffed by the officials of both Cuba and the Soviet Union
in Mexico City. Now there appeared to be no chance to get to Cuba,
where he had thought he might find his communist ideal. The U.S.
Government would not permit travel there and as far as the performance
of the Cubans themselves was concerned, he was “disappointed
at not being able to get to Cuba, and he didn’t have any great desire
to do so any more because he had run into, as he himself said—into
bureaucracy and red tape.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span><a id="FNanchor_C7-392" href="#Footnote_C7-392" class="fnanchor">C7-392</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s attempt to go to Cuba was another act which expressed
his hostility toward the United States and its institutions as well as
a concomitant attachment to a country in which he must have thought
were embodied the political principles to which he had been committed
for so long. It should be noted that his interest in Cuba seems to have
increased along with the sense of frustration which must have developed
as he experienced successive failures in his jobs, in his political
activity, and in his personal relationships. In retrospect his attempt
to go to Cuba or return to the Soviet Union may well have been
Oswald’s last escape hatch, his last gambit to extricate himself from
the mediocrity and defeat which plagued him throughout most of
his life.</p>

<p>Oswald’s activities with regard to Cuba raise serious questions as
to how much he might have been motivated in the assassination by
a desire to aid the Castro regime, which President Kennedy so outspokenly
criticized. For example, the Dallas Times Herald of November
19, 1963, prominently reported President Kennedy as having
“all but invited the Cuban people today to overthrow Fidel Castro’s
Communist regime and promised prompt U.S. aid if they do.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-393" href="#Footnote_C7-393" class="fnanchor">C7-393</a> The
Castro regime severely attacked President Kennedy in connection
with the Bay of Pigs affair, the Cuban missile crisis, the ban on
travel to Cuba, the economic embargo against that country, and the
general policy of the United States with regard to Cuba. An examination
of the Militant, to which Oswald subscribed,<a id="FNanchor_C7-394" href="#Footnote_C7-394" class="fnanchor">C7-394</a> for the 3-month
period prior to the assassination reflects an extremely critical attitude
toward President Kennedy and his administration concerning Cuban
policy in general as well as on the issues of automation and civil rights,
issues which appeared to concern Oswald a great deal.<a id="FNanchor_C7-395" href="#Footnote_C7-395" class="fnanchor">C7-395</a> The Militant
also reflected a critical attitude toward President Kennedy’s attempts
to reduce tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union.
It also dealt with the fear of the Castro regime that such a policy
might result in its abandonment by the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The October 7, 1963, issue of the Militant reported Castro as saying
Cuba could not accept a situation where at the same time the United
States was trying to ease world tensions it also “was increasing its
efforts to ‘tighten the noose’ around Cuba.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-396" href="#Footnote_C7-396" class="fnanchor">C7-396</a> Castro’s opposition to
President Kennedy’s attempt to reduce world tensions was also reported
in the October 1, 1963, issue of the Worker, to which Oswald
also subscribed.<a id="FNanchor_C7-397" href="#Footnote_C7-397" class="fnanchor">C7-397</a> In this connection it should be noted that in speaking
of the Worker, Oswald told Michael Paine, apparently in all
seriousness, that “you could tell what they wanted you to do * * * by
reading between the lines, reading the thing and doing a little reading
between the lines.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-398" href="#Footnote_C7-398" class="fnanchor">C7-398</a></p>

<p>The general conflict of views between the United States and Cuba
was, of course, reflected in other media to such an extent that there
can be no doubt that Oswald was aware generally of the critical attitude
that Castro expressed about President Kennedy. Oswald was
asked during the New Orleans radio debate in which he engaged on
August 21, 1963, whether or not he agreed with Castro that President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
Kennedy was a “ruffian and a thief.” He replied that he “would
not agree with that particular wording.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-399" href="#Footnote_C7-399" class="fnanchor">C7-399</a> It should also be noted,
however, that one witness testified that shortly before the assassination
Oswald had expressed approval of President Kennedy’s active role in
the area of civil rights.<a id="FNanchor_C7-400" href="#Footnote_C7-400" class="fnanchor">C7-400</a></p>

<p>Although Oswald could possibly have been motivated in part by his
sympathy for the Castro government, it should be remembered that
his wife testified that he was disappointed with his failure to get to
Cuba and had lost his desire to do so because of the bureaucracy and
red tape which he had encountered.<a id="FNanchor_C7-401" href="#Footnote_C7-401" class="fnanchor">C7-401</a> His unhappy experience with
the Cuban consul seems thus to have reduced his enthusiasm for the
Castro regime and his desire to go to Cuba.</p>

<p>While some of Castro’s more severe criticisms of President Kennedy
might have led Oswald to believe that he would be well received in
Cuba after he had assassinated the American President, it does not
appear that he had any plans to go there. Oswald was carrying only
$13.87 at the time of his arrest, although he had left, apparently by
design, $170 in a wallet in his wife’s room in Irving.<a id="FNanchor_C7-402" href="#Footnote_C7-402" class="fnanchor">C7-402</a> If there was
no conspiracy which would help him escape, the possibility of which
has been considered in chapter VI, it is unlikely that a reasoning
person would plan to attempt to travel from Dallas, Tex., to Cuba with
$13.87 when considerably greater resources were available to him. The
fact that Oswald left behind the funds which might have enabled him
to reach Cuba suggests the absence of any plan to try to flee there and
raises serious questions as to whether or not he ever expected to escape.</p>

<h3 id="hdr151">Possible Influence of Anti-Kennedy Sentiment in Dallas</h3>

<p>It has been suggested that one of the motivating influences operating
on Lee Oswald was the atmosphere in the city of Dallas, especially
an atmosphere of extreme opposition to President Kennedy that
was present in some parts of the Dallas community and which received
publicity there prior to the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C7-403" href="#Footnote_C7-403" class="fnanchor">C7-403</a> Some of that
feeling was expressed in the incident involving then vice-presidential
candidate Johnson during the 1960 campaign, in the treatment of
Ambassador Adlai Stevenson late in October of 1963 and in the
extreme anti-Kennedy newspaper advertisement and handbills that
appeared in Dallas at the time of the President’s visit there.<a id="FNanchor_C7-404" href="#Footnote_C7-404" class="fnanchor">C7-404</a></p>

<p>The Commission has found no evidence that the extreme views expressed
toward President Kennedy by some rightwing groups centered
in Dallas or any other general atmosphere of hate or rightwing
extremism which may have existed in the city of Dallas had any connection
with Oswald’s actions on November 22, 1963. There is, of
course, no way to judge what the effect of the general political ferment
present in that city might have been, even though Oswald was
aware of it. His awareness is shown by a letter that he wrote to
Arnold Johnson of the Communist Party U.S.A., which Johnson
said he did not receive until after the assassination. The letter said in
part:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>On October 23rd, I had attened a ultra-right meeting headed
by General Edwin A. Walker, who lives in Dallas.</p>

<p>This meeting preceded by one day the attack on A. E. Stevenson
at the United Nations Day meeting at which he spoke</p>

<p>As you can see, political friction between “left” and “right” is
very great here.</p>

<p>Could you advise me as to the general view we have on the
American Civil Liberties Union?<a id="FNanchor_C7-405" href="#Footnote_C7-405" class="fnanchor">C7-405</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In any event, the Commission has been unable to find any credible
evidence that Oswald had direct contact or association with any of
the personalities or groups epitomizing or representing the so-called
rightwing, even though he did, as he told Johnson, attend a meeting at
which General Walker spoke to approximately 1,300 persons.<a id="FNanchor_C7-406" href="#Footnote_C7-406" class="fnanchor">C7-406</a> Oswald’s
writings and his reading habits indicate that he had an extreme
dislike of the rightwing, an attitude most clearly reflected by his
attempt to shoot General Walker.</p>

<h3 id="hdr152">Relationship With Wife</h3>

<p>The relations between Lee and Marina Oswald are of great importance
in any attempt to understand Oswald’s possible motivation.
During the period from Oswald’s return from Mexico to the
assassination, he and his wife spent every weekend but one together
at the Irving, Tex., home of Mrs. Ruth Paine, who was then separated
from her husband. The sole exception was the weekend of November
16-17, 1963, the weekend before the assassination, when his wife
asked Oswald not to come to Irving. During the week, Oswald lived
in a roominghouse in Dallas, but he usually called his wife on the telephone
twice a day.<a id="FNanchor_C7-407" href="#Footnote_C7-407" class="fnanchor">C7-407</a> She testified that after his return from Mexico
Oswald “changed for the better. He began to treat me better. * * *
He helped me more—although he always did help. But he was more
attentive.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-408" href="#Footnote_C7-408" class="fnanchor">C7-408</a> Marina Oswald attributed that to their living apart
and to the imminent birth of their second child. She testified that
Oswald “was very happy” about the birth of the child.<a id="FNanchor_C7-409" href="#Footnote_C7-409" class="fnanchor">C7-409</a></p>

<p>While those considerations no doubt had an effect on Oswald’s
attitude toward his family it would seem that the need for support
and sympathy after his recent rebuffs in Mexico City might also have
been important to him. It would not have been the first time that
Oswald sought closer ties with his family in time of adversity.<a id="FNanchor_C7-410" href="#Footnote_C7-410" class="fnanchor">C7-410</a></p>

<p>His past relationships with his wife had been stormy, however, and
it did not seem that she respected him very much. They had been
married after a courtship of only about 6 weeks, a part of which
Oswald spent in the hospital. Oswald’s diary reports that he married
his wife shortly after his proposal of marriage to another girl had
been rejected. He stated that the other girl rejected him partly because
he was an American, a fact that he said she had exploited. He
stated that “In spite of fact I married Marina to hurt Ella [the
girl that had rejected him] I found myself in love with Marina.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span><a id="FNanchor_C7-411" href="#Footnote_C7-411" class="fnanchor">C7-411</a>
Many of the people with whom the Oswalds became acquainted after
their arrival in the United States thought that Marina Oswald had
married her husband primarily in the hope that she would be able to
leave the Soviet Union. Marina Oswald has denied this.<a id="FNanchor_C7-412" href="#Footnote_C7-412" class="fnanchor">C7-412</a></p>

<p>Marina Oswald expressed one aspect of her husband’s attitude
toward her when she testified that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * Lee wanted me to go to Russia, and I told him that if he
wanted me to go then that meant that he didn’t love me, and that
in that case what was the idea of coming to the United States in
the first place. Lee would say that it would be better for me if I
went to Russia. I did not know why. I did not know what he
had in mind. He said he loved me but that it would be better for
me if I went to Russia, and what he had in mind I don’t know.<a id="FNanchor_C7-413" href="#Footnote_C7-413" class="fnanchor">C7-413</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">On the other hand, Oswald objected to the invitation that his wife
had received to live with Mrs. Ruth Paine, which Mrs. Paine had
made in part to give her an alternative to returning to the Soviet
Union.<a id="FNanchor_C7-414" href="#Footnote_C7-414" class="fnanchor">C7-414</a> Marina Oswald wrote to Mrs. Paine that: “Many times he
[Oswald] has recalled this matter to me and said that I am just waiting
for an opportunity to hurt him. It has been the cause of many of
our arguments.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-415" href="#Footnote_C7-415" class="fnanchor">C7-415</a> Oswald claimed that his wife preferred others
to him.<a id="FNanchor_C7-416" href="#Footnote_C7-416" class="fnanchor">C7-416</a> He said this about members of the Russian-speaking group
in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area, whom she said he tried to forbid her
from seeing,<a id="FNanchor_C7-417" href="#Footnote_C7-417" class="fnanchor">C7-417</a> and also about Mrs. Paine.<a id="FNanchor_C7-418" href="#Footnote_C7-418" class="fnanchor">C7-418</a> He specifically made
that claim when his wife refused to come to live with him in Dallas
as he asked her to do on the evening of November 21, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C7-419" href="#Footnote_C7-419" class="fnanchor">C7-419</a></p>

<p>The instability of their relations was probably a function of the
personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations
with his wife. He apparently attempted to be “the Commander” by
dictating many of the details of their married life.<a id="FNanchor_C7-420" href="#Footnote_C7-420" class="fnanchor">C7-420</a> While Marina
Oswald said that her husband wanted her to learn English,<a id="FNanchor_C7-421" href="#Footnote_C7-421" class="fnanchor">C7-421</a> he made
no attempt to help her and there are other indications that he did not
want her to learn that language. Oswald apparently wished to continue
practicing his own Russian with her.<a id="FNanchor_C7-422" href="#Footnote_C7-422" class="fnanchor">C7-422</a> Lieutenant Martello of
the New Orleans police testified that Oswald stated that he did not
speak English in his family because he did not want them to become
Americanized.<a id="FNanchor_C7-423" href="#Footnote_C7-423" class="fnanchor">C7-423</a> Marina Oswald’s inability to speak English also
made it more difficult for her to have an independent existence in this
country. Oswald struck his wife on occasion,<a id="FNanchor_C7-424" href="#Footnote_C7-424" class="fnanchor">C7-424</a> did not want her to
drink, smoke or wear cosmetics<a id="FNanchor_C7-425" href="#Footnote_C7-425" class="fnanchor">C7-425</a> and generally treated her with lack
of respect in the presence of others.<a id="FNanchor_C7-426" href="#Footnote_C7-426" class="fnanchor">C7-426</a></p>

<p>The difficulties which Oswald’s problems would have caused him
in any relationship were probably not reduced by his wife’s conduct.
Katherine Ford, with whom Marina Oswald stayed during her separation
from her husband in November of 1962, thought that Marina
Oswald was immature in her thinking and partly responsible for the
difficulties that the Oswalds were having at that time.<a id="FNanchor_C7-427" href="#Footnote_C7-427" class="fnanchor">C7-427</a> Mrs. Ford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
said that Marina Oswald admitted that she provoked Oswald on occasion.<a id="FNanchor_C7-428" href="#Footnote_C7-428" class="fnanchor">C7-428</a>
There can be little doubt that some provocation existed.
Oswald once struck his wife because of a letter which she wrote to
a former boy friend in Russia. In the letter Marina Oswald stated
that her husband had changed a great deal and that she was very lonely
in the United States. She was “sorry that I had not married him
[the Russian boy friend] instead, that it would have been much easier
for me.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-429" href="#Footnote_C7-429" class="fnanchor">C7-429</a> The letter fell into Oswald’s hands when it was returned
to his post office box because of insufficient postage, which apparently
resulted from an increase in postal rates of which his wife had been
unaware.<a id="FNanchor_C7-430" href="#Footnote_C7-430" class="fnanchor">C7-430</a> Oswald read the letter, but refused to believe that it
was sincere, even though his wife insisted to him that it was. As a
result Oswald struck her, as to which she testified: “Generally, I think
that was right, for such things that is the right thing to do. There
was some grounds for it.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-431" href="#Footnote_C7-431" class="fnanchor">C7-431</a></p>

<p>Although she denied it in some of her testimony before the Commission,<a id="FNanchor_C7-432" href="#Footnote_C7-432" class="fnanchor">C7-432</a>
it appears that Marina Oswald also complained that her
husband was not able to provide more material things for her.<a id="FNanchor_C7-433" href="#Footnote_C7-433" class="fnanchor">C7-433</a> On
that issue George De Mohrenschildt, who was probably as close to the
Oswalds as anyone else during their first stay in Dallas, said that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>She was annoying him all the time—“Why don’t you make
some money?” * * * Poor guy was going out of his mind. * * *</p>

<p>We told her she should not annoy him—poor guy, he is doing
his best, “Don’t annoy him so much.” * * *<a id="FNanchor_C7-434" href="#Footnote_C7-434" class="fnanchor">C7-434</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The De Mohrenschildts also testified that “right in front” of Oswald
Marina Oswald complained about Oswald’s inadequacy as a husband.<a id="FNanchor_C7-435" href="#Footnote_C7-435" class="fnanchor">C7-435</a>
Mrs. Oswald told another of her friends that Oswald was
very cold to her, that they very seldom had sexual relations and that
Oswald “was not a man.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-436" href="#Footnote_C7-436" class="fnanchor">C7-436</a> She also told Mrs. Paine that she was
not satisfied with her sexual relations with Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C7-437" href="#Footnote_C7-437" class="fnanchor">C7-437</a></p>

<p>Marina Oswald also ridiculed her husband’s political views, thereby
tearing down his view of his own importance. He was very much
interested in autobiographical works of outstanding statesmen of the
United States, to whom his wife thought he compared himself.<a id="FNanchor_C7-438" href="#Footnote_C7-438" class="fnanchor">C7-438</a> She
said he was different from other people in “At least his imagination,
his fantasy, which was quite unfounded, as to the fact that he was an
outstanding man.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-439" href="#Footnote_C7-439" class="fnanchor">C7-439</a> She said that she “always tried to point out
to him that he was a man like any others who were around us.
But he simply could not understand that.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-440" href="#Footnote_C7-440" class="fnanchor">C7-440</a> Jeanne De Mohrenschildt,
however, thought that Marina Oswald “said things that
will hurt men’s pride.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-441" href="#Footnote_C7-441" class="fnanchor">C7-441</a> She said that if she ever spoke to her
husband the way Marina Oswald spoke to her husband, “we would
not last long.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-442" href="#Footnote_C7-442" class="fnanchor">C7-442</a> Mrs. De Mohrenschildt thought that Oswald, whom
she compared to “a puppy dog that everybody kicked,”<a id="FNanchor_C7-443" href="#Footnote_C7-443" class="fnanchor">C7-443</a> had a lot
of good qualities, in spite of the fact that “Nobody said anything good
about him.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-444" href="#Footnote_C7-444" class="fnanchor">C7-444</a> She had “the impression that he was just pushed,
pushed, pushed, and she [Marina Oswald] was probably nagging, nagging,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
nagging.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-445" href="#Footnote_C7-445" class="fnanchor">C7-445</a> She thought that he might not have become involved
in the assassination if people had been kinder to him.<a id="FNanchor_C7-446" href="#Footnote_C7-446" class="fnanchor">C7-446</a></p>

<p>In spite of these difficulties, however, and in the face of the economic
problems that were always with them, things apparently went quite
smoothly from the time Oswald returned from Mexico until the weekend
of November 16-17, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C7-447" href="#Footnote_C7-447" class="fnanchor">C7-447</a> Mrs. Paine was planning a birthday
party for one of her children on that weekend and her husband,
Michael, was to be at the house. Marina Oswald said that she knew
her husband did not like Michael Paine and so she asked him not to
come out that weekend, even though he wanted to do so. She testified
that she told him “that he shouldn’t come every week, that perhaps it
is not convenient for Ruth that the whole family be there, live there.”
She testified that he responded: “As you wish. If you don’t want me
to come, I won’t.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-448" href="#Footnote_C7-448" class="fnanchor">C7-448</a> Ruth Paine testified that she heard Marina
Oswald tell Oswald about the birthday party.<a id="FNanchor_C7-449" href="#Footnote_C7-449" class="fnanchor">C7-449</a></p>

<p>On Sunday, November 17, 1963, Ruth Paine and Marina Oswald
decided to call Oswald<a id="FNanchor_C7-450" href="#Footnote_C7-450" class="fnanchor">C7-450</a> at the place where he was living, unbeknownst
to them, under the name of O. H. Lee.<a id="FNanchor_C7-451" href="#Footnote_C7-451" class="fnanchor">C7-451</a> They asked for
Lee Oswald who was not called to the telephone because he was known
by the other name.<a id="FNanchor_C7-452" href="#Footnote_C7-452" class="fnanchor">C7-452</a> When Oswald called the next day his wife
became very angry about his use of the alias.<a id="FNanchor_C7-453" href="#Footnote_C7-453" class="fnanchor">C7-453</a> He said that he
used it because “he did not want his landlady to know his real name
because she might read in the paper of the fact that he had been in
Russia and that he had been questioned.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-454" href="#Footnote_C7-454" class="fnanchor">C7-454</a> Oswald also said that
he did not want the FBI to know where he lived “Because their visits
were not very pleasant for him and he thought that he loses jobs
because the FBI visits the place of his employment.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-455" href="#Footnote_C7-455" class="fnanchor">C7-455</a> While the
facts of his defection had become known in New Orleans as a result
of his radio debate with Bringuier,<a id="FNanchor_C7-456" href="#Footnote_C7-456" class="fnanchor">C7-456</a> it would appear to be unlikely
that his landlady in Dallas would see anything in the newspaper
about his defection, unless he engaged in activities similar to those
which had led to the disclosure of his defection in New Orleans.
Furthermore, even though it appears that at times Oswald was really
upset by visits of the FBI, it does not appear that he ever lost his
job because of its activities, although he may well not have been
aware of that fact.<a id="FNanchor_C7-457" href="#Footnote_C7-457" class="fnanchor">C7-457</a></p>

<p>While Oswald’s concern about the FBI had some basis in fact, in
that FBI agents had interviewed him in the past and had renewed their
interest to some extent after his Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities
had become known, he exaggerated their concern for him. Marina
Oswald thought he did so in order to emphasize his importance.<a id="FNanchor_C7-458" href="#Footnote_C7-458" class="fnanchor">C7-458</a>
For example, in his letter of November 9, 1963, to the Soviet Embassy
in Washington, he asked about the entrance visas for which he and
his wife had previously applied. He absolved the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City of any blame for his difficulties there. He advised the
Washington Embassy that the FBI was “not now” interested in his
Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities, but noted that the FBI “has
visited us here in Dallas, Texas, on November 1. Agent James P.
Hasty warned me that if I engaged in F.P.C.C. activities in Texas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
the F.B.I. will again take an ‘interrest’ in me.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-459" href="#Footnote_C7-459" class="fnanchor">C7-459</a> Neither Hosty nor
any other agent of the FBI spoke to Oswald on any subject
from August 10, 1963, to the time of the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C7-460" href="#Footnote_C7-460" class="fnanchor">C7-460</a> The claimed
warning was one more of Oswald’s fabrications. Hosty had come to
the Paine residence on November 1 and 5, 1963, but did not issue
any such warning or suggest that Marina Oswald defect from the Soviet
Union and remain in the United States under FBI protection, as
Oswald went on to say.<a id="FNanchor_C7-461" href="#Footnote_C7-461" class="fnanchor">C7-461</a> In Oswald’s imagination “I and my wife
strongly protested these tactics by the notorious F.B.I.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-462" href="#Footnote_C7-462" class="fnanchor">C7-462</a> In fact,
his wife testified that she only said that she would prefer not to receive
any more visits from the Bureau because of the “very exciting and
disturbing effect” they had upon her husband,<a id="FNanchor_C7-463" href="#Footnote_C7-463" class="fnanchor">C7-463</a> who was not even
present at that time.<a id="FNanchor_C7-464" href="#Footnote_C7-464" class="fnanchor">C7-464</a></p>

<p>The arguments he used to justify his use of the alias suggest that
Oswald may have come to think that the whole world was becoming
involved in an increasingly complex conspiracy against him. He may
have felt he could never tell when the FBI was going to appear on
the scene or who else was going to find out about his defection and
use it against him as had been done in New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_C7-465" href="#Footnote_C7-465" class="fnanchor">C7-465</a> On the other
hand, the concern he expressed about the FBI may have been just
another story to support the objective he sought in his letter.</p>

<p>Those arguments, however, were not persuasive to Marina Oswald,
to whom “it was nothing terrible if people were to find out that he
had been in Russia.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-466" href="#Footnote_C7-466" class="fnanchor">C7-466</a> She asked Oswald: “After all, when will all
your foolishness come to an end? All of these comedies. First one
thing and then another. And now this fictitious name.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-467" href="#Footnote_C7-467" class="fnanchor">C7-467</a> She said:
“On Monday [November 18, 1963] he called several times, but after I
hung up on him and didn’t want to talk to him he did not call again.
He then arrived on Thursday [November 21, 1963].”<a id="FNanchor_C7-468" href="#Footnote_C7-468" class="fnanchor">C7-468</a></p>

<p>The events of that evening can best be appreciated through Marina
Oswald’s testimony:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Q. Did your husband give any reason for coming home on
Thursday?</p>

<p>A. He said that he was lonely because he hadn’t come the preceding
weekend, and he wanted to make his peace with me.</p>

<p>Q. Did you say anything to him then?</p>

<p>A. He tried to talk to me but I would not answer him, and he
was very upset.</p>

<p>Q. Were you upset with him?</p>

<p>A. I was angry, of course. He was not angry—he was upset.
I was angry. He tried very hard to please me. He spent quite
a bit of time putting away diapers and played with the children
on the street.</p>

<p>Q. How did you indicate to him that you were angry with him?</p>

<p>A. By not talking to him.</p>

<p>Q. And how did he show that he was upset?</p>

<p>A. He was upset over the fact that I would not answer him.
He tried to start a conversation with me several times, but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
would not answer. And he said that he didn’t want me to be
angry at him because this upsets him.</p>

<p>On that day, he suggested that we rent an apartment in Dallas.
He said that he was tired of living alone and perhaps the reason
for my being so angry was the fact that we were not living together.
That if I want to he would rent an apartment in Dallas
tomorrow—that he didn’t want me to remain with Ruth any
longer, but wanted me to live with him in Dallas.</p>

<p>He repeated this not once but several times, but I refused.
And he said that once again I was preferring my friends to him,
and that I didn’t need him.</p>

<p>Q. What did you say to that?</p>

<p>A. I said it would be better if I remained with Ruth until
the holidays, he would come, and we would all meet together.
That this was better because while he was living alone and I
stayed with Ruth, we were spending less money. And I told him
to buy me a washing machine, because two children it became
too difficult to wash by hand.</p>

<p>Q. What did he say to that?</p>

<p>A. He said he would buy me a washing machine.</p>

<p>Q. What did you say to that?</p>

<p>A. Thank you. That it would be better if he bought something
for himself—that I would manage.<a id="FNanchor_C7-469" href="#Footnote_C7-469" class="fnanchor">C7-469</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That night Oswald went to bed before his wife retired. She did
not speak to him when she joined him there, although she thought that
he was still awake. The next morning he left for work before anyone
else arose.<a id="FNanchor_C7-470" href="#Footnote_C7-470" class="fnanchor">C7-470</a> For the first time he left his wedding ring in a cup on
the dresser in his room.<a id="FNanchor_C7-471" href="#Footnote_C7-471" class="fnanchor">C7-471</a> He also left $170 in a wallet in one of the
dresser drawers. He took with him $13.87<a id="FNanchor_C7-472" href="#Footnote_C7-472" class="fnanchor">C7-472</a> and the long brown package
that Frazier and Mrs. Randle saw him carry and which he was
to take to the School Book Depository.<a id="FNanchor_C7-473" href="#Footnote_C7-473" class="fnanchor">C7-473</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr153">The Unanswered Questions</h3>

<p>No one will ever know what passed through Oswald’s mind during
the week before November 22, 1963. Instead of returning to Irving
on November 15 for his customary weekend visit, he remained in
Dallas at his wife’s suggestion because of the birthday party. He had
argued with her over the use of an alias and had not called her after
that argument, although he usually telephoned once or twice a day.
Then on Thursday morning, November 21, he asked Frazier for a
ride to Irving that night, stating falsely that he wanted to pick up
some curtain rods to put in an apartment.<a id="FNanchor_C7-474" href="#Footnote_C7-474" class="fnanchor">C7-474</a></p>

<p>He must have planned his attack at the very latest prior to Thursday
morning when he spoke to Frazier. There is, of course, no way to
determine the degree to which he was committed to his plan at that
time. While there is no way to tell when he first began to think specifically
of assassinating the President it should be noted that mention of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
the Trade Mart as the expected site of the Presidential luncheon appeared
in The Dallas Times Herald on November 15, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C7-475" href="#Footnote_C7-475" class="fnanchor">C7-475</a> The
next day that paper announced the final approval of the Trade Mart as
the luncheon site and stated that the motorcade “apparently will
loop through the downtown area, probably on Main Street, en route
from Dallas Love Field” on its way to the Trade Mart on Stemmons
Freeway.<a id="FNanchor_C7-476" href="#Footnote_C7-476" class="fnanchor">C7-476</a> Anyone who was familiar with that area of Dallas would
have known that the motorcade would probably pass the Texas School
Book Depository to get from Main Street onto the Stemmons Freeway.
That fact was made precisely clear in subsequent news stories
on November 19, 20, and 22.<a id="FNanchor_C7-477" href="#Footnote_C7-477" class="fnanchor">C7-477</a></p>

<p>On November 15, 1963, the same day that his wife told him not to
come to Irving, Oswald could have assumed that the Presidential
motorcade would pass in front of his place of work. Whether he
thought about assassinating the President over the weekend can never
be known, but it is reasonably certain that over the weekend he did
think about his wife’s request that he not come to Irving, which was
prompted by the birthday party being held at the Paine home. Oswald
had a highly exaggerated sense of his own importance, but he had
failed at almost everything he had ever tried to do. He had great
difficulty in establishing meaningful relations with other people.
Except for his family he was completely alone. Even though he had
searched—in the Marine Corps, in his ideal of communism, in the
Soviet Union and in his attempt to get to Cuba—he had never found
anything to which he felt he could really belong.</p>

<p>After he returned from his trip to Mexico where his application
to go to Cuba had been sharply rejected, it must have appeared to
him that he was unable to command even the attention of his family.
He could not keep them with him in Dallas, where at least he could
see his children whom, several witnesses testified, he seemed to love.<a id="FNanchor_C7-478" href="#Footnote_C7-478" class="fnanchor">C7-478</a>
His family lived with Mrs. Paine, ostensibly because Oswald could
not afford to keep an apartment in Dallas, but it was also, at least in
part, because his wife did not want to live there with him.<a id="FNanchor_C7-479" href="#Footnote_C7-479" class="fnanchor">C7-479</a> Now
it appeared that he was not welcome at the Paine home, where he had
spent every previous weekend since his return from Mexico and his
wife was once again calling into question his judgment, this time
concerning his use of an alias.</p>

<p>The conversation on Monday, November 18, 1963, ended when
Marina Oswald hung up and refused to talk to him. Although he
may long before have decided on the course he was to follow and may
have told his wife the things he did on the evening of November 21,
1963, merely to disarm her and to provide a justification of sorts, both
she and Mrs. Paine thought he had come home to make up after the
fight on Monday.<a id="FNanchor_C7-480" href="#Footnote_C7-480" class="fnanchor">C7-480</a> Thoughts of his personal difficulties must have
been at least partly on his mind when he went to Irving on Thursday
night and told his wife that he was lonely, that he wanted to make
peace with her and bring his family to Dallas where they could live
with him again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
The Commission does not believe that the relations between Oswald
and his wife caused him to assassinate the President. It is unlikely
that the motivation was that simple. The feelings of hostility and
aggression which seem to have played such an important part in
Oswald’s life were part of his character long before he met his wife
and such a favorable opportunity to strike at a figure as great as the
President would probably never have come to him again.</p>

<p>Oswald’s behavior after the assassination throws little light on his
motives. The fact that he took so little money with him when he
left Irving in the morning indicates that he did not expect to get
very far from Dallas on his own and suggests the possibility, as did
his note to his wife just prior to the attempt on General Walker,
that he did not expect to escape at all. On the other hand, he could
have traveled some distance with the money he did have and he did return
to his room where he obtained his revolver. He then killed
Patrolman Tippit when that police officer apparently tried to question
him after he had left his roominghouse and he vigorously resisted
arrest when he was finally apprehended in the Texas Theatre. Although
it is not fully corroborated by others who were present, two
officers have testified that at the time of his arrest Oswald said something
to the effect that “it’s all over now.”<a id="FNanchor_C7-481" href="#Footnote_C7-481" class="fnanchor">C7-481</a></p>

<p>Oswald was overbearing and arrogant throughout much of the time
between his arrest and his own death.<a id="FNanchor_C7-482" href="#Footnote_C7-482" class="fnanchor">C7-482</a> He consistently refused to
admit involvement in the assassination or in the killing of Patrolman
Tippit.<a id="FNanchor_C7-483" href="#Footnote_C7-483" class="fnanchor">C7-483</a> While he did become enraged at at least one point in his
interrogation, the testimony of the officers present indicates that he
handled himself with considerable composure during his questioning.
He admitted nothing that would damage him but discussed other
matters quite freely.<a id="FNanchor_C7-484" href="#Footnote_C7-484" class="fnanchor">C7-484</a> His denials under questioning, which have no
probative value in view of the many readily demonstrable lies he told
at that time<a id="FNanchor_C7-485" href="#Footnote_C7-485" class="fnanchor">C7-485</a> and in the face of the overwhelming evidence against
him which has been set forth above, only served to prolong the period
during which he was the center of the attention of the entire world.</p>

<h3 id="hdr154">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Many factors were undoubtedly involved in Oswald’s motivation
for the assassination, and the Commission does not believe that it can
ascribe to him any one motive or group of motives. It is apparent,
however, that Oswald was moved by an overriding hostility to his
environment. He does not appear to have been able to establish meaningful
relationships with other people. He was perpetually discontented
with the world around him. Long before the assassination he
expressed his hatred for American society and acted in protest against
it. Oswald’s search for what he conceived to be the perfect society was
doomed from the start. He sought for himself a place in history—a
role as the “great man” who would be recognized as having been in
advance of his times. His commitment to Marxism and communism
appears to have been another important factor in his motivation. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
also had demonstrated a capacity to act decisively and without regard
to the consequences when such action would further his aims of the
moment. Out of these and the many other factors which may have
molded the character of Lee Harvey Oswald there emerged a man
capable of assassinating President Kennedy.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Protection of the President</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In the</span> 100 years since 1865 four Presidents of the United States
have been assassinated—Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield,
William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy. During this same
period there were three other attacks on the life of a President, a
President-elect, and a candidate for the Presidency, which narrowly
failed: on Theodore Roosevelt while campaigning in October of
1912; on President-elect Franklin Delano Roosevelt, when visiting
Miami on February 15, 1933; and on President Harry S. Truman
on November 1, 1950, when his temporary residence, Blair House, was
attacked by Puerto Rican Nationalists.<a id="FNanchor_C8-1" href="#Footnote_C8-1" class="fnanchor">C8-1</a> One out of every five Presidents
since 1865 has been assassinated; there have been attempts on
the lives of one out of every three.</p>

<p>Prompted by these dismaying statistics, the Commission has inquired
into the problems and methods of Presidential protection in
effect at the time of President Kennedy’s assassination. This study
has led the Commission to conclude that the public interest might be
served by any contribution it can make to the improvement of protective
arrangements. The Commission has not undertaken a comprehensive
examination of all facets of this subject; rather, it has
devoted its time and resources to those broader aspects of Presidential
protection to which the events of last November called attention.</p>

<p>In this part of its inquiry the Commission has had full access to
a major study of all phases of protective activities prepared by the
Secret Service for the Secretary of the Treasury following the assassination.
As a result of this study, the Secretary of the Treasury
has prepared a planning document dated August 27, 1964, which
recommends additional personnel and facilities to enable the Secret
Service to expand its protection capabilities. The Secretary of the
Treasury submitted this planning document on August 31, 1964, to
the Bureau of the Budget for review and approval. This planning
document has been made a part of the Commission’s published record;
the underlying staff and consultants’ reports reviewed by the
Commission have not, since a disclosure of such detailed information
relating to protective measures might undermine present methods of
protecting the President. However, all information considered by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
the Commission which pertains to the protective function as it was
carried out in Dallas has been published as part of this report.</p>

<p>The protection of the President of the United States is an immensely
difficult and complex task. It is unlikely that measures can
be devised to eliminate entirely the multitude of diverse dangers that
may arise, particularly when the President is traveling in this country
or abroad. The protective task is further complicated by the
reluctance of Presidents to take security precautions which might
interfere with the performance of their duties, or their desire to have
frequent and easy access to the people. The adequacy of existing
procedures can fairly be assessed only after full consideration of the
difficulty of the protective assignment, with particular attention to
the diverse roles which the President is expected to fill. After reviewing
this aspect of the matter this chapter will set forth the
Commission’s conclusions regarding certain protective measures in
force at the time of the Dallas trip and propose recommendations
for improvements.</p>

<h3 id="hdr156">THE NATURE OF THE PROTECTIVE ASSIGNMENT</h3>

<p>The President is Head of State, Chief Executive, Commander in
Chief, and leader of a political party. As the ceremonial head of the
Government the President must discharge a wide range of public
duties, not only in Washington but throughout the land. In this role
he appears to the American people, in the words of William Howard
Taft, as “the personal embodiment and representative of their dignity
and majesty.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-2" href="#Footnote_C8-2" class="fnanchor">C8-2</a> As Chief Executive, the President controls the
exercise of the vast, almost incalculable powers of the executive branch
of the Federal Government. As Commander in Chief of the Armed
Forces, he must maintain ultimate authority over the development and
disposition of our military power. Finally, in accordance with George
Washington’s maxim that Americans have a government “of accommodation
as well as a government of laws,”<a id="FNanchor_C8-3" href="#Footnote_C8-3" class="fnanchor">C8-3</a> it is the President’s right
and duty to be the active leader of his party, as when he seeks to be
reelected or to maintain his party in power.</p>

<p>In all of these roles the President must go to the people. Exposure
of the President to public view through travel among the people of
this country is a great and historic tradition of American life. Desired
by both the President and the public, it is an indispensable means of
communication between the two. More often than not, Presidential
journeys have served more than one purpose at the same time: ceremonial,
administrative, political.</p>

<p>From George Washington to John F. Kennedy, such journeys have
been a normal part of the President’s activities. To promote nationwide
acceptance of his administration Washington made grand tours
that served also to excite interest in the Presidency.<a id="FNanchor_C8-4" href="#Footnote_C8-4" class="fnanchor">C8-4</a> In recent years,
Presidential journeys have been frequent and extensive, partly because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
of the greater speed and comfort of travel and partly because
of the greater demands made on the President. It is now possible for
Presidents to travel the length and breadth of a land far larger
than the United States in 1789 in less time than it took George Washington
to travel from New York to Mount Vernon or Thomas Jefferson
from Washington to Monticello. During his Presidency, Franklin D.
Roosevelt made almost 400 journeys and traveled more than 350,000
miles.<a id="FNanchor_C8-5" href="#Footnote_C8-5" class="fnanchor">C8-5</a> Since 1945, Roosevelt’s successors have ranged the world, and
their foreign journeys have come to be accepted as normal rather than
extraordinary.</p>

<p>John F. Kennedy’s journey to Texas in November 1963 was in this
tradition. His friend and Special Assistant Kenneth O’Donnell, who
accompanied him on his last visit to Dallas, stated the President’s
views of his responsibilities with simplicity and clarity:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The President’s views of his responsibilities as President of the
United States were that he meet the people, that he go out to their
homes and see them, and allow them to see him, and discuss, if
possible, the views of the world as he sees it, the problems of the
country as he sees them. And he felt that leaving Washington
for the President of the United States was a most necessary—not
only for the people, but for the President himself, that he expose
himself to the actual basic problems that were disturbing the
American people. It helped him in his job here, he was able
to come back here with a fresh view of many things. I think he
felt very strongly that the President ought to get out of Washington,
and go meet the people on a regular basis.<a id="FNanchor_C8-6" href="#Footnote_C8-6" class="fnanchor">C8-6</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever their purpose, Presidential journeys have greatly enlarged
and complicated the task of protecting the President. The
Secret Service and the Federal, State, and local law enforcement
agencies which cooperate with it, have been confronted in recent years
with increasingly difficult problems, created by the greater exposure
of the President during his travels and the greater diversity of the
audiences he must face in a world torn by conflicting ideologies.</p>

<p>If the sole goal were to protect the life of the President, it could be
accomplished with reasonable assurance despite the multiple roles
he must play. But his very position as representative of the people
prevents him from effectively shielding himself from the people. He
cannot and will not take the precautions of a dictator or a sovereign.
Under our system, measures must be sought to afford security without
impeding the President’s performance of his many functions. The
protection of the President must be thorough but inconspicuous to
avoid even the suggestion of a garrison state. The rights of private
individuals must not be infringed. If the protective job is well done,
its performance will be evident only in the unexceptional fact of its
success. The men in charge of protecting the President, confronted
by complex problems and limited as they are in the measures they may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
employ, must depend upon the utmost cooperation and understanding
from the public and the President.</p>

<p>The problem and the reasonable approach to its solution were ably
stated in a memorandum prepared by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover
for the President soon after the assassination:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The degree of security that can be afforded the President of the
United States is dependent to a considerable extent upon the
degree of contact with the general public desired by the President.
Absolute security is neither practical nor possible. An
approach to complete security would require the President to
operate in a sort of vacuum, isolated from the general public and
behind impregnable barriers. His travel would be in secret; his
public appearances would be behind bulletproof glass.</p>

<p>A more practical approach necessitates compromise. Any
travel, any contact with the general public, involves a calculated
risk on the part of the President and the men responsible for his
protection. Such risks can be lessened when the President recognizes
the security problem, has confidence in the dedicated Secret
Service men who are ready to lay down their lives for him and
accepts the necessary security precautions which they recommend.
Many Presidents have been understandably impatient with the
security precautions which many years of experience dictate
because these precautions reduce the President’s privacy and the
access to him of the people of the country. Nevertheless the procedures
and advice should be accepted if the President wishes to
have any security.<a id="FNanchor_C8-7" href="#Footnote_C8-7" class="fnanchor">C8-7</a></p></blockquote>

<h3 id="hdr157">EVALUATION OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY</h3>

<p>The history of Presidential protection shows growing recognition
over the years that the job must be done by able, dedicated, thoroughly
professional personnel, using the best technical equipment
that can be devised.<a id="FNanchor_C8-8" href="#Footnote_C8-8" class="fnanchor">C8-8</a> The assassination of President Kennedy demands
an examination of the protective measures employed to safeguard
him and an inquiry whether improvements can be made which
will reduce the risk of another such tragedy. This section considers
first the means used to locate potential sources of danger to the President
in time to take appropriate precautions. In this connection the
information available to Federal agencies about Lee Harvey Oswald
is set out and the reasons why this information was not furnished
to the Secret Service appraised. Second, the adequacy of other advance
preparations for the security of the President during his visit
to Dallas, largely measures taken by the Secret Service, is considered.
Finally, the performance of those charged with the immediate responsibility
of protecting the President on November 22 is reviewed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span></p>

<h4 id="hdr158">Intelligence Functions Relating to Presidential Protection at the
Time of the Dallas Trip</h4>

<p>A basic element of Presidential protection is the identification and
elimination of possible sources of danger to the President before the
danger becomes actual. The Secret Service has attempted to perform
this function through the activities of its Protective Research Section
and requests to other agencies, Federal and local, for useful information.
The Commission has concluded that at the time of the
assassination the arrangements relied upon by the Secret Service
to perform this function were seriously deficient.</p>

<p><i>Adequacy of preventive intelligence operations of the Secret Service.</i>—The
main job of the Protective Research Section (PRS) is to
collect, process, and evaluate information about persons or groups
who may be a danger to the President. In addition to this function,
PRS is responsible for such tasks as obtaining clearance of some categories
of White House employees and all tradesmen who service the
White House, the security processing of gifts sent to the President,
and technical inspections against covert listening devices.<a id="FNanchor_C8-9" href="#Footnote_C8-9" class="fnanchor">C8-9</a> At the
time of the assassination PRS was a very small group, comprised of
12 specialists and 3 clerks.<a id="FNanchor_C8-10" href="#Footnote_C8-10" class="fnanchor">C8-10</a></p>

<p>Many persons call themselves to the attention of PRS by attempting
to visit the President for bizarre reasons or by writing or in some
other way attempting to communicate with him in a threatening or
abusive manner or with undue persistence. Robert I. Bouck, special
agent in charge of PRS, estimated that most of the material received
by his office originated in this fashion or from the occasional investigations
initiated by the Secret Service, while the balance was furnished
to PRS by other Federal agencies, with primary source
being the FBI.<a id="FNanchor_C8-11" href="#Footnote_C8-11" class="fnanchor">C8-11</a> The total volume of information received by PRS
has risen steadily. In 1943 PRS received approximately 9,000 items
of information; in 1953 this had increased to more than 17,000 items;
in 1963 the total exceeded 32,000 items.<a id="FNanchor_C8-12" href="#Footnote_C8-12" class="fnanchor">C8-12</a> Since many items may pertain
to a single case, these figures do not show the caseload. In the
period from November 1961 to November 1963, PRS received items
in 8,709 cases.<a id="FNanchor_C8-13" href="#Footnote_C8-13" class="fnanchor">C8-13</a></p>

<p>Before the assassination of President Kennedy, PRS expressed
its interest in receiving information on suspects in very general terms.
For example, PRS instructed the White House mailroom, a source
of much PRS data, to refer all communications on identified existing
cases and, in addition, any communication “that in any way indicates
anyone may have possible intention of harming the President.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-14" href="#Footnote_C8-14" class="fnanchor">C8-14</a>
Slightly more specific criteria were established for PRS personnel
processing White House mail referred by the White House mailroom,
but again the standards were very general.<a id="FNanchor_C8-15" href="#Footnote_C8-15" class="fnanchor">C8-15</a> These instructions to
PRS personnel appear to be the only instance where an effort was
made to reduce the criteria to writing.<a id="FNanchor_C8-16" href="#Footnote_C8-16" class="fnanchor">C8-16</a> When requested to provide
a specific statement of the standards employed by PRS in deciding
what information to seek and retain, the Secret Service responded:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The criteria in effect prior to November 22, 1963, for determining
whether to accept material for the PRS general files were
broad and flexible. All material is and was desired, accepted,
and filed if it indicated or tended to indicate that the safety
of the President is or might be in danger, either at the present
or in the future. * * * There are many actions, situations, and
incidents that may indicate such potential danger. Some are
specific, such as threats; danger may be implied from others, such
as membership or activity in an organization which believes in
assassination as a political weapon. All material received by
PRS was separately screened and a determination made as to
whether the information might indicate possible harm to the
President. If the material was evaluated as indicating some
potential danger to the President—no matter how small—it was
indexed in the general PRS files under the name of the individual
or group of individuals to whom that material related.<a id="FNanchor_C8-17" href="#Footnote_C8-17" class="fnanchor">C8-17</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The general files of PRS consist of folders on individuals, card indexed
by name. The files are manually maintained, without use of
any automatic data-processing techniques.<a id="FNanchor_C8-18" href="#Footnote_C8-18" class="fnanchor">C8-18</a> At the time of the assassination,
the active PRS general files contained approximately 50,000
cases accumulated over a 20-year period,<a id="FNanchor_C8-19" href="#Footnote_C8-19" class="fnanchor">C8-19</a> some of which included
more than one individual. A case file was established if the information
available suggested that the subject might be a danger to the President.
Many of these cases were not investigated by PRS. The case file
served merely as a repository for information until enough had accumulated
to warrant an investigation.<a id="FNanchor_C8-20" href="#Footnote_C8-20" class="fnanchor">C8-20</a> During the period November
1961 to November 1963, PRS investigated 34 newly established or
reactivated cases concerning residents of Texas.<a id="FNanchor_C8-21" href="#Footnote_C8-21" class="fnanchor">C8-21</a> Most of these cases
involved persons who used threatening language in communications
to or about the President. An additional 115 cases concerning Texas
residents were established but not investigated.<a id="FNanchor_C8-22" href="#Footnote_C8-22" class="fnanchor">C8-22</a></p>

<p>When PRS learns of an individual whose conduct warrants scrutiny,
it requests an investigation by the closest Secret Service field office,<a id="FNanchor_C8-23" href="#Footnote_C8-23" class="fnanchor">C8-23</a>
of which there are 65 throughout the country. If the field office
determines that the case should be subject to continuing review, PRS
establishes a file which requires a checkup at least every 6 months.<a id="FNanchor_C8-24" href="#Footnote_C8-24" class="fnanchor">C8-24</a>
This might involve a personal interview or interviews with members
of the person’s household.<a id="FNanchor_C8-25" href="#Footnote_C8-25" class="fnanchor">C8-25</a> Wherever possible, the Secret Service
arranges for the family and friends of the individual, and local law
enforcement officials, to advise the field office if the subject displays
signs of increased danger or plans to leave his home area. At the
time of the assassination there were approximately 400 persons
throughout the country who were subject to periodic review.<a id="FNanchor_C8-26" href="#Footnote_C8-26" class="fnanchor">C8-26</a></p>

<p>If PRS concludes after investigation that an individual presents
a significant danger to the life of the President, his name is placed in
a “trip index file” which is maintained on a geographical field office
basis.<a id="FNanchor_C8-27" href="#Footnote_C8-27" class="fnanchor">C8-27</a> At the time of the assassination the names of about 100
persons were in this index, all of whom were included in the group of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
400 being reviewed regularly.<a id="FNanchor_C8-28" href="#Footnote_C8-28" class="fnanchor">C8-28</a> PRS also maintains an album of
photographs and descriptions of about 12 to 15 individuals who are
regarded as clear risks to the President and who do not have a fixed
place of residence.<a id="FNanchor_C8-29" href="#Footnote_C8-29" class="fnanchor">C8-29</a> Members of the White House detail of the
Secret Service have copies of this album.<a id="FNanchor_C8-30" href="#Footnote_C8-30" class="fnanchor">C8-30</a></p>

<p>Individuals who are regarded as dangerous to the President and
who are in penal or hospital custody are listed only in the general
files of PRS, but there is a system for the immediate notification of
the Secret Service by the confining institution when a subject is
released or escapes.<a id="FNanchor_C8-31" href="#Footnote_C8-31" class="fnanchor">C8-31</a> PRS attempts to eliminate serious risks by
hospitalization or, where necessary, the prosecution of persons who
have committed an offense such as threatening the President.<a id="FNanchor_C8-32" href="#Footnote_C8-32" class="fnanchor">C8-32</a> In
June 1964 PRS had arrangements to be notified about the release or
escape of approximately 1,000 persons.<a id="FNanchor_C8-33" href="#Footnote_C8-33" class="fnanchor">C8-33</a></p>

<p>In summary, at the time of the assassination PRS had received,
over a 20-year period, basic information on some 50,000 cases; it had
arrangements to be notified about release from confinement in roughly
1,000 cases; it had established periodic regular review of the status
of 400 individuals; it regarded approximately 100 of these 400 cases
as serious risks and 12 to 15 of these cases as highly dangerous risks.
Members of the White House detail were expected to familiarize themselves
with the descriptions and photographs of the highest risk cases.
The cases subject to periodic review and the 100 or so cases in the
higher risk category were filed on a geographic basis, and could conveniently
be reviewed by a Secret Service agent preparing for a Presidential
trip to a particular part of the country. These were the files
reviewed by PRS on November 8, 1963, at the request of Special Agent
Lawson, advance agent for President Kennedy’s trip to Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C8-34" href="#Footnote_C8-34" class="fnanchor">C8-34</a> The
general files of PRS were not indexed by geographic location and were
of little use in preparing for a Presidential visit to a specific locality.</p>

<p>Secret Service requests to other agencies for intelligence information
were no more specific than the broad and general instructions to
its own agents and the White House mailroom. The head of PRS
testified that the Secret Service requested other agencies to provide
“any and all information that they may come in contact with that
would indicate danger to the President.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-35" href="#Footnote_C8-35" class="fnanchor">C8-35</a> These requests were not
communicated in writing by the Secret Service; rather, the Service
depended on the personal liaison maintained by PRS with the headquarters
of the Federal intelligence agencies, particularly the FBI,
and at the working level with personnel of the field offices of the
various agencies.<a id="FNanchor_C8-36" href="#Footnote_C8-36" class="fnanchor">C8-36</a> The Service frequently participated in the training
programs of other law enforcement agencies, and agents from
other agencies attended the regular Secret Service training schools.
Presidential protection was an important topic in these training
programs.<a id="FNanchor_C8-37" href="#Footnote_C8-37" class="fnanchor">C8-37</a></p>

<p>In the absence of more specific instructions, other Federal agencies
interpreted the Secret Service’s informal requests to relate principally
to overt threats to harm the President or other specific manifestations
of hostility. For example, at the time of the assassination, the FBI<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
Handbook, which is in the possession of every Bureau special agent,
provided:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Threats against the President of the U.S., members of his immediate
family, the President-elect, and the Vice-President</p>

<p>Investigation of threats against the President of the United
States, members of his immediate family, the President-Elect, and
the Vice-President is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S.
Secret Service. Any information indicating the possibility of an
attempt against the person or safety of the President, members
of the immediate family of the President, the President-Elect or
the Vice-President must be referred immediately by the most
expeditious means of communication to the nearest office of the
U.S. Secret Service. Advise the Bureau at the same time by
teletype of the information so furnished to the Secret Service
and the fact that it has been so disseminated. The above action
should be taken without delay in order to attempt to verify the
information and no evaluation of the information should be attempted.
When the threat is in the form of a written communication,
give a copy to local Secret Service and forward the original
to the Bureau where it will be made available to Secret Service
headquarters in Washington. The referral of the copy to local
Secret Service should not delay the immediate referral of the
information by the fastest available means of communication to
Secret Service locally.<a id="FNanchor_C8-38" href="#Footnote_C8-38" class="fnanchor">C8-38</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The State Department advised the Secret Service of all crank and
threat letter mail or crank visitors and furnished reports concerning
any assassination or attempted assassination of a ruler or other major
official anywhere in the world.<a id="FNanchor_C8-39" href="#Footnote_C8-39" class="fnanchor">C8-39</a> The several military intelligence
agencies reported crank mail and similar threats involving the President.<a id="FNanchor_C8-40" href="#Footnote_C8-40" class="fnanchor">C8-40</a>
According to Special Agent in Charge Bouck, the Secret
Service had no standard procedure for the systematic review of its
requests for and receipt of information from other Federal agencies.<a id="FNanchor_C8-41" href="#Footnote_C8-41" class="fnanchor">C8-41</a></p>

<p>The Commission believes that the facilities and procedures of the
Protective Research Section of the Secret Service prior to November
22, 1963, were inadequate. Its efforts appear to have been too largely
directed at the “crank” threat. Although the Service recognized
that its advance preventive measures must encompass more than
these most obvious dangers, it made little effort to identify factors in
the activities of an individual or an organized group, other than specific
threats, which suggested a source of danger against which timely precautions
could be taken. Except for its special “trip index” file of
400 names, none of the cases in the PRS general files was available for
systematic review on a geographic basis when the President planned a
particular trip.</p>

<p>As reported in chapter II, when the special file was reviewed on
November 8, it contained the names of no persons from the entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
Dallas-Fort Worth area, notwithstanding the fact that Ambassador
Stevenson had been abused by pickets in Dallas less than a month
before. Bouck explained the failure to try to identify the individuals
involved in the Stevenson incident after it occurred on the ground
that PRS required a more direct indication of a threat to the President,
and that there was no such indication until the President’s scheduled
visit to that area became known.<a id="FNanchor_C8-42" href="#Footnote_C8-42" class="fnanchor">C8-42</a> Such an approach seriously undermines
the precautionary nature of PRS work; if the presence in Dallas
of the Stevenson pickets might have created a danger for the President
on a visit to that city, PRS should have investigated and been prepared
to guard against it.</p>

<p>Other agencies occasionally provided information to the Secret Service
concerning potentially dangerous political groups. This was
done in the case of the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, for
example, but only after members of the group had resorted to
political violence.<a id="FNanchor_C8-43" href="#Footnote_C8-43" class="fnanchor">C8-43</a> However, the vague requests for information
which the Secret Service made to Federal intelligence and law enforcement
agencies were not well designed to elicit information from
them about persons other than those who were obvious threats to
the President. The requests shifted the responsibility for evaluating
difficult cases from the Service, the agency most responsible
for performing that task, to the other agencies. No specific
guidance was provided. Although the CIA had on file requests from
the Treasury Department for information on the counterfeiting of
U.S. currency and certain smuggling matters,<a id="FNanchor_C8-44" href="#Footnote_C8-44" class="fnanchor">C8-44</a> it had no written
specification of intelligence information collected by CIA abroad which
was desired by the Secret Service in advance of Presidential trips outside
the United States.</p>

<p><i>Information known about Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination.</i>—No
information concerning Lee Harvey Oswald appeared
in PRS files before the President’s trip to Dallas. Oswald
was known to other Federal agencies with which the Secret Service
maintained intelligence liaison. The FBI had been interested in him,
to some degree at least, since the time of his defection in October 1959.
It had interviewed him twice shortly after his return to the United
States, again a year later at his request and was investigating him at
the time of the assassination. The Commission has taken the testimony
of Bureau agents who interviewed Oswald after his return from
the Soviet Union and prior to November 22, 1963, the agent who was
assigned his case at the time of the assassination, the Director of the
FBI, and the Assistant to the Director in charge of all investigative
activities under the Director and Associate Director.<a id="FNanchor_C8-45" href="#Footnote_C8-45" class="fnanchor">C8-45</a> In addition,
the Director and Deputy Director for Plans of the CIA testified concerning
that Agency’s limited knowledge of Oswald before the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C8-46" href="#Footnote_C8-46" class="fnanchor">C8-46</a>
Finally, the Commission has reviewed the complete files
on Oswald, as they existed at the time of the assassination, of the Department
of State, the Office of Naval Intelligence, the FBI, and the
CIA. The information known to the FBI is summarized below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
<i>From defection to return to Fort Worth.</i>—The FBI opened a file
on Oswald in October 1959,<a id="FNanchor_C8-47" href="#Footnote_C8-47" class="fnanchor">C8-47</a> when news reports appeared of his defection
to the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_C8-48" href="#Footnote_C8-48" class="fnanchor">C8-48</a> The file was opened “for the purpose of
correlating information inasmuch as he was considered a possible
security risk in the event he returned to this country.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-49" href="#Footnote_C8-49" class="fnanchor">C8-49</a> Oswald’s
defection was also the occasion for the opening of files by the Department
of State, CIA, and the Office of Naval Intelligence. Until
April 1960, FBI activity consisted of placing in Oswald’s file information
regarding his relations with the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
and background data relating largely to his prior military service,
provided by other agencies. In April 1960, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald
and Robert Oswald were interviewed in the course of a routine FBI
investigation of transfers of small sums of money from Mrs. Oswald to
her son in Russia.<a id="FNanchor_C8-50" href="#Footnote_C8-50" class="fnanchor">C8-50</a></p>

<p>During the next 2 years the FBI continued to accumulate information,
and kept itself informed on Oswald’s status by periodic reviews
of State Department and Office of Naval Intelligence files. In
this way, it learned that when Oswald had arrived in the Soviet
Union he had attempted to renounce his U.S. citizenship and applied
for Soviet citizenship, had described himself as a Marxist, had said
he would give the Soviet Union any useful information he had acquired
as a marine radar technician and had displayed an arrogant
and aggressive attitude at the U.S. Embassy; it learned also that
Oswald had been discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve as undesirable
in August 1960.<a id="FNanchor_C8-51" href="#Footnote_C8-51" class="fnanchor">C8-51</a> In June 1962, the Bureau was advised
by the Department of State of Oswald’s plan to return to the United
States. The Bureau made arrangements to be advised by immigration
authorities of his return, and instructed the Dallas office to interview
him when he got back to determine whether he had been recruited
by a Soviet intelligence service.<a id="FNanchor_C8-52" href="#Footnote_C8-52" class="fnanchor">C8-52</a> Oswald’s file at the Department
of State Passport Office was reviewed in June 1962. It revealed
his letter of January 30, 1962, to Secretary of the Navy Connally, in
which he protested his discharge and declared that he would use “all
means” to correct it. The file reflected the Department’s determination
that Oswald had not expatriated himself.<a id="FNanchor_C8-53" href="#Footnote_C8-53" class="fnanchor">C8-53</a></p>

<p><i>From return to Fort Worth to move to New Orleans.</i>—Oswald was
first interviewed by FBI Agents John W. Fain and B. Tom Carter
on June 26, 1962, in Fort Worth.<a id="FNanchor_C8-54" href="#Footnote_C8-54" class="fnanchor">C8-54</a> Agent Fain reported to headquarters
that Oswald was impatient and arrogant, and unwilling to
answer questions regarding his motive for going to the Soviet Union.
Oswald “denied that he had ever denounced his U.S. citizenship, and
* * * that he had ever applied for Soviet citizenship specifically.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-55" href="#Footnote_C8-55" class="fnanchor">C8-55</a>
Oswald was, however, willing to discuss his contacts with Soviet
authorities. He denied having any involvement with Soviet intelligence
agencies and promised to advise the FBI if he heard from them.<a id="FNanchor_C8-56" href="#Footnote_C8-56" class="fnanchor">C8-56</a></p>

<p>Agent Fain was not satisfied by this interview and arranged to
see Oswald again on August 16, 1962.<a id="FNanchor_C8-57" href="#Footnote_C8-57" class="fnanchor">C8-57</a> According to Fain’s contemporaneous
memorandum and his present recollection, while Oswald
remained somewhat evasive at this interview, he was not antagonistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
and seemed generally to be settling down.<a id="FNanchor_C8-58" href="#Footnote_C8-58" class="fnanchor">C8-58</a> (Marina Oswald, however,
recalled that her husband was upset by this interview.)<a id="FNanchor_C8-59" href="#Footnote_C8-59" class="fnanchor">C8-59</a>
Oswald again agreed to advise the FBI if he were approached under
suspicious circumstances; however, he deprecated the possibility of
this happening, particularly since his employment did not involve
any sensitive information.<a id="FNanchor_C8-60" href="#Footnote_C8-60" class="fnanchor">C8-60</a> Having concluded that Oswald was not
a security risk or potentially dangerous or violent, Fain determined
that nothing further remained to be done at that time and recommended
that the case be placed in a closed status.<a id="FNanchor_C8-61" href="#Footnote_C8-61" class="fnanchor">C8-61</a> This is an
administrative classification indicating that no further work has been
scheduled. It does not preclude the agent in charge of the case from
reopening it if he feels that further work should be done.<a id="FNanchor_C8-62" href="#Footnote_C8-62" class="fnanchor">C8-62</a></p>

<p>From August 1962 until March 1963, the FBI continued to accumulate
information regarding Oswald but engaged in no active investigation.
Agent Fain retired from the FBI in October 1962, and the
closed Oswald case was not reassigned.<a id="FNanchor_C8-63" href="#Footnote_C8-63" class="fnanchor">C8-63</a> However, pursuant to a
regular Bureau practice of interviewing certain immigrants from Iron
Curtain countries, Fain had been assigned to see Marina Oswald at
an appropriate time.<a id="FNanchor_C8-64" href="#Footnote_C8-64" class="fnanchor">C8-64</a> This assignment was given to Agent James
P. Hosty, Jr. of the Dallas office upon Fain’s retirement. In March
1963, while attempting to locate Marina Oswald, Agent Hosty was
told by Mrs. M. F. Tobias, a former landlady of the Oswalds at 602
Elsbeth Street in Dallas, that other tenants had complained because
Oswald was drinking to excess and beating his wife.<a id="FNanchor_C8-65" href="#Footnote_C8-65" class="fnanchor">C8-65</a> This information
led Hosty to review Oswald’s file, from which he learned that
Oswald had become a subscriber to the Worker, a Communist Party
publication. Hosty decided that the Lee Harvey Oswald case should
be reopened because of the alleged personal difficulties and the contact
with the Worker, and his recommendation was accepted.<a id="FNanchor_C8-66" href="#Footnote_C8-66" class="fnanchor">C8-66</a> He decided,
however, not to interview Marina Oswald at that time, and
merely determined that the Oswalds were living at 214 Neely Street
in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C8-67" href="#Footnote_C8-67" class="fnanchor">C8-67</a></p>

<p>On April 21, 1963, the FBI field office in New York was advised
that Oswald was in contact with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in
New York, and that he had written to the committee stating that he
had distributed its pamphlets on the streets of Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_C8-68" href="#Footnote_C8-68" class="fnanchor">C8-68</a> This information
did not reach Agent Hosty in Dallas until June.<a id="FNanchor_C8-69" href="#Footnote_C8-69" class="fnanchor">C8-69</a> Hosty considered
the information to be “stale” by that time, and did not attempt
to verify Oswald’s reported statement.<a id="FNanchor_C8-70" href="#Footnote_C8-70" class="fnanchor">C8-70</a> Under a general Bureau request
to be on the alert for activities of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee,
Hosty had inquired earlier and found no evidence that it was
functioning in the Dallas area.<a id="FNanchor_C8-71" href="#Footnote_C8-71" class="fnanchor">C8-71</a></p>

<p><i>In New Orleans.</i>—In the middle of May of 1963, Agent Hosty
checked Oswald’s last known residence and found that he had moved.<a id="FNanchor_C8-72" href="#Footnote_C8-72" class="fnanchor">C8-72</a>
Oswald was tentatively located in New Orleans in June, and Hosty
asked the New Orleans FBI office to determine Oswald’s address and
what he was doing.<a id="FNanchor_C8-73" href="#Footnote_C8-73" class="fnanchor">C8-73</a> The New Orleans office investigated and located
Oswald, learning his address and former place of employment on August
5, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C8-74" href="#Footnote_C8-74" class="fnanchor">C8-74</a> A confidential informant advised the FBI that Oswald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
was not known to be engaged in Communist Party activities in New
Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_C8-75" href="#Footnote_C8-75" class="fnanchor">C8-75</a></p>

<p>On June 24, Oswald applied in New Orleans for a passport, stating
that he planned to depart by ship for an extended tour of Western
European countries, the Soviet Union, Finland, and Poland. The
Passport Office of the Department of State in Washington had no
listing for Oswald requiring special treatment, and his application
was approved on the following day.<a id="FNanchor_C8-76" href="#Footnote_C8-76" class="fnanchor">C8-76</a> The FBI had not asked to be
informed of any effort by Oswald to obtain a passport, as it might
have under existing procedures, and did not know of his application.<a id="FNanchor_C8-77" href="#Footnote_C8-77" class="fnanchor">C8-77</a>
According to the Bureau,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We did not request the State Department to include Oswald
on a list which would have resulted in advising us of any application
for a passport inasmuch as the facts relating to Oswald’s
activities at that time did not warrant such action. Our investigation
of Oswald had disclosed no evidence that Oswald was
acting under the instructions or on behalf of any foreign government
or instrumentality thereof.<a id="FNanchor_C8-78" href="#Footnote_C8-78" class="fnanchor">C8-78</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On August 9, 1963, Oswald was arrested and jailed by the New
Orleans Police Department for disturbing the peace, in connection
with a street fight which broke out when he was accosted by anti-Castro
Cubans while distributing leaflets on behalf of the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee. On the next day, he asked the New Orleans
police to arrange for him to be interviewed by the FBI. The police
called the local FBI office and an agent, John L. Quigley, was sent
to the police station.<a id="FNanchor_C8-79" href="#Footnote_C8-79" class="fnanchor">C8-79</a> Agent Quigley did not know of Oswald’s prior
FBI record when he interviewed him, inasmuch as the police had not
given Oswald’s name to the Bureau when they called the office.<a id="FNanchor_C8-80" href="#Footnote_C8-80" class="fnanchor">C8-80</a></p>

<p>Quigley recalled that Oswald was receptive when questioned about
his general background but less than completely truthful or cooperative
when interrogated about the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
Quigley testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When I began asking him specific details with respect to his
activities in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans
as to where meetings were held, who was involved, what occurred,
he was reticent to furnish information, reluctant and actually
as far as I was concerned, was completely evasive on them.<a id="FNanchor_C8-81" href="#Footnote_C8-81" class="fnanchor">C8-81</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In Quigley’s judgment, Oswald “was probably making a self-serving
statement in attempting to explain to me why he was distributing
this literature, and for no other reason, and when I got to questioning
him further then he felt that his purpose had been served and he
wouldn’t say anything further.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-82" href="#Footnote_C8-82" class="fnanchor">C8-82</a></p>

<p>During the interview Quigley obtained background information
from Oswald which was inconsistent with information already in the
Bureau’s possession. When Quigley returned to his office, he learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
that another Bureau agent, Milton R. Kaack, had been conducting a
background investigation of Oswald at the request of Agent Hosty
in Dallas. Quigley advised Kaack of his interview and gave him a
detailed memorandum.<a id="FNanchor_C8-83" href="#Footnote_C8-83" class="fnanchor">C8-83</a> Kaack was aware of the facts known to
the FBI and recognized Oswald’s false statements.<a id="FNanchor_C8-84" href="#Footnote_C8-84" class="fnanchor">C8-84</a> For example,
Oswald claimed that his wife’s maiden name was Prossa and that they
had been married in Fort Worth and lived there until coming to
New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_C8-85" href="#Footnote_C8-85" class="fnanchor">C8-85</a> He had told the New Orleans arresting officers that
he had been born in Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_C8-86" href="#Footnote_C8-86" class="fnanchor">C8-86</a></p>

<p>Several days later, the Bureau received additional evidence that
Oswald had lied to Agent Quigley. On August 22, it learned that
Oswald had appeared on a radio discussion program on August 21.<a id="FNanchor_C8-87" href="#Footnote_C8-87" class="fnanchor">C8-87</a>
William Stuckey, who had appeared on the radio program with
Oswald, told the Bureau on August 30 that Oswald had told him that
he had worked and been married in the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_C8-88" href="#Footnote_C8-88" class="fnanchor">C8-88</a> Neither these
discrepancies nor the fact that Oswald had initiated the FBI interview
was considered sufficiently unusual to necessitate another interview.<a id="FNanchor_C8-89" href="#Footnote_C8-89" class="fnanchor">C8-89</a>
Alan H. Belmont, Assistant to the Director of the FBI, stated the Bureau’s
reasoning in this way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Our interest in this man at this point was to determine whether
his activities constituted a threat to the internal security of the
country. It was apparent that he had made a self-serving statement
to Agent Quigley. It became a matter of record in our files
as a part of the case, and if we determined that the course of the
investigation required us to clarify or face him down with this
information, we would do it at the appropriate time.</p>

<p>In other words, he committed no violation of the law by telling
us something that wasn’t true, and unless this required further
investigation at that time, we would handle it in due course, in
accord with the whole context of the investigation.<a id="FNanchor_C8-90" href="#Footnote_C8-90" class="fnanchor">C8-90</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">On August 21, 1963, Bureau headquarters instructed the New Orleans
and Dallas field offices to conduct an additional investigation of Oswald
in view of the activities which had led to his arrest.<a id="FNanchor_C8-91" href="#Footnote_C8-91" class="fnanchor">C8-91</a> FBI informants
in the New Orleans area, familiar with pro-Castro or Communist
Party activity there, advised the Bureau that Oswald was unknown in
such circles.<a id="FNanchor_C8-92" href="#Footnote_C8-92" class="fnanchor">C8-92</a></p>

<p><i>In Dallas.</i>—In early September 1963 the FBI transferred the principal
responsibility for the Oswald case from the Dallas office to the
New Orleans office.<a id="FNanchor_C8-93" href="#Footnote_C8-93" class="fnanchor">C8-93</a> Soon after, on October 1, 1963, the FBI was
advised by the rental agent for the Oswalds’ apartment in New Orleans
that they had moved again.<a id="FNanchor_C8-94" href="#Footnote_C8-94" class="fnanchor">C8-94</a> According to the information received
by the Bureau they had vacated their apartment, and Marina Oswald
had departed with their child in a station wagon with Texas registration.<a id="FNanchor_C8-95" href="#Footnote_C8-95" class="fnanchor">C8-95</a>
On October 3, Hosty reopened the case in Dallas to assist the
New Orleans office.<a id="FNanchor_C8-96" href="#Footnote_C8-96" class="fnanchor">C8-96</a> He checked in Oswald’s old neighborhood and
throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area but was unable to locate
Oswald.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span><a id="FNanchor_C8-97" href="#Footnote_C8-97" class="fnanchor">C8-97</a></p>

<p>The next word about Oswald’s location was a communication from
the CIA to the FBI on October 10, advising that an individual tentatively
identified as Oswald had been in touch with the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City in early October of 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C8-98" href="#Footnote_C8-98" class="fnanchor">C8-98</a> The Bureau had had no
earlier information suggesting that Oswald had left the United States.
The possible contact with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico intensified
the FBI’s interest in learning Oswald’s whereabouts.<a id="FNanchor_C8-99" href="#Footnote_C8-99" class="fnanchor">C8-99</a> The FBI
representative in Mexico City arranged to follow up this information
with the CIA and to verify Oswald’s entry into Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_C8-100" href="#Footnote_C8-100" class="fnanchor">C8-100</a> The CIA
message was sent also to the Department of State where it was reviewed
by personnel of the Passport Office, who knew from Oswald’s
file that he had sought and obtained a passport on June 25, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_C8-101" href="#Footnote_C8-101" class="fnanchor">C8-101</a>
The Department of State did not advise either the CIA or the FBI
of these facts.<a id="FNanchor_C8-102" href="#Footnote_C8-102" class="fnanchor">C8-102</a></p>

<p>On October 25, the New Orleans office of the FBI learned that
in September Oswald had given a forwarding address of 2515 West
Fifth Street, Irving, Tex.<a id="FNanchor_C8-103" href="#Footnote_C8-103" class="fnanchor">C8-103</a> After receiving this information on
October 29, Agent Hosty attempted to locate Oswald. On the same
day Hosty interviewed neighbors on Fifth Street and learned that
the address was that of Mrs. Ruth Paine.<a id="FNanchor_C8-104" href="#Footnote_C8-104" class="fnanchor">C8-104</a> He conducted a limited
background investigation of the Paines, intending to interview Mrs.
Paine and ask her particularly about Oswald’s whereabouts.<a id="FNanchor_C8-105" href="#Footnote_C8-105" class="fnanchor">C8-105</a></p>

<p>Having determined that Mrs. Paine was a responsible and reliable
citizen, Hosty interviewed her on November 1. The interview lasted
about 20-25 minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C8-106" href="#Footnote_C8-106" class="fnanchor">C8-106</a> In response to Hosty’s inquiries, Mrs. Paine</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * readily admitted that Mrs. Marina Oswald and Lee
Oswald’s two children were staying with her. She said that Lee
Oswald was living somewhere in Dallas. She didn’t know where.
She said it was in the Oak Cliff area but she didn’t have his
address.</p>

<p>I asked her if she knew where he worked. After a moment’s
hesitation, she told me that he worked at the Texas School Book
Depository near the downtown area of Dallas. She didn’t have
the exact address, and it is my recollection that we went to the
phone book and looked it up, found it to be 411 Elm Street.<a id="FNanchor_C8-107" href="#Footnote_C8-107" class="fnanchor">C8-107</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Mrs. Paine told Hosty also that Oswald was living alone in Dallas
because she did not want him staying at her house, although she was
willing to let Oswald visit his wife and children.<a id="FNanchor_C8-108" href="#Footnote_C8-108" class="fnanchor">C8-108</a> According to
Hosty, Mrs. Paine indicated that she thought she could find out where
Oswald was living and would let him know.<a id="FNanchor_C8-109" href="#Footnote_C8-109" class="fnanchor">C8-109</a> At this point in the
interview, Hosty gave Mrs. Paine his name and office telephone number
on a piece of paper.<a id="FNanchor_C8-110" href="#Footnote_C8-110" class="fnanchor">C8-110</a> At the end of the interview, Marina
Oswald came into the room. When he observed that she seemed
“quite alarmed” about the visit, Hosty assured her, through Mrs.
Paine as interpreter, that the FBI would not harm or harass her.<a id="FNanchor_C8-111" href="#Footnote_C8-111" class="fnanchor">C8-111</a></p>

<p>On November 4, Hosty telephoned the Texas School Book Depository
and learned that Oswald was working there and that he had given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
as his address Mrs. Paine’s residence in Irving.<a id="FNanchor_C8-112" href="#Footnote_C8-112" class="fnanchor">C8-112</a> Hosty took the
necessary steps to have the Dallas office of the FBI, rather than
the New Orleans office, reestablished as the office with principal responsibility.<a id="FNanchor_C8-113" href="#Footnote_C8-113" class="fnanchor">C8-113</a>
On November 5, Hosty was traveling near Mrs.
Paine’s home and took the occasion to stop by to ask whether she
had any further information. Mrs. Paine had nothing to add to what
she had already told him, except that during a visit that past weekend,
Oswald had said that he was a “Trotskyite Communist,” and that
she found this and similar statements illogical and somewhat amusing.<a id="FNanchor_C8-114" href="#Footnote_C8-114" class="fnanchor">C8-114</a>
On this occasion Hosty was at the Paine residence for only
a few minutes.<a id="FNanchor_C8-115" href="#Footnote_C8-115" class="fnanchor">C8-115</a></p>

<p>During neither interview did Hosty learn Oswald’s address or
telephone number in Dallas. Mrs. Paine testified that she learned
Oswald’s telephone number at the Beckley Street roominghouse
in the middle of October shortly after Oswald rented the room on
October 14. As discussed in chapter VI, she failed to report this to
Agent Hosty because she thought the FBI was in possession of a great
deal of information and certainly would find it very easy to learn
where Oswald was living.<a id="FNanchor_C8-116" href="#Footnote_C8-116" class="fnanchor">C8-116</a></p>

<p>Hosty did nothing further in connection with the Oswald case until
after the assassination. On November 1, 1963, he had received a copy
of the report of the New Orleans office which contained Agent Quigley’s
memorandum of the interview in the New Orleans jail on August
10,<a id="FNanchor_C8-117" href="#Footnote_C8-117" class="fnanchor">C8-117</a> and realized immediately that Oswald had given false biographic
information.<a id="FNanchor_C8-118" href="#Footnote_C8-118" class="fnanchor">C8-118</a> Hosty knew that he would eventually have to investigate
this, and “was quite interested in determining the nature of his
contact with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-119" href="#Footnote_C8-119" class="fnanchor">C8-119</a> When asked
what his next step would have been, Hosty replied:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, as I had previously stated, I have between 25 and 40 cases
assigned to me at any one time. I had other matters to take care
of. I had now established that Lee Oswald was not employed in
a sensitive industry. I can now afford to wait until New Orleans
forwarded the necessary papers to me to show me I now had all
the information. It was then my plan to interview Marina
Oswald in detail concerning both herself and her husband’s
background.</p>

<p>Q. Had you planned any steps beyond that point?</p>

<p>A. No. I would have to wait until I had talked to Marina to
see what I could determine, and from there I could make my plans.</p>

<p>Q. Did you take any action on this case between November 5
and November 22?</p>

<p>A. No, sir.<a id="FNanchor_C8-120" href="#Footnote_C8-120" class="fnanchor">C8-120</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The official Bureau files confirm Hosty’s statement that from November
5 until the assassination, no active investigation was conducted.<a id="FNanchor_C8-121" href="#Footnote_C8-121" class="fnanchor">C8-121</a>
On November 18 the FBI learned that Oswald recently
had been in communication with the Soviet Embassy in Washington
and so advised the Dallas office in the ordinary course of business.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
Hosty received this information on the afternoon of November 22,
1963.<a id="FNanchor_C8-122" href="#Footnote_C8-122" class="fnanchor">C8-122</a></p>

<p><i>Nonreferral of Oswald to the Secret Service.</i>—The Commission has
considered carefully the question whether the FBI, in view of all
the information concerning Oswald in its files, should have alerted
the Secret Service to Oswald’s presence in Dallas prior to President
Kennedy’s visit. The Secret Service and the FBI differ as to whether
Oswald fell within the category of “threats against the President”
which should be referred to the Service.</p>

<p>Robert I. Bouck, special agent in charge of the Protective Research
Section, testified that the information available to the Federal Government
about Oswald before the assassination would, if known to
PRS, have made Oswald a subject of concern to the Secret Service.<a id="FNanchor_C8-123" href="#Footnote_C8-123" class="fnanchor">C8-123</a>
Bouck pointed to a number of characteristics besides Oswald’s defection
the cumulative effect of which would have been to alert the
Secret Service to potential danger:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I would think his continued association with the Russian Embassy
after his return, his association with the Castro groups would
have been of concern to us, a knowledge that he had, I believe,
been courtmartialed for illegal possession of a gun, of a hand
gun in the Marines, that he had owned a weapon and did a good
deal of hunting or use of it, perhaps in Russia, plus a number of
items about his disposition and unreliability of character, I think
all of those, if we had had them altogether, would have added up
to pointing out a pretty bad individual, and I think that, together,
had we known that he had a vantage point would have seemed
somewhat serious to us, even though I must admit that none of
these in themselves would be—would meet our specific criteria,
none of them alone.</p>

<p>But it is when you begin adding them up to some degree that
you begin to get criteria that are meaningful.<a id="FNanchor_C8-124" href="#Footnote_C8-124" class="fnanchor">C8-124</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Mr. Bouck pointed out, however, that he had no reason to believe that
any one Federal agency had access to all this information, including
the significant fact that Oswald was employed in a building which
overlooked the motorcade route.<a id="FNanchor_C8-125" href="#Footnote_C8-125" class="fnanchor">C8-125</a></p>

<p>Agent Hosty testified that he was fully aware of the pending Presidential
visit to Dallas. He recalled that the special agent in charge
of the Dallas office of the FBI, J. Gordon Shanklin, had discussed the
President’s visit on several occasions, including the regular biweekly
conference on the morning of November 22:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Shanklin advised us, among other things, that in view of
the President’s visit to Dallas, that if anyone had any indication
of any possibility of any acts of violence or any demonstrations
against the President, or Vice President, to immediately notify
the Secret Service and confirm it in writing. He had made the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
same statement about a week prior at another special conference
which we had held. I don’t recall the exact date. It was about
a week prior.<a id="FNanchor_C8-126" href="#Footnote_C8-126" class="fnanchor">C8-126</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In fact, Hosty participated in transmitting to the Secret Service two
pieces of information pertaining to the visit.<a id="FNanchor_C8-127" href="#Footnote_C8-127" class="fnanchor">C8-127</a> Hosty testified that he
did not know until the evening of Thursday, November 21, that there
was to be a motorcade, however, and never realized that the motorcade
would pass the Texas School Book Depository Building. He testified
that he did not read the newspaper story describing the motorcade
route in detail, since he was interested only in the fact that the motorcade
was coming up Main Street, “where maybe I could watch it if I
had a chance.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-128" href="#Footnote_C8-128" class="fnanchor">C8-128</a></p>

<p>Even if he had recalled that Oswald’s place of employment was on
the President’s route, Hosty testified that he would not have cited
him to the Secret Service as a potential threat to the President.<a id="FNanchor_C8-129" href="#Footnote_C8-129" class="fnanchor">C8-129</a>
Hosty interpreted his instructions as requiring “some indication that
the person planned to take some action against the safety of the President
of the United States or the Vice President.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-130" href="#Footnote_C8-130" class="fnanchor">C8-130</a> In his opinion,
none of the information in the FBI files—Oswald’s defection, his Fair
Play for Cuba activities in New Orleans, his lies to Agent Quigley, his
recent visit to Mexico City—indicated that Oswald was capable of
violence.<a id="FNanchor_C8-131" href="#Footnote_C8-131" class="fnanchor">C8-131</a> Hosty’s initial reaction on hearing that Oswald was a
suspect in the assassination, was “shock, complete surprise,” because
he had no reason to believe that Oswald “was capable or potentially
an assassin of the President of the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-132" href="#Footnote_C8-132" class="fnanchor">C8-132</a></p>

<p>Shortly after Oswald was apprehended and identified, Hosty’s
superior sent him to observe the interrogation of Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_C8-133" href="#Footnote_C8-133" class="fnanchor">C8-133</a> Hosty
parked his car in the basement of police headquarters and there met
an acquaintance, Lt. Jack Revill of the Dallas police force. The
two men disagree about the conversation which took place between
them. They agree that Hosty told Revill that the FBI had known
about Oswald and, in particular, of his presence in Dallas and his
employment at the Texas School Book Depository Building.<a id="FNanchor_C8-134" href="#Footnote_C8-134" class="fnanchor">C8-134</a> Revill
testified that Hosty said also that the FBI had information that
Oswald was “capable of committing this assassination.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-135" href="#Footnote_C8-135" class="fnanchor">C8-135</a> According
to Revill, Hosty indicated that he was going to tell this to Lieutenant
Wells of the homicide and robbery bureau.<a id="FNanchor_C8-136" href="#Footnote_C8-136" class="fnanchor">C8-136</a> Revill promptly
made a memorandum of this conversation in which the quoted statement
appears.<a id="FNanchor_C8-137" href="#Footnote_C8-137" class="fnanchor">C8-137</a> His secretary testified that she prepared such a
report for him that afternoon<a id="FNanchor_C8-138" href="#Footnote_C8-138" class="fnanchor">C8-138</a> and Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry
and District Attorney Henry M. Wade both testified that they saw it
later that day.<a id="FNanchor_C8-139" href="#Footnote_C8-139" class="fnanchor">C8-139</a></p>

<p>Hosty has unequivocally denied, first by affidavit and then in his
testimony before the Commission, that he ever said that Oswald was
capable of violence, or that he had any information suggesting this.<a id="FNanchor_C8-140" href="#Footnote_C8-140" class="fnanchor">C8-140</a>
The only witness to the conversation was Dallas Police Detective V. J.
Brian, who was accompanying Revill. Brian did not hear Hosty
make any statement concerning Oswald’s capacity to be an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
assassin but he did not hear the entire conversation because
of the commotion at police headquarters and because he was not
within hearing distance at all times.<a id="FNanchor_C8-141" href="#Footnote_C8-141" class="fnanchor">C8-141</a></p>

<p>Hosty’s interpretation of the prevailing FBI instructions on referrals
to the Secret Service was defended before the Commission by
his superiors. After summarizing the Bureau’s investigative interest
in Oswald prior to the assassination, J. Edgar Hoover concluded
that “There was nothing up to the time of the assassination that gave
any indication that this man was a dangerous character who might do
harm to the President or to the Vice President.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-142" href="#Footnote_C8-142" class="fnanchor">C8-142</a> Director Hoover
emphasized that the first indication of Oswald’s capacity for violence
was his attempt on General Walker’s life, which did not become
known to the FBI until after the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_C8-143" href="#Footnote_C8-143" class="fnanchor">C8-143</a> Both Director
Hoover and his assistant, Alan H. Belmont, stressed also the decision
by the Department of State that Oswald should be permitted
to return to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_C8-144" href="#Footnote_C8-144" class="fnanchor">C8-144</a> Neither believed that the Bureau
investigation of him up to November 22 revealed any information
which would have justified referral to the Secret Service. According
to Belmont, when Oswald returned from the Soviet Union,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * he indicated that he had learned his lesson, was disenchanted
with Russia, and had a renewed concept—I am paraphrasing,
a renewed concept—of the American free society.</p>

<p>We talked to him twice. He likewise indicated he was disenchanted
with Russia. We satisfied ourselves that we had met
our requirement, namely to find out whether he had been recruited
by Soviet intelligence. The case was closed.</p>

<p>We again exhibited interest on the basis of these contacts with
The Worker, Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which are relatively
inconsequential.</p>

<p>His activities for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New
Orleans, we knew, were not of real consequence as he was not connected
with any organized activity there.</p>

<p>The interview with him in jail is not significant from the standpoint
of whether he had a propensity for violence.</p>

<p>Q. This is the Quigley interview you are talking about?</p>

<p>A. Yes; it was a self-serving interview.</p>

<p>The visits with the Soviet Embassy were evidently for the purpose
of securing a visa, and he had told us during one of the interviews
that he would probably take his wife back to Soviet Russia
some time in the future. He had come back to Dallas. Hosty
had established that he had a job, he was working, and had told
Mrs. Paine that when he got the money he was going to take an
apartment when the baby was old enough, he was going to take
an apartment, and the family would live together.</p>

<p>He gave evidence of settling down. Nowhere during the course
of this investigation or the information that came to us from other
agencies was there any indication of a potential for violence on
his part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
Consequently, there was no basis for Hosty to go to Secret Service
and advise them of Oswald’s presence. * * *<a id="FNanchor_C8-145" href="#Footnote_C8-145" class="fnanchor">C8-145</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As reflected in this testimony, the officials of the FBI believed that
there was no data in its files which gave warning that Oswald was a
source of danger to President Kennedy. While he had expressed
hostility at times toward the State Department, the Marine Corps, and
the FBI as agents of the Government,<a id="FNanchor_C8-146" href="#Footnote_C8-146" class="fnanchor">C8-146</a> so far as the FBI knew he
had not shown any potential for violence. Prior to November 22,
1963, no law enforcement agency had any information to connect
Oswald with the attempted shooting of General Walker. It was
against this background and consistent with the criteria followed by
the FBI prior to November 22 that agents of the FBI in Dallas did not
consider Oswald’s presence in the Texas School Book Depository
Building overlooking the motorcade route as a source of danger to the
President and did not inform the Secret Service of his employment
in the Depository Building.</p>

<p>The Commission believes, however, that the FBI took an unduly
restrictive view of its responsibilities in preventive intelligence work,
prior to the assassination. The Commission appreciates the large
volume of cases handled by the FBI (636,371 investigative matters
during fiscal year 1963).<a id="FNanchor_C8-147" href="#Footnote_C8-147" class="fnanchor">C8-147</a> There were no Secret Service criteria
which specifically required the referral of Oswald’s case to the Secret
Service; nor was there any requirement to report the names of defectors.
However, there was much material in the hands of the FBI
about Oswald: the knowledge of his defection, his arrogance and
hostility to the United States, his pro-Castro tendencies, his lies when
interrogated by the FBI, his trip to Mexico where he was in contact
with Soviet authorities, his presence in the School Book Depository job
and its location along the route of the motorcade. All this does seem
to amount to enough to have induced an alert agency, such as the FBI,
possessed of this information to list Oswald as a potential threat to
the safety of the President. This conclusion may be tinged with
hindsight, but it stated primarily to direct the thought of those responsible
for the future safety of our Presidents to the need for a more
imaginative and less narrow interpretation of their responsibilities.</p>

<p>It is the conclusion of the Commission that, even in the absence
of Secret Service criteria which specifically required the referral of
such a case as Oswald’s to the Secret Service, a more alert and carefully
considered treatment of the Oswald case by the Bureau might
have brought about such a referral. Had such a review been undertaken
by the FBI, there might conceivably have been additional investigation
of the Oswald case between November 5 and November
22. Agent Hosty testified that several matters brought to his attention
in late October and early November, including the visit to the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, required further attention. Under
proper procedures knowledge of the pending Presidential visit might
have prompted Hosty to have made more vigorous efforts to locate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
Oswald’s roominghouse address in Dallas and to interview him regarding
these unresolved matters.</p>

<p>The formal FBI instructions to its agents outlining the information
to be referred to the Secret Service were too narrow at the time
of the assassination. While the Secret Service bears the principal
responsibility for this failure, the FBI instructions did not reflect
fully the Secret Service’s need for information regarding potential
threats. The handbook referred thus to “the possibility of
an attempt against the person or safety of the President.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-148" href="#Footnote_C8-148" class="fnanchor">C8-148</a> It is
clear from Hosty’s testimony that this was construed, at least by him,
as requiring evidence of a plan or conspiracy to injure the President.<a id="FNanchor_C8-149" href="#Footnote_C8-149" class="fnanchor">C8-149</a>
Efforts made by the Bureau since the assassination, on the other hand,
reflect keen awareness of the necessity of communicating a much wider
range of intelligence information to the Service.<a id="FNanchor_C8-150" href="#Footnote_C8-150" class="fnanchor">C8-150</a></p>

<p>Most important, notwithstanding that both agencies have professed
to the Commission that the liaison between them was close and fully
sufficient,<a id="FNanchor_C8-151" href="#Footnote_C8-151" class="fnanchor">C8-151</a> the Commission does not believe that the liaison between
the FBI and the Secret Service prior to the assassination was as
effective as it should have been. The FBI Manual of Instructions
provided:</p>

<blockquote>

<h4 id="hdr159">Liaison With Other Government Agencies</h4>

<p>To insure adequate and effective liaison arrangements, each
SAC should specifically designate an Agent (or Agents) to be
responsible for developing and maintaining liaison with other
Federal Agencies. This liaison should take into consideration
FBI-agency community of interests, location of agency headquarters,
and the responsiveness of agency representatives. In
each instance, liaison contacts should be developed to include
a close friendly relationship, mutual understanding of FBI and
agency jurisdictions, and an indicated willingness by the agency
representative to coordinate activities and to discuss problems
of mutual interest. Each field office should determine those
Federal agencies which are represented locally and with which
liaison should be conducted.<a id="FNanchor_C8-152" href="#Footnote_C8-152" class="fnanchor">C8-152</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The testimony reveals that liaison responsibilities in connection with
the President’s visit were discussed twice officially by the special agent
in charge of the FBI office in Dallas. As discussed in chapter II,
some limited information was made available to the Secret Service.<a id="FNanchor_C8-153" href="#Footnote_C8-153" class="fnanchor">C8-153</a>
But there was no fully adequate liaison between the two agencies.
Indeed, the Commission believes that the liaison between all Federal
agencies responsible for Presidential protection should be improved.</p>

<h4 id="hdr160">Other Protective Measures and Aspects of Secret Service
Performance</h4>

<p>The President’s trip to Dallas called into play many standard operating
procedures of the Secret Service in addition to its preventive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
intelligence operations. Examination of these procedures shows that
in most respects they were well conceived and ably executed by the
personnel of the Service. Against the background of the critical
events of November 22, however, certain shortcomings and lapses from
the high standards which the Commission believes should prevail in
the field of Presidential protection are evident.</p>

<p><i>Advance preparations.</i>—The advance preparations in Dallas by
Agent Winston G. Lawson of the White House detail have been described
in chapter II. With the assistance of Agent in Charge Sorrels
of the Dallas field office of the Secret Service, Lawson was responsible
for working out a great many arrangements for the President’s trip.
The Service prefers to have two agents perform advance preparations.
In the case of Dallas, because President Kennedy had scheduled visits
to five Texas cities and had also scheduled visits to other parts of the
country immediately before the Texas trip, there were not enough
men available to permit two agents to be assigned to all the advance
work. Consequently, Agent Lawson did the advance work alone from
November 13 to November 18, when he was joined by Agent David
B. Grant, who had just completed advance work on the President’s
trip to Tampa.</p>

<p>The Commission concludes that the most significant advance arrangements
for the President’s trip were soundly planned. In particular,
the Commission believes that the motorcade route selected by
Agent Lawson, upon the advice of Agent in Charge Sorrels and with
the concurrence of the Dallas police, was entirely appropriate, in
view of the known desires of the President. There were far safer
routes via freeways directly to the Trade Mart, but these routes would
not have been in accordance with the White House staff instructions
given the Secret Service for a desirable motorcade route.<a id="FNanchor_C8-154" href="#Footnote_C8-154" class="fnanchor">C8-154</a> Much of
Lawson’s time was taken with establishing adequate security over the
motorcade route and at the two places where the President would stop,
Love Field and the Trade Mart. The Commission concludes that the
arrangements worked out at the Trade Mart by these Secret Service
agents with the cooperation of the Dallas police and other local law
enforcement agents, were carefully executed. Since the President was
to be at the Trade Mart longer than at any other location in Dallas and
in view of the security hazards presented by the building, the Secret
Service correctly gave particular attention in the advance preparations
to those arrangements. The Commission also regards the security
arrangements worked out by Lawson and Sorrels at Love Field
as entirely adequate.</p>

<p>The Commission believes, however, that the Secret Service has inadequately
defined the responsibilities of its advance agents, who have
been given broad discretion to determine what matters require attention
in making advance preparations and to decide what action to
take. Agent Lawson was not given written instructions concerning
the Dallas trip or advice about any peculiar problems which it might
involve; all instructions from higher authority were communicated to
him orally. He did not have a checklist of the tasks he was expected to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
accomplish, either by his own efforts or with the cooperation of local
authorities.<a id="FNanchor_C8-155" href="#Footnote_C8-155" class="fnanchor">C8-155</a> The only systematic supervision of the activities of the
advance agent has been that provided by a requirement that he file
interim and final reports on each advance assignment. The interim
report must be in the hands of the agent supervising the protective
group traveling with the President long enough before his departure
to apprise him of any particular problems encountered and the responsive
action taken.<a id="FNanchor_C8-156" href="#Footnote_C8-156" class="fnanchor">C8-156</a> Agent Lawson’s interim report was received
by Agent Kellerman on November 20, the day before departure on the
Texas trip.<a id="FNanchor_C8-157" href="#Footnote_C8-157" class="fnanchor">C8-157</a></p>

<p>The Secret Service has advised the Commission that no unusual
precautions were taken for the Dallas trip, and that “the precautions
taken for the President’s trip were the usual safeguards employed on
trips of this kind in the United States during the previous year.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-158" href="#Footnote_C8-158" class="fnanchor">C8-158</a>
Special Agent in Charge Sorrels testified that the advance preparations
followed on this occasion were “pretty much the same” as those followed
in 1936 during a trip to Dallas by President Roosevelt, which
was Sorrels’ first important assignment in connection with Presidential
work.<a id="FNanchor_C8-159" href="#Footnote_C8-159" class="fnanchor">C8-159</a></p>

<p>In view of the constant change in the nature of threats to the President
and the diversity of the dangers which may arise in the various
cities within the United States, the Commission believes that standard
procedures in use for many years and applied in all parts of the
country may not be sufficient. There is, for example, no Secret Service
arrangement for evaluating before a trip particular difficulties that
might be anticipated, which would bring to bear the judgment and
experience of members of the White House detail other than the
advance agent. Constant reevaluation of procedures, with attention
to special problems and the development of instructions specific to
particular trips, would be a desirable innovation.</p>

<p><i>Liaison with local law enforcement authorities.</i>—In the description
of the important aspects of the advance preparations, there have been
references to the numerous discussions between Secret Service representatives
and the Dallas Police Department. The wholehearted
support of these local authorities was indispensable to the Service in
carrying out its duties. The Service had 28 agents participating in
the Dallas visit.<a id="FNanchor_C8-160" href="#Footnote_C8-160" class="fnanchor">C8-160</a> Agent Lawson’s advance planning called for the
deployment of almost 600 members of the Dallas Police Department,
Fire Department, County Sheriff’s Department, and the Texas Department
of Public Safety.<a id="FNanchor_C8-161" href="#Footnote_C8-161" class="fnanchor">C8-161</a> Despite this dependence on local authorities,
which would be substantially the same on a visit by the
President to any large city, the Secret Service did not at the time of
the assassination have any established procedure governing its relationships
with them.<a id="FNanchor_C8-162" href="#Footnote_C8-162" class="fnanchor">C8-162</a> It had no prepared checklist of matters to be
covered with local police on such visits to metropolitan areas and no
written description of the role the local police were expected to perform.
Discussions with the Dallas authorities and requests made of
them were entirely informal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
The Commission believes that a more formal statement of assigned
responsibilities, supplemented in each case to reflect the peculiar conditions
of each Presidential trip, is essential. This would help to
eliminate varying interpretations of Secret Service instructions by
different local law enforcement representatives. For example, while
the Secret Service representatives in Dallas asked the police to station
guards at each overpass to keep “unauthorized personnel” off, this
term was not defined. At some overpasses all persons were excluded,
while on the overpass overlooking the assassination scene railroad and
yard terminal workmen were permitted to remain under police supervision,
as discussed in chapter III.<a id="FNanchor_C8-163" href="#Footnote_C8-163" class="fnanchor">C8-163</a> Assistant Chief Batchelor of the
Dallas police noted the absence of any formal statement by the Secret
Service of specific work assigned to the police and suggested the
desirability of such a statement.<a id="FNanchor_C8-164" href="#Footnote_C8-164" class="fnanchor">C8-164</a> Agent Lawson agreed that such a
procedure would assist him and other agents in fulfilling their responsibilities
as advance agents.<a id="FNanchor_C8-165" href="#Footnote_C8-165" class="fnanchor">C8-165</a></p>

<p><i>Check of buildings along route of motorcade.</i>—Agent Lawson did
not arrange for a prior inspection of buildings along the motorcade
route, either by police or by custodians of the buildings, since it was
not the usual practice of the Secret Service to do so.<a id="FNanchor_C8-166" href="#Footnote_C8-166" class="fnanchor">C8-166</a> The Chief of
the Service has provided the Commission a detailed explanation of
this policy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Except for inauguration or other parades involving foreign
dignitaries accompanied by the President in Washington, it has
not been the practice of the Secret Service to make surveys or
checks of buildings along the route of a Presidential motorcade.
For the inauguration and certain other parades in Washington
where the traditional route is known to the public long in advance
of the event, buildings along the route can be checked by teams
of law enforcement officers, and armed guards are posted along
the route as appropriate. But on out-of-town trips where the
route is decided on and made public only a few days in advance,
buildings are not checked either by Secret Service agents or by
any other law enforcement officers at the request of the Secret
Service. With the number of men available to the Secret Service
and the time available, surveys of hundreds of buildings and
thousands of windows is not practical.</p>

<p>In Dallas the route selected necessarily involved passing
through the principal downtown section between tall buildings.
While certain streets thought to be too narrow could be avoided
and other choices made, it was not practical to select a route
where the President could not be seen from roofs or windows of
buildings. At the two places in Dallas where the President would
remain for a period of time, Love Field and the Trade Mart,
arrangements were made for building and roof security by posting
police officers where appropriate. Similar arrangements for
a motorcade of ten miles, including many blocks of tall commercial
buildings is not practical. Nor is it practical to prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
people from entering such buildings, or to limit access in every
building to those employed or having business there. Even if it
were possible with a vastly larger force of security officers to do
so, many observers have felt that such a procedure would not be
consistent with the nature and purpose of the motorcade to let
the people see their President and to welcome him to their city.</p>

<p>In accordance with its regular procedures, no survey or other
check was made by the Secret Service, or by any other law enforcement
agency at its request, of the Texas School Book Depository
Building or those employed there prior to the time the
President was shot.<a id="FNanchor_C8-167" href="#Footnote_C8-167" class="fnanchor">C8-167</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This justification of the Secret Service’s standing policy is not persuasive.
The danger from a concealed sniper on the Dallas trip was
of concern to those who had considered the problem. President
Kennedy himself had mentioned it that morning,<a id="FNanchor_C8-168" href="#Footnote_C8-168" class="fnanchor">C8-168</a> as had Agent
Sorrels when he and Agent Lawson were fixing the motorcade route.<a id="FNanchor_C8-169" href="#Footnote_C8-169" class="fnanchor">C8-169</a>
Admittedly, protective measures cannot ordinarily be taken with
regard to all buildings along a motorcade route. Levels of risk can be
determined, however, as has been confirmed by building surveys made
since the assassination for the Department of the Treasury.<a id="FNanchor_C8-170" href="#Footnote_C8-170" class="fnanchor">C8-170</a> An
attempt to cover only the most obvious points of possible ambush
along the route in Dallas might well have included the Texas School
Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Instead of such advance precautions, the Secret Service depended
in part on the efforts of local law enforcement personnel stationed
along the route. In addition, Secret Service agents riding in the
motorcade were trained to scan buildings as part of their general
observation of the crowd of spectators.<a id="FNanchor_C8-171" href="#Footnote_C8-171" class="fnanchor">C8-171</a> These substitute measures
were of limited value. Agent Lawson was unable to state whether
he had actually instructed the Dallas police to scan windows of buildings
lining the motorcade route, although it was his usual practice
to do so.<a id="FNanchor_C8-172" href="#Footnote_C8-172" class="fnanchor">C8-172</a> If such instructions were in fact given, they were not
effectively carried out. Television films taken of parts of the motorcade
by a Dallas television station show the foot patrolmen facing
the passing motorcade, and not the adjacent crowds and buildings,
as the procession passed.<a id="FNanchor_C8-173" href="#Footnote_C8-173" class="fnanchor">C8-173</a></p>

<p>Three officers from the Dallas Police Department were assigned to
the intersection of Elm and Houston during the morning of November
22 prior to the motorcade.<a id="FNanchor_C8-174" href="#Footnote_C8-174" class="fnanchor">C8-174</a> All received their instructions
early in the morning from Capt. P. W. Lawrence of the traffic division.<a id="FNanchor_C8-175" href="#Footnote_C8-175" class="fnanchor">C8-175</a>
According to Captain Lawrence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I then told the officers that their primary duty was traffic and
crowd control and that they should be alert for any persons who
might attempt to throw anything and although it was not a violation
of the law to carry a placard, that they were not to tolerate
any actions such as the Stevenson incident and arrest any person
who might attempt to throw anything or try to get at the President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
and his party; paying particular attention to the crowd
for any unusual activity. I stressed the fact that this was our
President and he should be shown every respect due his position
and that it was our duty to see that this was done.<a id="FNanchor_C8-176" href="#Footnote_C8-176" class="fnanchor">C8-176</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Captain Lawrence was not instructed to have his men watch buildings
along the motorcade route and did not mention the observation of
buildings to them.<a id="FNanchor_C8-177" href="#Footnote_C8-177" class="fnanchor">C8-177</a> The three officers confirm that their primary
concern was crowd and traffic control, and that they had no opportunity
to scan the windows of the Depository or any other building
in the vicinity of Elm and Houston when the motorcade was passing.
They had, however, occasionally observed the windows of buildings
in the area before the motorcade arrived, in accordance with their
own understanding of their function.<a id="FNanchor_C8-178" href="#Footnote_C8-178" class="fnanchor">C8-178</a></p>

<p>As the motorcade approached Elm Street there were several Secret
Service agents in it who shared the responsibility of scanning the
windows of nearby buildings. Agent Sorrels, riding in the lead car,
did observe the Texas School Book Depository Building as he passed
by, at least for a sufficient number of seconds to gain a “general impression”
of the lack of any unusual activity.<a id="FNanchor_C8-179" href="#Footnote_C8-179" class="fnanchor">C8-179</a> He was handicapped,
however, by the fact that he was riding in a closed car whose roof
at times obscured his view.<a id="FNanchor_C8-180" href="#Footnote_C8-180" class="fnanchor">C8-180</a> Lawson, also in the lead car, did not
scan any buildings since an important part of his job was to look
backward at the Presidents car.<a id="FNanchor_C8-181" href="#Footnote_C8-181" class="fnanchor">C8-181</a> Lawson stated that he “was looking
back a good deal of the time, watching his car, watching the sides,
watching the crowds, giving advice or asking advice from the Chief
and also looking ahead to the known hazards like overpasses, underpasses,
railroads, et cetera.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-182" href="#Footnote_C8-182" class="fnanchor">C8-182</a> Agent Roy H. Kellerman, riding in
the front seat of the Presidential car, stated that he scanned the Depository
Building, but not sufficiently to be alerted by anything in the
windows or on the roof.<a id="FNanchor_C8-183" href="#Footnote_C8-183" class="fnanchor">C8-183</a> The agents in the followup car also were
expected to scan adjacent buildings. However, the Commission does
not believe that agents stationed in a car behind the Presidential car,
who must concentrate primarily on the possibility of threats from
crowds along the route, provide a significant safeguard against dangers
in nearby buildings.</p>

<p><i>Conduct of Secret Service agents in Fort Worth on November 22.</i>—In
the early morning hours on November 22, 1963, in Fort Worth,
there occurred a breach of discipline by some members of the Secret
Service who were officially traveling with the President. After the
President had retired at his hotel, nine agents who were off duty
went to the nearby Fort Worth Press Club at midnight or slightly
thereafter, expecting to obtain food; they had had little opportunity
to eat during the day.<a id="FNanchor_C8-184" href="#Footnote_C8-184" class="fnanchor">C8-184</a> No food was available at the Press Club.
All of the agents stayed for a drink of beer, or in several cases, a mixed
drink. According to their affidavits, the drinking in no case amounted
to more than three glasses of beer or 1½ mixed drinks, and others
who were present say that no agent was inebriated or acted improperly.
The statements of the agents involved are supported by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
statements of members of the Fort Worth press who accompanied
or observed them and by a Secret Service investigation.<a id="FNanchor_C8-185" href="#Footnote_C8-185" class="fnanchor">C8-185</a></p>

<p>According to their statements, the agents remained at the Press
Club for periods varying from 30 minutes to an hour and a half, and
the last agent left the Press Club by 2 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_C8-186" href="#Footnote_C8-186" class="fnanchor">C8-186</a> Two of the nine agents
returned to their rooms. The seven others proceeded to an establishment
called the Cellar Coffee House, described by some as a beatnik
place and by its manager as “a unique show place with continuous
light entertainment all night [serving] only coffee, fruit juices and no
hard liquors or beer.” <a id="FNanchor_C8-187" href="#Footnote_C8-187" class="fnanchor">C8-187</a> There is no indication that any of the agents
who visited the Cellar Coffee House had any intoxicating drink at that
establishment.<a id="FNanchor_C8-188" href="#Footnote_C8-188" class="fnanchor">C8-188</a> Most of the agents were there from about 1:30 or
1:45 a.m. to about 2:45 or 3 a.m.; one agent was there from 2 until
5 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_C8-189" href="#Footnote_C8-189" class="fnanchor">C8-189</a></p>

<p>The lobby of the hotel and the areas adjacent to the quarters of the
President were guarded during the night by members of the midnight
to 8 a.m. shift of the White House detail. These agents were
each relieved for a half hour break during the night.<a id="FNanchor_C8-190" href="#Footnote_C8-190" class="fnanchor">C8-190</a> Three members
of this shift separately took this opportunity to visit the Cellar
Coffee House.<a id="FNanchor_C8-191" href="#Footnote_C8-191" class="fnanchor">C8-191</a> Only one stayed as long as a half hour, and none had
any beverage there.<a id="FNanchor_C8-192" href="#Footnote_C8-192" class="fnanchor">C8-192</a> Chief Rowley testified that agents on duty
in such a situation usually stay within the building during their relief,
but that their visits to the Cellar were “neither consistent nor inconsistent”
with their duty.<a id="FNanchor_C8-193" href="#Footnote_C8-193" class="fnanchor">C8-193</a></p>

<p>Each of the agents who visited the Press Club or the Cellar Coffee
House (apart from the three members of the midnight shift) had duty
assignments beginning no later than 8 a.m. that morning. President
Kennedy was scheduled to speak across the street from his hotel in
Fort Worth at 8:30 a.m.,<a id="FNanchor_C8-194" href="#Footnote_C8-194" class="fnanchor">C8-194</a> and then at a breakfast, after which the
entourage would proceed to Dallas. In Dallas, one of the nine agents
was assigned to assist in security measures at Love Field, and four had
protective assignments at the Trade Mart. The remaining four had
key responsibilities as members of the complement of the followup car
in the motorcade. Three of these agents occupied positions on the
running boards of the car, and the fourth was seated in the car.<a id="FNanchor_C8-195" href="#Footnote_C8-195" class="fnanchor">C8-195</a></p>

<p>The supervisor of each of the off-duty agents who visited the Press
Club or the Cellar Coffee House advised, in the course of the Secret
Service investigation of these events, that each agent reported for
duty on time, with full possession of his mental and physical capabilities
and entirely ready for the performance of his assigned
duties.<a id="FNanchor_C8-196" href="#Footnote_C8-196" class="fnanchor">C8-196</a> Chief Rowley testified that, as a result of the investigation
he ordered, he was satisfied that each of the agents performed his
duties in an entirely satisfactory manner, and that their conduct the
night before did not impede their actions on duty or in the slightest
way prevent them from taking any action that might have averted
the tragedy.<a id="FNanchor_C8-197" href="#Footnote_C8-197" class="fnanchor">C8-197</a> However, Chief Rowley did not condone the action
of the off-duty agents, particularly since it violated a regulation of
the Secret Service, which provides:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Liquor, use of.</i>—a. Employees are strictly enjoined to refrain
from the use of intoxicating liquor during the hours they are
officially employed at their post of duty, or when they may
reasonably expect that they may be called upon to perform an
official duty. During entire periods of travel status, the special
agent is officially employed and should not use liquor, until the
completion of all of his official duties for the day, after which
time a very moderate use of liquor will not be considered a violation.
However, all members of the White House Detail and
special agents cooperating with them on Presidential and similar
protective assignments are considered to be subject to call for
official duty at any time while in travel status. Therefore, the
use of intoxicating liquor of any kind, including beer and wine,
by members of the White House Detail and special agents cooperating
with them, or by special agents on similar assignments,
while they are in a travel status, is prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_C8-198" href="#Footnote_C8-198" class="fnanchor">C8-198</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The regulations provide further that “violation or slight disregard”
of these provisions “will be cause for removal from the Service.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-199" href="#Footnote_C8-199" class="fnanchor">C8-199</a></p>

<p>Chief Rowley testified that under ordinary circumstances he would
have taken disciplinary action against those agents who had been
drinking in clear violation of the regulation. However, he felt that
any disciplinary action might have given rise to an inference that
the violation of the regulation had contributed to the tragic events
of November 22. Since he was convinced that this was not the case,
he believed that it would be unfair to the agents and their families
to take explicit disciplinary measures. He felt that each agent recognized
the seriousness of the infraction and that there was no danger
of a repetition.<a id="FNanchor_C8-200" href="#Footnote_C8-200" class="fnanchor">C8-200</a></p>

<p>The Commission recognizes that the responsibilities of members of
the White House detail of the Secret Service are arduous. They work
long, hard hours, under very great strain, and must travel frequently.
It might seem harsh to circumscribe their opportunities for relaxation.
Yet their role of protecting the President is so important to the well-being
of the country that it is reasonable to expect them to meet very
high standards of personal conduct, so that nothing can interfere
with their bringing to their task the finest qualities and maximum
resources of mind and body. This is the salutary goal to which the
Secret Service regulation is directed, when it absolutely forbids
drinking by any agent accompanying the President on a trip. Nor
is this goal served when agents remain out until early morning hours,
and lose the opportunity to get a reasonable amount of sleep. It is
conceivable that those men who had little sleep, and who had consumed
alcoholic beverages, even in limited quantities, might have
been more alert in the Dallas motorcade if they had retired promptly
in Fort Worth. However, there is no evidence that these men failed
to take any action in Dallas within their power that would have
averted the tragedy. As will be seen, the instantaneous and heroic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
response to the assassination of some of the agents concerned was in
the finest tradition of Government service.</p>

<p><i>The motorcade in Dallas.</i>—Rigorous security precautions had
been arranged at Love Field with the local law enforcement authorities
by Agents Sorrels and Lawson. These precautions included
reserving a ceremonial area for the Presidential party, stationing
police on the rooftops of all buildings overlooking the reception area,
and detailing police in civilian clothes to be scattered throughout the
sizable crowd.<a id="FNanchor_C8-201" href="#Footnote_C8-201" class="fnanchor">C8-201</a> When President and Mrs. Kennedy shook hands
with members of the public along the fences surrounding the reception
area, they were closely guarded by Secret Service agents who responded
to the unplanned event with dispatch.<a id="FNanchor_C8-202" href="#Footnote_C8-202" class="fnanchor">C8-202</a></p>

<p>As described in chapter II, the President directed that his car stop
on two occasions during the motorcade so that he could greet members
of the public.<a id="FNanchor_C8-203" href="#Footnote_C8-203" class="fnanchor">C8-203</a> At these stops, agents from the Presidential follow-up
car stood between the President and the public, and on one occasion
Agent Kellerman left the front seat of the President’s car to take a
similar position. The Commission regards such impromptu stops as
presenting an unnecessary danger, but finds that the Secret Service
agents did all that could have been done to take protective measures.</p>

<p><i>The Presidential limousine.</i>—The limousine used by President Kennedy
in Dallas was a convertible with a detachable, rigid plastic
“bubble” top which was neither bulletproof nor bullet resistant.<a id="FNanchor_C8-204" href="#Footnote_C8-204" class="fnanchor">C8-204</a>
The last Presidential vehicle with any protection against small-arms
fire left the White House in 1953. It was not then replaced because
the state of the art did not permit the development of a bulletproof
top of sufficiently light weight to permit its removal on those occasions
when the President wished to ride in an open car. The Secret Service
believed that it was very doubtful that any President would ride regularly
in a vehicle with a fixed top, even though transparent.<a id="FNanchor_C8-205" href="#Footnote_C8-205" class="fnanchor">C8-205</a> Since
the assassination, the Secret Service, with the assistance of other Federal
agencies and of private industry, has developed a vehicle for the
better protection of the President.<a id="FNanchor_C8-206" href="#Footnote_C8-206" class="fnanchor">C8-206</a></p>

<p><i>Access to passenger compartment of Presidential car.</i>—On occasion
the Secret Service has been permitted to have an agent riding in the
passenger compartment with the President. Presidents have made it
clear, however, that they did not favor this or any other arrangement
which interferes with the privacy of the President and his
guests. The Secret Service has therefore suggested this practice only
on extraordinary occasions.<a id="FNanchor_C8-207" href="#Footnote_C8-207" class="fnanchor">C8-207</a> Without attempting to prescribe or
recommend specific measures which should be employed for the future
protection of Presidents, the Commission does believe that there are
aspects of the protective measures employed in the motorcade at
Dallas which deserve special comment.</p>

<p>The Presidential vehicle in use in Dallas, described in chapter II,
had no special design or equipment which would have permitted the
Secret Service agent riding in the driver’s compartment to move into
the passenger section without hindrance or delay. Had the vehicle
been so designed it is possible that an agent riding in the front seat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
could have reached the President in time to protect him from the
second and fatal shot to hit the President. However, such access to
the President was interfered with both by the metal bar some 15
inches above the back of the front seat and by the passengers in the
jump seats. In contrast, the Vice Presidential vehicle, although not
specially designed for that purpose, had no passenger in a jump seat
between Agent Youngblood and Vice President Johnson to interfere
with Agent Youngblood’s ability to take a protective position in the
passenger compartment before the third shot was fired.<a id="FNanchor_C8-208" href="#Footnote_C8-208" class="fnanchor">C8-208</a></p>

<p>The assassination suggests that it would have been of prime importance
in the protection of the President if the Presidential car
permitted immediate access to the President by a Secret Service
agent at the first sign of danger. At that time the agents on the
running boards of the followup car were expected to perform such a
function. However, these agents could not reach the President’s car
when it was traveling at an appreciable rate of speed. Even if the
car is traveling more slowly, the delay involved in reaching the President
may be crucial. It is clear that at the time of the shots in Dallas,
Agent Clinton J. Hill leaped to the President’s rescue as quickly as
humanly possible. Even so, analysis of the motion picture films taken
by amateur photographer Zapruder reveals that Hill first placed his
hand on the Presidential car at frame 343, 30 frames and therefore
approximately 1.6 seconds after the President was shot in the head.<a id="FNanchor_C8-209" href="#Footnote_C8-209" class="fnanchor">C8-209</a>
About 3.7 seconds after the President received this wound, Hill had
both feet on the car and was climbing aboard to assist President
and Mrs. Kennedy.<a id="FNanchor_C8-210" href="#Footnote_C8-210" class="fnanchor">C8-210</a></p>

<p><i>Planning for motorcade contingencies.</i>—In response to inquiry by
the Commission regarding the instructions to agents in a motorcade
of emergency procedures to be taken in a contingency such as that
which actually occurred, the Secret Service responded:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Secret Service has consistently followed two general principles
in emergencies involving the President. All agents are so
instructed. The first duty of the agents in the motorcade is to
attempt to cover the President as closely as possible and practicable
and to shield him by attempting to place themselves between
the President and any source of danger. Secondly, agents
are instructed to remove the President as quickly as possible from
known or impending danger. Agents are instructed that it is
not their responsibility to investigate or evaluate a present danger,
but to consider any untoward circumstances as serious and to
afford the President maximum protection at all times. No responsibility
rests upon those agents near the President for the identification
or arrest of any assassin or an attacker. Their primary
responsibility is to stay with and protect the President.</p>

<p>Beyond these two principles the Secret Service believes a detailed
contingency or emergency plan is not feasible because the
variations possible preclude effective planning. A number of
steps are taken, however, to permit appropriate steps to be taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
in an emergency. For instance, the lead car always is manned
by Secret Service agents familiar with the area and with local
law enforcement officials; the radio net in use in motorcades is
elaborate and permits a number of different means of communication
with various local points. A doctor is in the motorcade.<a id="FNanchor_C8-211" href="#Footnote_C8-211" class="fnanchor">C8-211</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This basic approach to the problem of planning for emergencies is
sound. Any effort to prepare detailed contingency plans might well
have the undesirable effect of inhibiting quick and imaginative responses.
If the advance preparation is thorough, and the protective
devices and techniques employed are sound, those in command should
be able to direct the response appropriate to the emergency.</p>

<p>The Commission finds that the Secret Service agents in the motorcade
who were immediately responsible for the President’s safety reacted
promptly at the time the shots were fired. Their actions demonstrate
that the President and the Nation can expect courage and
devotion to duty from the agents of the Secret Service.</p>

<h3 id="hdr161">RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>

<p>The Commission’s review of the provisions for Presidential protection
at the time of President Kennedy’s trip to Dallas demonstrates
the need for substantial improvements. Since the assassination, the
Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury have properly
taken the initiative in reexamining major aspects of Presidential protection.
Many changes have already been made and others are contemplated,
some of them in response to the Commission’s questions
and informal suggestions.</p>

<h4 id="hdr162">Assassination a Federal Crime</h4>

<p>There was no Federal criminal jurisdiction over the assassination
of President Kennedy. Had there been reason to believe that the
assassination was the result of a conspiracy, Federal jurisdiction could
have been asserted; it has long been a Federal crime to conspire to
injure any Federal officer, on account of, or while he is engaged in,
the lawful discharge of the duties of his office.<a id="FNanchor_C8-212" href="#Footnote_C8-212" class="fnanchor">C8-212</a> Murder of the
President has never been covered by Federal law, however, so that
once it became reasonably clear that the killing was the act of a
single person, the State of Texas had exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

<p>It is anomalous that Congress has legislated in other ways touching
upon the safety of the Chief Executive or other Federal officers, without
making an attack on the President a crime. Threatening harm
to the President is a Federal offense,<a id="FNanchor_C8-213" href="#Footnote_C8-213" class="fnanchor">C8-213</a> as is advocacy of the overthrow
of the Government by the assassination of any of its officers.<a id="FNanchor_C8-214" href="#Footnote_C8-214" class="fnanchor">C8-214</a> The
murder of Federal judges, U.S. attorneys and marshals, and a number
of other specifically designated Federal law enforcement officers is
a Federal crime.<a id="FNanchor_C8-215" href="#Footnote_C8-215" class="fnanchor">C8-215</a> Equally anomalous are statutory provisions which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
specifically authorize the Secret Service to protect the President,
without authorizing it to arrest anyone who harms him. The same
provisions authorize the Service to arrest without warrant persons
committing certain offenses, including counterfeiting and certain
frauds involving Federal checks or securities.<a id="FNanchor_C8-216" href="#Footnote_C8-216" class="fnanchor">C8-216</a> The Commission
agrees with the Secret Service<a id="FNanchor_C8-217" href="#Footnote_C8-217" class="fnanchor">C8-217</a> that it should be authorized to make
arrests without warrant for all offenses within its jurisdiction, as are
FBI agents and Federal marshals.<a id="FNanchor_C8-218" href="#Footnote_C8-218" class="fnanchor">C8-218</a></p>

<p>There have been a number of efforts to make assassination a Federal
crime, particularly after the assassination of President McKinley
and the attempt on the life of President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt.<a id="FNanchor_C8-219" href="#Footnote_C8-219" class="fnanchor">C8-219</a>
In 1902 bills passed both Houses of Congress but failed of enactment
when the Senate refused to accept the conference report.<a id="FNanchor_C8-220" href="#Footnote_C8-220" class="fnanchor">C8-220</a> A number
of bills were introduced immediately following the assassination of
President Kennedy.<a id="FNanchor_C8-221" href="#Footnote_C8-221" class="fnanchor">C8-221</a></p>

<p>The Commission recommends to the Congress that it adopt legislation
which would:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Punish the murder or manslaughter of, attempt or conspiracy
to murder, kidnaping of and assault upon</p>

<p>the President, Vice President, or other officer next in the order
of succession to the Office of President, the President-elect and the
Vice-President-elect,</p>

<p>whether or not the act is committed while the victim is in the
performance of his official duties or on account of such
performance.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a statute would cover the President and Vice President or, in
the absence of a Vice President, the person next in order of succession.
During the period between election and inauguration, the President-elect
and Vice-President-elect would also be covered. Restricting the
coverage in this way would avoid unnecessary controversy over the
inclusion or exclusion of other officials who are in the order of succession
or who hold important governmental posts. In addition, the restriction
would probably eliminate a need for the requirement which
has been urged as necessary for the exercise of Federal power, that
the hostile act occur while the victim is engaged in or because of the
performance of official duties.<a id="FNanchor_C8-222" href="#Footnote_C8-222" class="fnanchor">C8-222</a> The governmental consequences of
assassination of one of the specified officials give the United States
ample power to act for its own protection.<a id="FNanchor_C8-223" href="#Footnote_C8-223" class="fnanchor">C8-223</a> The activities of the victim
at the time an assassination occurs and the motive for the assassination
bear no relationship to the injury to the United States which
follows from the act. This point was ably made in the 1902 debate by
Senator George F. Hoar, the sponsor of the Senate bill:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * what this bill means to punish is the crime of interruption
of the Government of the United States and the destruction of its
security by striking down the life of the person who is actually in
the exercise of the executive power, or of such persons as have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
constitutionally and lawfully provided to succeed thereto in case
of a vacancy. It is important to this country that the interruption
shall not take place for an hour * * *<a id="FNanchor_C8-224" href="#Footnote_C8-224" class="fnanchor">C8-224</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Enactment of this statute would mean that the investigation of any
of the acts covered and of the possibility of a further attempt would
be conducted by Federal law enforcement officials, in particular, the
FBI with the assistance of the Secret Service.<a id="FNanchor_C8-225" href="#Footnote_C8-225" class="fnanchor">C8-225</a> At present, Federal
agencies participate only upon the sufferance of the local authorities.
While the police work of the Dallas authorities in the early
identification and apprehension of Oswald was both efficient and
prompt, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who strongly supports such
legislation, testified that the absence of clear Federal jurisdiction over
the assassination of President Kennedy led to embarrassment and
confusion in the subsequent investigation by Federal and local
authorities.<a id="FNanchor_C8-226" href="#Footnote_C8-226" class="fnanchor">C8-226</a> In addition, the proposed legislation will insure that
any suspects who are arrested will be Federal prisoners, subject to
Federal protection from vigilante justice and other threats.<a id="FNanchor_C8-227" href="#Footnote_C8-227" class="fnanchor">C8-227</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr163">Committee of Cabinet Officers</h4>

<p>As our Government has become more complex, agencies other than
the Secret Service have become involved in phases of the overall problem
of protecting our national leaders. The FBI is the major domestic
investigating agency of the United States, while the CIA has the primary
responsibility for collecting intelligence overseas to supplement
information acquired by the Department of State. The Secret Service
must rely in large part upon the investigating capacity and experience
of these and other agencies for much of its information
regarding possible dangers to the President. The Commission believes
that it is necessary to improve the cooperation among these agencies
and to emphasize that the task of Presidential protection is one of
broad national concern.</p>

<p>The Commission suggests that consideration might be given to assigning
to a Cabinet-level committee or the National Security Council
(which is responsible for advising the President respecting the coordination
of departmental policies relating to the national security)<a id="FNanchor_C8-228" href="#Footnote_C8-228" class="fnanchor">C8-228</a>
the responsibility to review and oversee the protective
activities of the Secret Service and the other Federal agencies that
assist in safeguarding the President. The Committee should include
the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General, and, if the
Council is used, arrangements should be made for the attendance of
the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General at any meetings
which are concerned with Presidential protection.<a id="FNanchor_C8-229" href="#Footnote_C8-229" class="fnanchor">C8-229</a> The Council
already includes, in addition to the President and Vice President,
the Secretaries of State and Defense and has a competent staff.</p>

<p>The foremost assignment of the Committee would be to insure that
the maximum resources of the Federal Government are fully engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
in the job of protecting the President, by defining responsibilities
clearly and overseeing their execution. Major needs of personnel or
other resources might be met more easily on its recommendation than
they have been in the past.</p>

<p>The Committee would be able to provide guidance in defining the
general nature of domestic and foreign dangers to Presidential security.
As improvements are recommended for the advance detection
of potential threats to the President, it could act as a final review
board. The expert assistance and resources which it could draw upon
would be particularly desirable in this complex and sensitive area.</p>

<p>This arrangement would provide a continuing high-level contact
for agencies that may wish to consult respecting particular protective
measures. For various reasons the Secret Service has functioned
largely as an informal part of the White House staff, with the result
that it has been unable, as a practical matter, to exercise sufficient influence
over the security precautions which surround Presidential
activities. A Cabinet-level committee which is actively concerned with
these problems would be able to discuss these matters more effectively
with the President.</p>

<h4 id="hdr164">Responsibilities for Presidential Protection</h4>

<p>The assignment of the responsibility of protecting the President to
an agency of the Department of the Treasury was largely an historical
accident.<a id="FNanchor_C8-230" href="#Footnote_C8-230" class="fnanchor">C8-230</a> The Secret Service was organized as a division of the
Department of the Treasury in 1865, to deal with counterfeiting. In
1894, while investigating a plot to assassinate President Cleveland, the
Service assigned a small protective detail of agents to the White House.
Secret Service men accompanied the President and his family to their
vacation home in Massachusetts and special details protected him in
Washington, on trips, and at special functions. These informal and
part-time arrangements led to more systematic protection in 1902,
after the assassination of President McKinley; the Secret Service, then
the only Federal investigative agency, assumed full-time responsibility
for the safety of the President. Since that time, the Secret Service
has had and exercised responsibility for the physical protection of
the President and also for the preventive investigation of potential
threats against the President.</p>

<p>Although the Secret Service has had the primary responsibility for
the protection of the President, the FBI, which was established within
the Department of Justice in 1908, has had in recent years an increasingly
important role to play. In the appropriations of the FBI there
has recurred annually an item for the “protection of the person of the
President of the United States,” which first appeared in the appropriation
of the Department of Justice in 1910 under the heading “Miscellaneous
Objects.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-231" href="#Footnote_C8-231" class="fnanchor">C8-231</a> Although the FBI is not charged with the
physical protection of the President, it does have an assignment, as do
other Government agencies, in the field of preventive investigation in
regard to the President’s security. As discussed above, the Bureau has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
attempted to meet its responsibilities in this field by spelling out in its
Handbook the procedures which its agents are to follow in connection
with information received “indicating the possibility of an attempt
against the person or safety of the President” or other protected
persons.</p>

<p>With two Federal agencies operating in the same general field of
preventive investigation, questions inevitably arise as to the scope of
each agency’s authority and responsibility. As the testimony of
J. Edgar Hoover and other Bureau officials revealed, the FBI did not
believe that its directive required the Bureau to notify the Secret
Service of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald
which the FBI had accumulated before the President reached Dallas.
On the other hand, the Secret Service had no knowledge whatever of
Oswald, his background, or his employment at the Book Depository,
and Robert I. Bouck, who was in charge of the Protective Research
Section of the Secret Service, believed that the accumulation of the
facts known to the FBI should have constituted a sufficient basis to
warn the Secret Service of the Oswald risk.</p>

<p>The Commission believes that both the FBI and the Secret Service
have too narrowly construed their respective responsibilities. The
Commission has the impression that too much emphasis is placed by
both on the investigation of specific threats by individuals and not
enough on dangers from other sources. In addition, the Commission
has concluded that the Secret Service particularly tends to be the
passive recipient of information regarding such threats and that its
Protective Research Section is not adequately staffed or equipped to
conduct the wider investigative work that is required today for the
security of the President.</p>

<p>During the period the Commission was giving thought to this situation,
the Commission received a number of proposals designed to improve
current arrangements for protecting the President. These
proposals included suggestions to locate exclusive responsibility for all
phases of the work in one or another Government agency, to clarify the
division of authority between the agencies involved, and to retain the
existing system but expand both the scope and the operations of the
existing agencies, particularly those of the Secret Service and the FBI.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out that the FBI, as our chief investigative
agency, is properly manned and equipped to carry on extensive information
gathering functions within the United States. It was also
suggested that it would take a substantial period of time for the Secret
Service to build up the experience and skills necessary to meet the
problem. Consequently the suggestion has been made, on the one hand,
that all preventive investigative functions relating to the security of
the President should be transferred to the FBI, leaving with the
Secret Service only the responsibility for the physical protection of
the President, that is, the guarding function alone.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is urged that all features of the protection of
the President and his family should be committed to an elite and independent
corps. It is also contended that the agents should be intimately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
associated with the life of the Presidential family in all its ramifications
and alert to every danger that might befall it, and ready at
any instant to hazard great danger to themselves in the performance
of their tremendous responsibility. It is suggested that an organization
shorn of its power to investigate all the possibilities of danger to
the President and becoming merely the recipient of information
gathered by others would become limited solely to acts of physical
alertness and personal courage incident to its responsibilities. So circumscribed,
it could not maintain the esprit de corps or the necessary
alertness for this unique and challenging responsibility.</p>

<p>While in accordance with its mandate this Commission has necessarily
examined into the functioning of the various Federal agencies
concerned with the tragic trip of President Kennedy to Dallas and
while it has arrived at certain conclusions in respect thereto, it seems
clear that it was not within the Commission’s responsibility to make
specific recommendations as to the long-range organization of the
President’s protection, except as conclusions flowing directly from its
examination of the President’s assassination can be drawn. The Commission
was not asked to apply itself as did the Hoover Commission
in 1949, for example, to a determination of the optimum organization
of the President’s protection. It would have been necessary for the
Commission to take considerable testimony, much of it extraneous to
the facts of the assassination of President Kennedy, to put it in a
position to reach final conclusions in this respect. There are always
dangers of divided responsibility, duplication, and confusion of authority
where more than one agency is operating in the same field;
but on the other hand the protection of the President is in a real
sense a Government-wide responsibility which must necessarily be
assumed by the Department of State, the FBI, the CIA, and the military
intelligence agencies as well as the Secret Service. Moreover,
a number of imponderable questions have to be weighed if any change
in the intimate association now established between the Secret Service
and the President and his family is contemplated.</p>

<p>These considerations have induced the Commission to believe that
the determination of whether or not there should be a relocation of
responsibilities and functions should be left to the Executive and the
Congress, perhaps upon recommendations based on further studies
by the Cabinet-level committee recommended above or the National
Security Council.</p>

<p>Pending any such determination, however, this Commission is convinced
of the necessity of better coordination and direction of the
activities of all existing agencies of Government which are in a position
to, and do, furnish information and services related to the security
of the President. The Commission feels the Secret Service and the
FBI, as well as the State Department and the CIA when the President
travels abroad, could improve their existing capacities and
procedures so as to lessen the chances of assassination. Without,
therefore, coming to final conclusions respecting the long-range
organization of the President’s security, the Commission believes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
that the facts of the assassination of President Kennedy point
to certain measures which, while assuming no radical relocation of
responsibilities, can and should be recommended by this Commission
in the interest of the more efficient protection of the President. These
recommendations are reviewed below.</p>

<h4 id="hdr165">General Supervision of the Secret Service</h4>

<p>The intimacy of the Secret Service’s relationship to the White
House and the dissimilarity of its protective functions to most activities
of the Department of the Treasury have made it difficult for the
Treasury to maintain close and continuing supervision. The Commission
believes that the recommended Cabinet-level committee will
help to correct many of the major deficiencies of supervision disclosed
by the Commission’s investigation. Other measures should be taken as
well to improve the overall operation of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Daily supervision of the operations of the Secret Service within
the Department of the Treasury should be improved. The Chief of
the Service now reports to the Secretary of the Treasury through
an Assistant Secretary whose duties also include the direct supervision
of the Bureau of the Mint and the Department’s Employment
Policy Program, and who also represents the Secretary of the Treasury
on various committees and groups.<a id="FNanchor_C8-232" href="#Footnote_C8-232" class="fnanchor">C8-232</a> The incumbent has no technical
qualifications in the area of Presidential protection.<a id="FNanchor_C8-233" href="#Footnote_C8-233" class="fnanchor">C8-233</a> The
Commission recommends that the Secretary of the Treasury appoint
a special assistant with the responsibility of supervising the Service.
This special assistant should be required to have sufficient stature and
experience in law enforcement, intelligence, or allied fields to be able
to provide effective continuing supervision, and to keep the Secretary
fully informed regarding all significant developments relating to
Presidential protection.</p>

<p>This report has already pointed out several respects in which the
Commission believes that the Secret Service has operated with insufficient
planning or control. Actions by the Service since the assassination
indicate its awareness of the necessity for substantial improvement
in its administration. A formal and thorough description
of the responsibilities of the advance agent is now in preparation
by the Service.<a id="FNanchor_C8-234" href="#Footnote_C8-234" class="fnanchor">C8-234</a> Work is going forward toward the preparation
of formal understandings of the respective roles of the Secret Service
and other agencies with which it collaborates or from which it derives
assistance and support. The Commission urges that the Service continue
this effort to overhaul and define its procedures. While manuals
and memoranda are no guarantee of effective operations, no sizable
organization can achieve efficiency without the careful analysis and
demarcation of responsibility that is reflected in definite and comprehensive
operating procedures.</p>

<p>The Commission also recommends that the Secret Service consciously
set about the task of inculcating and maintaining the highest
standard of excellence and esprit for all of its personnel. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
involves tight and unswerving discipline as well as the promotion of an
outstanding degree of dedication and loyalty to duty. The Commission
emphasizes that it finds no causal connection between the assassination
and the breach of regulations which occurred on the night of
November 21 at Fort Worth. Nevertheless, such a breach, in which
so many agents participated, is not consistent with the standards
which the responsibilities of the Secret Service require it to meet.</p>

<h4 id="hdr166">Preventive Intelligence</h4>

<p>In attempting to identify those individuals who might prove a
danger to the President, the Secret Service has largely been the passive
recipient of threatening communications to the President and
reports from other agencies which independently evaluate their information
for potential sources of danger. This was the consequence
of the Service’s lack of an adequate investigative staff, its inability
to process large amounts of data, and its failure to provide specific
descriptions of the kind of information it sought.<a id="FNanchor_C8-235" href="#Footnote_C8-235" class="fnanchor">C8-235</a></p>

<p>The Secret Service has embarked upon a complete overhaul of its
research activities.<a id="FNanchor_C8-236" href="#Footnote_C8-236" class="fnanchor">C8-236</a> The staff of the Protective Research Section
(PRS) has been augmented, and a Secret Service inspector has been
put in charge of this operation. With the assistance of the President’s
Office of Science and Technology, and of the Advanced Research Projects
Agency of the Department of Defense, it has obtained the services
of outside consultants, such as the Rand Corp., International Business
Machines Corp., and a panel of psychiatric and psychological experts.
It has received assistance also from data processing experts at the
CIA and from a specialist in psychiatric prognostication at Walter
Reed Hospital.<a id="FNanchor_C8-237" href="#Footnote_C8-237" class="fnanchor">C8-237</a> As a result of these studies, the planning document
submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Bureau of the
Budget on August 31, 1964, makes several significant recommendations
in this field.<a id="FNanchor_C8-238" href="#Footnote_C8-238" class="fnanchor">C8-238</a> Based on the Commission’s investigation, the
following minimum goals for improvements are indicated:</p>

<p><i>Broader and more selective criteria.</i>—Since the assassination, both
the Secret Service and the FBI have recognized that the PRS files
can no longer be limited largely to persons communicating actual
threats to the President. On December 26, 1963, the FBI circulated
additional instructions to all its agents, specifying criteria for information
to be furnished to the Secret Service in addition to that covered
by the former standard, which was the possibility of an attempt
against the person or safety of the President. The new instructions
require FBI agents to report immediately information concerning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Subversives, ultrarightists, racists and fascists (a) possessing
emotional instability or irrational behavior, (b) who have made
threats of bodily harm against officials or employees of Federal,
state or local government or officials of a foreign government, (c)
who express or have expressed strong or violent anti-U.S. sentiments
and who have been involved in bombing or bomb-making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
or whose past conduct indicates tendencies toward violence, and
(d) whose prior acts or statements depict propensity for violence
and hatred against organized government.<a id="FNanchor_C8-239" href="#Footnote_C8-239" class="fnanchor">C8-239</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Alan H. Belmont, Assistant to the Director of the FBI, testified that
this revision was initiated by the FBI itself.<a id="FNanchor_C8-240" href="#Footnote_C8-240" class="fnanchor">C8-240</a> The volume of references
to the Secret Service has increased substantially since the new
instructions went into effect; more than 5,000 names were referred
to the Secret Service in the first 4 months of 1964.<a id="FNanchor_C8-241" href="#Footnote_C8-241" class="fnanchor">C8-241</a> According to
Chief Rowley, by mid-June 1964, the Secret Service had received
from the FBI some 9,000 reports on members of the Communist
Party.<a id="FNanchor_C8-242" href="#Footnote_C8-242" class="fnanchor">C8-242</a> The FBI now transmits information on all defectors,<a id="FNanchor_C8-243" href="#Footnote_C8-243" class="fnanchor">C8-243</a> a
category which would, of course, have included Oswald.</p>

<p>Both Director Hoover and Belmont expressed to the Commission
the great concern of the FBI, which is shared by the Secret Service,
that referrals to the Secret Service under the new criteria might, if
not properly handled, result in some degree of interference with the
personal liberty of those involved.<a id="FNanchor_C8-244" href="#Footnote_C8-244" class="fnanchor">C8-244</a> They emphasized the necessity
that the information now being furnished be handled with judgment
and care. The Commission shares this concern. The problem is aggravated
by the necessity that the Service obtain the assistance of
local law enforcement officials in evaluating the information which it
receives and in taking preventive steps.</p>

<p>In June 1964, the Secret Service sent to a number of Federal law
enforcement and intelligence agencies guidelines for an experimental
program to develop more detailed criteria.<a id="FNanchor_C8-245" href="#Footnote_C8-245" class="fnanchor">C8-245</a> The suggestions of
Federal agencies for revision of these guidelines were solicited. The
new tentative criteria are useful in making clear that the interest
of the Secret Service goes beyond information on individuals or
groups threatening to cause harm or embarrassment to the President.<a id="FNanchor_C8-246" href="#Footnote_C8-246" class="fnanchor">C8-246</a>
Information is requested also concerning individuals or
groups who have demonstrated an interest in the President or “other
high government officials in the nature of a complaint coupled with
an expressed or implied determination to use a means, other than
legal or peaceful, to satisfy any grievance, real or imagined.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-247" href="#Footnote_C8-247" class="fnanchor">C8-247</a>
Under these criteria, whether the case should be referred to the Secret
Service depends on the existence of a previous history of mental
instability, propensity toward violent action, or some similar characteristic,
coupled with some evaluation of the capability of the individual
or group to further the intention to satisfy a grievance by
unlawful means.<a id="FNanchor_C8-248" href="#Footnote_C8-248" class="fnanchor">C8-248</a></p>

<p>While these tentative criteria are a step in the right direction, they
seem unduly restrictive in continuing to require some manifestation
of animus against a Government official. It is questionable whether
such criteria would have resulted in the referral of Oswald to the
Secret Service. Chief Rowley believed that they would, because of
Oswald’s demonstrated hostility toward the Secretary of the Navy
in his letter of January 30, 1962.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span><a id="FNanchor_C8-249" href="#Footnote_C8-249" class="fnanchor">C8-249</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I shall employ all means to right this gross mistake or injustice
to a boni-fied U.S. citizen and ex-service man. The U.S. government
has no charges or complaints against me. I ask you to look
into this case and take the necessary steps to repair the damage
done to me and my family.<a id="FNanchor_C8-250" href="#Footnote_C8-250" class="fnanchor">C8-250</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Even with the advantage of hindsight, this letter does not appear to
express or imply Oswald’s “determination to use a means, other than
legal or peaceful, to satisfy [his] grievance” within the meaning of
the new criteria.<a id="FNanchor_C8-251" href="#Footnote_C8-251" class="fnanchor">C8-251</a></p>

<p>It is apparent that a good deal of further consideration and experimentation
will be required before adequate criteria can be framed.
The Commission recognizes that no set of meaningful criteria will
yield the names of all potential assassins. Charles J. Guiteau, Leon F.
Czolgosz, John Schrank, and Guiseppe Zangara—four assassins or
would-be assassins—were all men who acted alone in their criminal
acts against our leaders.<a id="FNanchor_C8-252" href="#Footnote_C8-252" class="fnanchor">C8-252</a> None had a serious record of prior violence.
Each of them was a failure in his work and in his relations with others,
a victim of delusions and fancies which led to the conviction that society
and its leaders had combined to thwart him. It will require
every available resource of our Government to devise a practical
system which has any reasonable possibility of revealing such
malcontents.</p>

<p><i>Liaison with other agencies regarding intelligence.</i>—The Secret
Service’s liaison with the agencies that supply information to it has
been too casual. Since the assassination, the Service has recognized
that these relationships must be far more formal, and each agency
given clear understanding of the assistance which the Secret Service
expects.<a id="FNanchor_C8-253" href="#Footnote_C8-253" class="fnanchor">C8-253</a></p>

<p>Once the Secret Service has formulated its new standards for collection
of information, it should enter into written agreements with
each Federal agency and the leading State and local agencies that
might be a source of such information. Such agreements should describe
in detail the information which is sought, the manner in which it
will be provided to the Secret Service, and the respective responsibilities
for any further investigation that may be required.</p>

<p>This is especially necessary with regard to the FBI and CIA, which
carry the major responsibility for supplying information about potential
threats, particularly those arising from organized groups,
within their special jurisdiction. Since these agencies are already
obliged constantly to evaluate the activities of such groups, they
should be responsible for advising the Secret Service if information
develops indicating the existence of an assassination plot and for reporting
such events as a change in leadership or dogma which indicate
that the group may present a danger to the President. Detailed formal
agreements embodying these arrangements should be worked out
between the Secret Service and both of these agencies.</p>

<p>It should be made clear that the Secret Service will in no way seek
to duplicate the intelligence and investigative capabilities of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
agencies now operating in this field but will continue to use the data
developed by these agencies to carry out its special duties. Once experience
has been gained in implementing such agreements with the
Federal and leading State and local agencies, the Secret Service,
through its field offices, should negotiate similar arrangements with
such other State and local law enforcement agencies as may provide
meaningful assistance. Much useful information will come to the
attention of local law enforcement agencies in the regular course of
their activities, and this source should not be neglected by undue
concentration on relationships with other Federal agencies. Finally,
these agreements with Federal and local authorities will be of little
value unless a system is established for the frequent formal review
of activities thereunder.</p>

<p>In this regard the Commission notes with approval several recent
measures taken and proposed by the Secret Service to improve its
liaison arrangements. In his testimony Secretary of the Treasury
C. Douglas Dillon informed the Commission that an interagency committee
has been established to develop more effective criteria. According
to Secretary Dillon, the Committee will include representatives
of the President’s Office of Science and Technology, Department of
Defense, CIA, FBI, and the Secret Service.<a id="FNanchor_C8-254" href="#Footnote_C8-254" class="fnanchor">C8-254</a> In addition, the Department
of the Treasury has requested five additional agents for its
Protective Research Section to serve as liaison officers with law enforcement
and intelligence agencies.<a id="FNanchor_C8-255" href="#Footnote_C8-255" class="fnanchor">C8-255</a> On the basis of the Department’s
review during the past several months, Secretary Dillon testified
that the use of such liaison officers is the only effective way to
insure that adequate liaison is maintained.<a id="FNanchor_C8-256" href="#Footnote_C8-256" class="fnanchor">C8-256</a> As a beginning step to
improve liaison with local law enforcement officials, the Secret Service
on August 26, 1964, directed its field representatives to send a form
request for intelligence information to all local, county, and State law
enforcement agencies in their districts.<a id="FNanchor_C8-257" href="#Footnote_C8-257" class="fnanchor">C8-257</a> Each of these efforts appears
sound, and the Commission recommends that these and the other
measures suggested by the Commission be pursued vigorously by the
Secret Service.</p>

<p><i>Automatic data processing.</i>—Unless the Secret Service is able to
deal rapidly and accurately with a growing body of data, the increased
information supplied by other agencies will be wasted. PRS must
develop the capacity to classify its subjects on a more sophisticated
basis than the present geographic breakdown. Its present manual
filing system is obsolete; it makes no use of the recent developments in
automatic data processing which are widely used in the business world
and in other Government offices.</p>

<p>The Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury now recognize
this critical need. In the planning document currently under
review by the Bureau of the Budget, the Department recommends
that it be permitted to hire five qualified persons “to plan and develop
a workable and efficient automated file and retrieval system.”<a id="FNanchor_C8-258" href="#Footnote_C8-258" class="fnanchor">C8-258</a>
Also the Department requests the sum of $100,000 to conduct a detailed
feasibility study; this money would be used to compensate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
consultants, to lease standard equipment or to purchase specially
designed pilot equipment.<a id="FNanchor_C8-259" href="#Footnote_C8-259" class="fnanchor">C8-259</a> On the basis of such a feasibility study,
the Department hopes to design a practical system which will fully
meet the needs of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>The Commission recommends that prompt and favorable consideration
be given to this request. The Commission further recommends
that the Secret Service coordinate its planning as closely as possible
with all of the Federal agencies from which it receives information.
The Secret Service should not and does not plan to develop its own
intelligence gathering facilities to duplicate the existing facilities of
other Federal agencies. In planning its data processing techniques,
the Secret Service should attempt to develop a system compatible
with those of the agencies from which most of its data will come.<a id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a></p>

<div class="footnoteb">

<p><a id="Footnote_E" href="#FNanchor_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> In evaluating data processing techniques of the Secret Service, the Commission had
occasion to become informed, to a limited extent, about the data processing techniques
of other Federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The Commission was struck
by the apparent lack of effort, on an interagency basis, to develop coordinated and mutually
compatible systems, even where such coordination would not seem inconsistent
with the particular purposes of the agency involved. The Commission recognizes that
this is a controversial area and that many strongly held views are advanced in resistance
to any suggestion that an effort be made to impose any degree of coordination. This
matter is obviously beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission, but it seems to warrant
further study before each agency becomes irrevocably committed to separate action. The
Commission, therefore, recommends that the President consider ordering an inquiry into
the possibility that coordination might be achieved to a greater extent than seems now
to be contemplated, without interference with the primary mission of each agency involved.</p></div>

<p><i>Protective Research participation in advance arrangements.</i>—Since
the assassination, Secret Service procedures have been changed to
require that a member of PRS accompany each advance survey team
to establish liaison with local intelligence gathering agencies and to
provide for the immediate evaluation of information received from
them.<a id="FNanchor_C8-260" href="#Footnote_C8-260" class="fnanchor">C8-260</a> This PRS agent will also be responsible for establishing an
informal local liaison committee to make certain that all protective
intelligence activities are coordinated. Based on its experience during
this period, the Secret Service now recommends that additional
personnel be made available to PRS so that these arrangements can
be made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the
Service’s field offices.<a id="FNanchor_C8-261" href="#Footnote_C8-261" class="fnanchor">C8-261</a> The Commission regards this as a most useful
innovation and urges that the practice be continued.</p>

<h4 id="hdr167">Liaison With Local Law Enforcement Agencies</h4>

<p>Advice by the Secret Service to local police in metropolitan areas
relating to the assistance expected in connection with a Presidential
visit has hitherto been handled on an informal basis.<a id="FNanchor_C8-262" href="#Footnote_C8-262" class="fnanchor">C8-262</a> The Service
should consider preparing formal explanations of the cooperation anticipated
during a Presidential visit to a city, in formats that can be
communicated to each level of local authorities. Thus, the local chief
of police could be given a master plan, prepared for the occasion, of
all protective measures to be taken during the visit; each patrolman
might be given a prepared booklet of instructions explaining what is
expected of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
The Secret Service has expressed concern that written instructions
might come into the hands of local newspapers, to the prejudice of
the precautions described.<a id="FNanchor_C8-263" href="#Footnote_C8-263" class="fnanchor">C8-263</a> However, the instructions must be communicated
to the local police in any event and can be leaked to the
press whether or not they are in writing. More importantly, the lack
of carefully prepared and carefully transmitted instructions for
typical visits to cities can lead to lapses in protection, such as the
confusion in Dallas about whether members of the public were permitted
on overpasses.<a id="FNanchor_C8-264" href="#Footnote_C8-264" class="fnanchor">C8-264</a> Such instructions will not fit all circumstances,
of course, and should not be relied upon to the detriment of
the imaginative application of judgment in special cases.</p>

<h4 id="hdr168">Inspection of Buildings</h4>

<p>Since the assassination of President Kennedy, the Secret Service
has been experimenting with new techniques in the inspection of
buildings along a motorcade route.<a id="FNanchor_C8-265" href="#Footnote_C8-265" class="fnanchor">C8-265</a> According to Secretary Dillon,
the studies indicate that there is some utility in attempting to designate
certain buildings as involving a higher risk than others.<a id="FNanchor_C8-266" href="#Footnote_C8-266" class="fnanchor">C8-266</a> The
Commission strongly encourages these efforts to improve protection
along a motorcade route. The Secret Service should utilize the personnel
of other Federal law enforcement offices in the locality to assure
adequate manpower for this task, as it is now doing.<a id="FNanchor_C8-267" href="#Footnote_C8-267" class="fnanchor">C8-267</a> Lack of adequate
resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to improve advance
precautions in this crucial area of Presidential protection.</p>

<h4 id="hdr169">Secret Service Personnel and Facilities</h4>

<p>Testimony and other evidence before the Commission suggest that
the Secret Service is trying to accomplish its job with too few people
and without adequate modern equipment. Although Chief Rowley
does not complain about the pay scale for Secret Service agents, salaries
are below those of the FBI and leading municipal police forces.<a id="FNanchor_C8-268" href="#Footnote_C8-268" class="fnanchor">C8-268</a>
The assistant to the Director of the FBI testified that the caseload of
each FBI agent averaged 20-25, and he felt that this was high.<a id="FNanchor_C8-269" href="#Footnote_C8-269" class="fnanchor">C8-269</a>
Chief Rowley testified that the present workload of each Secret Service
agent averages 110.1 cases.<a id="FNanchor_C8-270" href="#Footnote_C8-270" class="fnanchor">C8-270</a> While these statistics relate to the
activities of Secret Service agents stationed in field offices and not the
White House detail, field agents supplement those on the detail, particularly
when the President is traveling. Although the Commission
does not know whether the cases involved are entirely comparable,
these figures suggest that the agents of the Secret Service are substantially
overworked.</p>

<p>In its budget request for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1964, the
Secret Service sought funds for 25 new positions, primarily in field
offices.<a id="FNanchor_C8-271" href="#Footnote_C8-271" class="fnanchor">C8-271</a> This increase has been approved by the Congress.<a id="FNanchor_C8-272" href="#Footnote_C8-272" class="fnanchor">C8-272</a>
Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional
manpower to take all the measures which he considers required. However,
the 1964-65 budget request was submitted in November 1963 and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
requests for additional personnel were not made because of the studies
then being conducted.<a id="FNanchor_C8-273" href="#Footnote_C8-273" class="fnanchor">C8-273</a></p>

<p>The Secret Service has now presented its recommendations to the
Bureau of the Budget.<a id="FNanchor_C8-274" href="#Footnote_C8-274" class="fnanchor">C8-274</a> The plan proposed by the Service would
take approximately 20 months to implement and require expenditures
of approximately $3 million during that period. The plan provides
for an additional 205 agents for the Secret Service. Seventeen of this
number are proposed for the Protective Research Section; 145 are
proposed for the field offices to handle the increased volume of security
investigations and be available to protect the President or Vice President
when they travel; 18 agents are proposed for a rotating pool
which will go through an intensive training cycle and also be available
to supplement the White House detail in case of unexpected
need; and 25 additional agents are recommended to provide the Vice
President full protection.</p>

<p>The Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these
recommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for
the necessary supplemental appropriation, as soon as it can be justified.
The Congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable
request for funds for the protection of the President.<a id="FNanchor_C8-275" href="#Footnote_C8-275" class="fnanchor">C8-275</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr170">Manpower and Technical Assistance From Other Agencies</h4>

<p>Before the assassination the Secret Service infrequently requested
other Federal law enforcement agencies to provide personnel to assist
in its protection functions.<a id="FNanchor_C8-276" href="#Footnote_C8-276" class="fnanchor">C8-276</a> Since the assassination, the Service
has experimented with the use of agents borrowed for short periods
from such agencies. It has used other Treasury law enforcement
agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places
to which the President frequently travels.<a id="FNanchor_C8-277" href="#Footnote_C8-277" class="fnanchor">C8-277</a> It has also used other
Federal law enforcement agents during Presidential visits to cities
in which such agents are stationed. Thus, in the 4 months following
the assassination, the FBI, on 16 separate occasions, supplied a total
of 139 agents to assist in protection work during a Presidential visit,<a id="FNanchor_C8-278" href="#Footnote_C8-278" class="fnanchor">C8-278</a>
which represents a departure from its prior practice.<a id="FNanchor_C8-279" href="#Footnote_C8-279" class="fnanchor">C8-279</a> From
February 11 through June 30, 1964, the Service had the advantage
of 9,500 hours of work by other enforcement agencies.<a id="FNanchor_C8-280" href="#Footnote_C8-280" class="fnanchor">C8-280</a></p>

<p>The FBI has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such
assistance available, even though it agrees with the Secret Service that
it is preferable for the Service to have enough agents to handle all
protective demands.<a id="FNanchor_C8-281" href="#Footnote_C8-281" class="fnanchor">C8-281</a> The Commission endorses these efforts to
supplement the Service’s own personnel by obtaining, for short periods
of time, the assistance of trained Federal law enforcement officers. In
view of the ever-increasing mobility of American Presidents, it seems
unlikely that the Service could or should increase its own staff to a
size which would permit it to provide adequate protective manpower
for all situations. The Commission recommends that the agencies
involved determine how much periodic assistance they can provide, and
that each such agency and the Secret Service enter into a formal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
agreement defining such arrangements. It may eventually be desirable
to codify the practice in an Executive order. The Secret Service will
be better able to plan its own long-range personnel requirements if
it knows with reasonable certainty the amount of assistance that it
can expect from other agencies.</p>

<p>The occasional use of personnel from other Federal agencies to assist
in protecting the President has a further advantage. It symbolizes
the reality that the job of protecting the President has not been and
cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the Secret Service. The
Secret Service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to be acknowledged
as the sole protector of the Chief Executive. This no
longer appears to be the case.<a id="FNanchor_C8-282" href="#Footnote_C8-282" class="fnanchor">C8-282</a> Protecting the President is a difficult
and complex task which requires full use of the best resources of many
parts of our Government. Recognition that the responsibility must
be shared increases the likelihood that it will be met.</p>

<p>Much of the Secret Service work requires the development and use
of highly sophisticated equipment, some of which must be specially
designed to fit unique requirements. Even before the assassination,
and to a far greater extent thereafter, the Secret Service has been
receiving full cooperation in scientific research and technological
development from many Government agencies including the
Department of Defense and the President’s Office of Science and
Technology.<a id="FNanchor_C8-283" href="#Footnote_C8-283" class="fnanchor">C8-283</a></p>

<p>Even if the manpower and technological resources of the Secret
Service are adequately augmented, it will continue to rely in many
respects upon the greater resources of the Office of Science and Technology
and other agencies. The Commission recommends that the
present arrangements with the Office of Science and Technology and
the other Federal agencies that have been so helpful to the Secret Service
be placed on a permanent and formal basis. The exchange of letters
dated August 31, 1964, between Secretary Dillon and Donald F.
Hornig, Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology,
is a useful effort in the right direction.<a id="FNanchor_C8-284" href="#Footnote_C8-284" class="fnanchor">C8-284</a> The Service should
negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has
been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the
future. The essential terms of such memoranda might well be embodied
in an Executive order.</p>

<h3 id="hdr171">CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection
of our Presidents which will guarantee security. The demands
on the President in the execution of his responsibilities in
today’s world are so varied and complex and the traditions of the
office in a democracy such as ours are so deepseated as to preclude
absolute security.</p>

<p>The Commission has, however, from its examination of the facts
of President Kennedy’s assassination made certain recommendations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
which it believes would, if adopted, materially improve upon the
procedures in effect at the time of President Kennedy’s assassination
and result in a substantial lessening of the danger.</p>

<p>As has been pointed out, the Commission has not resolved all the
proposals which could be made. The Commission nevertheless is
confident that, with the active cooperation of the responsible agencies
and with the understanding of the people of the United States
in their demands upon their President, the recommendations we have
here suggested would greatly advance the security of the office without
any impairment of our fundamental liberties.</p>

<span class="subhead">A Brief History of Presidential Protection</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the course of the history of the United States four Presidents
have been assassinated, within less than 100 years, beginning with
Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Attempts were also made on the lives of
two other Presidents, one President-elect, and one ex-President. Still
other Presidents were the objects of plots that were never carried out.
The actual attempts occurred as follows:</p>

<p>Attempts have thus been made on the lives of one of every five
American Presidents. One of every nine Presidents has been killed.
Since 1865, there have been attempts on the lives of one of every four
Presidents and the successful assassination of one of every five. During
the last three decades, three attacks were made.</p>

<p>It was only after William McKinley was shot that systematic and
continuous protection of the President was instituted. Protection
before McKinley was intermittent and spasmodic. The problem had
existed from the days of the early Presidents, but no action was taken
until three tragic events had occurred. In considering the effectiveness
of present day protection arrangements, it is worthwhile to
examine the development of Presidential protection over the years, to
understand both the high degree of continuing danger and the anomalous
reluctance to take the necessary precautions.</p>

<h3 id="hdr185">BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR</h3>

<p>In the early days of the Republic, there was remarkably little concern
about the safety of Presidents and few measures were taken to protect
them. They were at times the objects of abuse and the recipients
of threatening letters as more recent Presidents have been, but they
did not take the threats seriously and moved about freely without protective
escorts. On his inauguration day, Thomas Jefferson walked
from his boarding house to the Capitol, unaccompanied by any guard,
to take the oath of office. There was no police authority in Washington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
itself until 1805 when the mayor appointed a high constable and 40
deputy constables.<a id="FNanchor_A7-1" href="#Footnote_A7-1" class="fnanchor">A7-1</a></p>

<p>John Quincy Adams received many threatening letters and on one
occasion was threatened in person in the White House by a court-martialed
Army sergeant. In spite of this incident, the President
asked for no protection and continued to indulge his fondness for
solitary walks and early morning swims in the Potomac.<a id="FNanchor_A7-2" href="#Footnote_A7-2" class="fnanchor">A7-2</a></p>

<p>Among pre-Civil War Presidents, Andrew Jackson aroused particularly
strong feelings. He received many threatening letters
which, with a fine contempt, he would endorse and send to the Washington
Globe for publication. On one occasion in May 1833, Jackson
was assaulted by a former Navy lieutenant, Robert B. Randolph, but
refused to prosecute him. This is not regarded as an attempt at
assassination, since Randolph apparently did not intend serious
injury.<a id="FNanchor_A7-3" href="#Footnote_A7-3" class="fnanchor">A7-3</a></p>

<p>Less than 2 years later, on the morning of January 10, 1835, as
Jackson emerged from the east portico of the Capitol, he was accosted
by a would-be assassin, Richard Lawrence, an English-born
house painter. Lawrence fired his two pistols at the President, but
they both misfired. Lawrence was quickly overpowered and held for
trial. A jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity. He was
confined in jails and mental hospitals for the rest of his life.<a id="FNanchor_A7-4" href="#Footnote_A7-4" class="fnanchor">A7-4</a></p>

<p>The attack on Jackson did not inspire any action to provide protection
for the Chief Executive. Jackson’s immediate successor,
Martin Van Buren, often walked to church alone and rode horseback
alone in the woods not far from the White House. In August 1842,
after an intoxicated painter had thrown rocks at President John Tyler,
who was walking on the grounds to the south of the White House,
Congress passed an act to establish an auxiliary watch for the protection
of public and private property in Washington. The force
was to consist of a captain and 15 men. This act was apparently
aimed more at the protection of the White House, which had been
defaced on occasion, than of the President.<a id="FNanchor_A7-5" href="#Footnote_A7-5" class="fnanchor">A7-5</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr186">LINCOLN</h3>

<p>Even before he took the oath of office, Abraham Lincoln was thought
to be the object of plots and conspiracies to kidnap or kill him. Extremist
opponents apparently contemplated desperate measures to
prevent his inauguration, and there is some evidence that they plotted
to attack him while he was passing through Baltimore on his way
to Washington.<a id="FNanchor_A7-6" href="#Footnote_A7-6" class="fnanchor">A7-6</a></p>

<p>For the inauguration, the Army took precautions unprecedented
up to that time and perhaps more elaborate than any precautions
taken since. Soldiers occupied strategic points throughout the city,
along the procession route, and at the Capitol, while armed men in
plain clothes mingled with the crowds. Lincoln himself, in a carriage
with President Buchanan, was surrounded on all sides by such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
dense masses of soldiers that he was almost completely hidden from
the view of the crowds. The precautions at the Capitol during the
ceremony were almost as thorough and equally successful.<a id="FNanchor_A7-7" href="#Footnote_A7-7" class="fnanchor">A7-7</a></p>

<p>Lincoln lived in peril during all his years in office. The volume
of threatening letters remained high throughout the war, but little
attention was paid to them. The few letters that were investigated
yielded no results.<a id="FNanchor_A7-8" href="#Footnote_A7-8" class="fnanchor">A7-8</a> He was reluctant to surround himself with
guards and often rejected protection or sought to slip away from it.
This has been characteristic of almost all American Presidents.
They have regarded protection as a necessary affliction at best and
contrary to their normal instincts for either personal privacy or freedom
to meet the people. In Lincoln these instincts were especially
strong, and he suffered with impatience the efforts of his friends,
the police, and the military to safeguard him.<a id="FNanchor_A7-9" href="#Footnote_A7-9" class="fnanchor">A7-9</a></p>

<p>The protection of the President during the war varied greatly,
depending on Lincoln’s susceptibility to warnings. Frequently, military
units were assigned to guard the White House and to accompany
the President on his travels. Lincoln’s friend, Ward H. Lamon, on
becoming marshal of the District of Columbia in 1861, took personal
charge of protecting the President and provided guards for the purpose,
but he became so exasperated at the President’s lack of cooperation
that he tendered his resignation. Lincoln did not accept it.
Finally, late in the war, in November 1864, four Washington policemen
were detailed to the White House to act as personal bodyguards
to the President. Lincoln tolerated them reluctantly and insisted
they remain as inconspicuous as possible.<a id="FNanchor_A7-10" href="#Footnote_A7-10" class="fnanchor">A7-10</a></p>

<p>In the closing days of the war, rumors of attempts on Lincoln’s life
persisted. The well-known actor, John Wilkes Booth, a fanatical
Confederate sympathizer, plotted with others for months to kidnap
the President. The fall of the Confederacy apparently hardened
his determination to kill Lincoln.<a id="FNanchor_A7-11" href="#Footnote_A7-11" class="fnanchor">A7-11</a> Booth’s opportunity came on
Good Friday, April 14, 1865, when he learned that the President
would be attending a play at Ford’s Theater that night. The
President’s bodyguard for the evening was Patrolman John F. Parker
of the Washington Police, a man who proved himself unfit for protective
duty. He was supposed to remain on guard in the corridor
outside of the Presidential box during the entire performance of the
play, but he soon wandered off to watch the play and then even went
outside the theater to have a drink at a nearby saloon. Parker’s
dereliction of duty left the President totally unprotected.<a id="FNanchor_A7-12" href="#Footnote_A7-12" class="fnanchor">A7-12</a> Shortly
after 10 o’clock on that evening, Booth found his way up to the Presidential
box and shot the President in the head. The President’s
wound was a mortal one; he died the next morning, April 15.<a id="FNanchor_A7-13" href="#Footnote_A7-13" class="fnanchor">A7-13</a></p>

<p>A detachment of troops captured Booth on April 26 at a farm near
Bowling Green, Va.; he received a bullet wound and died a few hours
later. At a trial in June, a military tribunal sentenced four of
Booth’s associates to death and four others to terms of imprisonment.<a id="FNanchor_A7-14" href="#Footnote_A7-14" class="fnanchor">A7-14</a></p>

<p>Lincoln’s assassination revealed the total inadequacy of Presidential
protection. A congressional committee conducted an extensive investigation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
of the assassination, but with traditional reluctance, called
for no action to provide better protection for the President in the
future. Nor did requests for protective measures come from the
President or from Government departments. This lack of concern
for the protection of the President may have derived also from
the tendency of the time to regard Lincoln’s assassination as part of
a unique crisis that was not likely to happen to a future Chief
Executive.<a id="FNanchor_A7-15" href="#Footnote_A7-15" class="fnanchor">A7-15</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr187">THE NEED FOR PROTECTION FURTHER DEMONSTRATED</h3>

<p>For a short time after the war, soldiers assigned by the War Department
continued to protect the White House and its grounds. Metropolitan
Washington policemen assisted on special occasions to
maintain order and prevent the congregation of crowds. The permanent
Metropolitan Police guard was reduced to three and assigned
entirely to protection at the White House. There was no special
group of trained officers to protect the person of the President. Presidents
after Lincoln continued to move about in Washington virtually
unattended, as their predecessors had done before the Civil War, and,
as before, such protection as they got at the White House came from
the doormen, who were not especially trained for guard duty.<a id="FNanchor_A7-16" href="#Footnote_A7-16" class="fnanchor">A7-16</a></p>

<p>This lack of personal protection for the President came again
tragically to the attention of the country with the shooting of President
James A. Garfield in 1881. The President’s assassin, Charles J.
Guiteau, was a self-styled “lawyer, theologian, and politician” who
had convinced himself that his unsolicited efforts to help elect Garfield
in 1880 entitled him to appointment as a consul in Europe. Bitterly
disappointed that the President ignored his repeated written
requests for appointment to office and obsessed with a kind of megalomania,
he resolved to kill Garfield.</p>

<p>At that time Guiteau was 38 years old and had an unusually checkered
career behind him. He had been an itinerant and generally unsuccessful
lecturer and evangelist, a lawyer, and a would-be politician.
While it is true he resented Garfield’s failure to appoint him consul
in Paris as a reward for his wholly illusory contribution to the Garfield
campaign, and he verbally attacked Garfield for his lack of
support for the so-called Stalwart wing of the Republican Party,
these may not have supplied the total motivation for his crime. At
his trial he testified that the “Deity” had commanded him to remove
the President. There is no evidence that he confided his assassination
plans to anyone or that he had any close friends or confidants.
He made his attack on the President under circumstances where escape
after the shooting was inconceivable. There were some hereditary
mental problems in his family and Guiteau apparently believed in
divine inspiration.<a id="FNanchor_A7-17" href="#Footnote_A7-17" class="fnanchor">A7-17</a></p>

<p>Guiteau later testified that he had had three opportunities to attack
the President prior to the actual shooting. On all of these occasions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
within a brief period of 3 weeks, the President was unguarded. Guiteau
finally realized his intent on the morning of July 2, 1881. As
Garfield was walking to a train in the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad
Station in Washington, Guiteau stepped up and shot him in the
back. Garfield did not die from the effects of the wound until September
19, 1881. Although there was evidence of serious abnormality
in Guiteau, he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to be hanged.
The execution took place on June 30, 1882.<a id="FNanchor_A7-18" href="#Footnote_A7-18" class="fnanchor">A7-18</a></p>

<p>At least one newspaper, the New York Tribune, predicted that the
assault on Garfield would lead to the President becoming “the slave
of his office, the prisoner of forms and restrictions,” in sharp and
unwelcome contrast to the splendidly simple life he had been able to
live before.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The bullet of the assassin who lurked in the Washington railway
station to take the life of President Garfield shattered the
simple Republican manner of life which the custom of nearly a
century has prescribed for the Chief Magistrate of the United
States. Our Presidents have been the first citizens of the Republic—nothing
more. With a measure of power in their hands far
greater than is wielded by the ruler of any limited monarchy in
Europe, they have never surrounded themselves with the forms
and safeguards of courts. The White House has been a business
office to everybody. Its occupant has always been more accessible
than the heads of great commercial establishments. When the
passions of the war were at fever heat, Mr. Lincoln used to have
a small guard of cavalry when he rode out to his summer residence
at the Soldier’s Home; but at no other time in our history has
it been thought needful for a President to have any special protection
against violence when inside or outside the White House.
Presidents have driven about Washington like other people and
travelled over the country as unguarded and unconstrained as any
private citizen.<a id="FNanchor_A7-19" href="#Footnote_A7-19" class="fnanchor">A7-19</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The prediction of the Tribune did not come to pass. Although the
Nation was shocked by this deed, its representatives took no steps to
provide the President with personal protection. The President continued
to move about Washington, sometimes completely alone, and
to travel without special protection. There is a story that President
Chester A. Arthur, Garfield’s successor, once went to a ceremony at
the Washington Navy Yard on a public conveyance that he hailed in
front of the White House.<a id="FNanchor_A7-20" href="#Footnote_A7-20" class="fnanchor">A7-20</a></p>

<p>During Grover Cleveland’s second administration (1893-97) the
number of threatening letters addressed to the President increased
markedly, and Mrs. Cleveland persuaded the President to increase
the number of White House policemen to 27 from the 3 who had constituted
the force since the Civil War. In 1894, the Secret Service
began to provide protection, on an informal basis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span><a id="FNanchor_A7-21" href="#Footnote_A7-21" class="fnanchor">A7-21</a></p>

<p>The Secret Service was organized as a division of the Department
of the Treasury in 1865, to deal with counterfeiting.<a id="FNanchor_A7-22" href="#Footnote_A7-22" class="fnanchor">A7-22</a> Its jurisdiction
was extended to other fiscal crimes against the United States in
later appropriations acts,<a id="FNanchor_A7-23" href="#Footnote_A7-23" class="fnanchor">A7-23</a> but its early work in assisting in protecting
the President was an unofficial, stopgap response to a need for a
trained organization, with investigative capabilities, to perform this
task. In 1894, while investigating a plot by a group of gamblers in
Colorado to assassinate President Cleveland, the Secret Service assigned
a small detail of operatives to the White House to help protect
him. Secret Service men accompanied the President and his family
to their vacation home in Massachusetts; special details protected the
President in Washington, on trips, and at special functions.<a id="FNanchor_A7-24" href="#Footnote_A7-24" class="fnanchor">A7-24</a> For a
time, two agents rode in a buggy behind President Cleveland’s carriage,
but this practice attracted so much attention in the opposition
newspapers that it was soon discontinued at the President’s insistence.<a id="FNanchor_A7-25" href="#Footnote_A7-25" class="fnanchor">A7-25</a>
These initially informal and part-time arrangements eventually
led to the organization of permanent systematic protection for
the President and his family.</p>

<p>During the Spanish-American War the Secret Service stationed a
detail at the White House to provide continuous protection for President
McKinley. The special wartime protective measures were relaxed
after the war, but Secret Service guards remained on duty at
the White House at least part of the time.<a id="FNanchor_A7-26" href="#Footnote_A7-26" class="fnanchor">A7-26</a></p>

<p>Between 1894 and 1900, anarchists murdered the President of
France, the Premier of Spain, the Empress of Austria, and the King
of Italy. At the turn of the century the Secret Service thought that
the strong police action taken against the anarchists in Europe was
compelling them to flee and that many were coming to the United
States. Concerned about the protection of the President, the Secret
Service increased the number of guards and directed that a guard
accompany him on all of his trips.<a id="FNanchor_A7-27" href="#Footnote_A7-27" class="fnanchor">A7-27</a></p>

<p>Unlike Lincoln and Garfield, President McKinley was being
guarded when he was shot by Leon F. Czolgosz, an American-born
28-year-old factory worker and farmhand. On September 6, 1901,
the President was holding a brief reception for the public in the
Temple of Music at the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo.
Long lines of people passed between two rows of policemen and
soldiers to reach the President and shake his hand. In the immediate
vicinity of the President were four Buffalo detectives, four soldiers,
and three Secret Service agents. Two of the Secret Service men
were facing the President at a distance of 3 feet. One of them stated
later that it was normally his custom to stand at the side of the President
on such occasions, but that he had been requested not to do so at
this time in order to permit McKinley’s secretary and the president of
the exposition to stand on either side of McKinley. Czolgosz joined
the line, concealed a pistol under a handkerchief, and when he stood
in front of the President shot twice through the handkerchief.
McKinley fell critically wounded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span><a id="FNanchor_A7-28" href="#Footnote_A7-28" class="fnanchor">A7-28</a></p>

<p>Czolgosz, a self-styled anarchist, did not believe in rulers of any
kind. There is evidence that the organized anarchists in the U.S.A.
did not accept or trust him. He was not admitted as a member to
any of the secret anarchist societies. No co-plotters were ever discovered,
and there is no evidence that he had confided in anyone. A
calm inquiry made by two eminent alienists about a year after
Czolgosz was executed found that Czolgosz had for some time been
suffering from delusions. One was that he was an anarchist; another
was that it was his duty to assassinate the President.<a id="FNanchor_A7-29" href="#Footnote_A7-29" class="fnanchor">A7-29</a></p>

<p>The assassin said he had no grudge against the President personally
but did not believe in the republican form of government or in rulers
of any kind. In his written confession he included the words, “‘I
don’t believe one man should have so much service and another man
should have none.’” As he was strapped to the chair to be electrocuted,
he said: “‘I killed the President because he was the enemy of
the good people—the good working people. I am not sorry for my
crime.’”<a id="FNanchor_A7-30" href="#Footnote_A7-30" class="fnanchor">A7-30</a></p>

<p>McKinley lingered on for 8 days before he died of blood poisoning
early on the morning of September 14. Czolgosz, who had been
captured immediately, was swiftly tried, convicted, and condemned
to death. Although it seemed to some contemporaries that Czolgosz
was incompetent, the defense made no effort to plead insanity.
Czolgosz was executed 45 days after the President’s death. Investigations
by the Buffalo police and the Secret Service revealed no accomplices
and no plot of any kind.<a id="FNanchor_A7-31" href="#Footnote_A7-31" class="fnanchor">A7-31</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr188">DEVELOPMENT OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION</h3>

<p>This third assassination of a President in a little more than a
generation—it was only 36 years since Lincoln had been killed—shook
the nation and aroused it to a greater awareness of the uniqueness
of the Presidency and the grim hazards that surrounded an incumbent
of that Office. The first congressional session after the assassination
of McKinley gave more attention to legislation concerning
attacks on the President than had any previous Congress but did
not pass any measures for the protection of the President.<a id="FNanchor_A7-32" href="#Footnote_A7-32" class="fnanchor">A7-32</a> Nevertheless,
in 1902 the Secret Service, which was then the only Federal
general investigative agency of any consequence, assumed full-time
responsibility for the safety of the President. Protection of the
President now became one of its major permanent functions, and it
assigned two men to its original full-time White House detail. Additional
agents were provided when the President traveled or went on
vacation.<a id="FNanchor_A7-33" href="#Footnote_A7-33" class="fnanchor">A7-33</a></p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt, who was the first President to experience the
extensive system of protection that has surrounded the President ever
since, voiced an opinion of Presidential protection that was probably
shared in part by most of his successors. In a letter to Senator Henry
Cabot Lodge in 1906, from his summer home, he wrote:</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Secret Service men are a very small but very necessary
thorn in the flesh. Of course, they would not be the least use in
preventing any assault upon my life. I do not believe there is
any danger of such an assault, and if there were, as Lincoln said,
“though it would be safer for a President to live in a cage, it
would interfere with his business.” But it is only the Secret
Service men who render life endurable, as you would realize if
you saw the procession of carriages that pass through the place,
the procession of people on foot who try to get into the place, not
to speak of the multitude of cranks and others who are stopped
in the village.<a id="FNanchor_A7-34" href="#Footnote_A7-34" class="fnanchor">A7-34</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Roosevelt, who had succeeded to the Presidency because of an assassin’s
bullet, himself became the object of an assassination attempt a
few years after he left office and when he was no longer under Secret
Service protection. During the Presidential campaign of 1912, just
as he was about to make a political speech in Milwaukee on October 14,
he was shot and wounded in the breast by John N. Schrank, a 36-year-old
German-born ex-tavern keeper. A folded manuscript of his
long speech and the metal case for his eyeglasses in the breast pocket
of Roosevelt’s coat were all that prevented the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_A7-35" href="#Footnote_A7-35" class="fnanchor">A7-35</a></p>

<p>Schrank had had a vision in 1901, induced possibly by McKinley’s
assassination, which took on meaning for him after Roosevelt, 11
years later, started to campaign for the Presidency. In this vision
the ghost of McKinley appeared to him and told him not to let a
murderer (i.e., Roosevelt, who according to the vision had murdered
McKinley) become President. It was then that he determined upon
the assassination. At the bidding of McKinley’s ghost, he felt he
had no choice but to kill Theodore Roosevelt. After his attempt on
Roosevelt, Schrank was found to be insane and was committed to
mental hospitals in Wisconsin for the rest of his life.<a id="FNanchor_A7-36" href="#Footnote_A7-36" class="fnanchor">A7-36</a></p>

<p>The establishment and extension of the Secret Service authority
for protection was a prolonged process. Although the Secret Service
undertook to provide full-time protection for the President beginning
in 1902, it received neither funds for the purpose nor sanction from
the Congress until 1906 when the Sundry Civil Expenses Act for
1907 included funds for protection of the President by the Secret
Service.<a id="FNanchor_A7-37" href="#Footnote_A7-37" class="fnanchor">A7-37</a> Following the election of William Howard Taft in 1908,
the Secret Service began providing protection for the President-elect.
This practice received statutory authorization in 1913, and in
the same year, Congress authorized permanent protection of the
President.<a id="FNanchor_A7-38" href="#Footnote_A7-38" class="fnanchor">A7-38</a> It remained necessary to renew the authority annually
in the Appropriations Acts until 1951.</p>

<p>As in the Civil and Spanish-American Wars, the coming of war in
1917 caused increased concern for the safety of the President. Congress
enacted a law, since referred to as the threat statute, making
it a crime to threaten the President by mail or in any other manner.<a id="FNanchor_A7-39" href="#Footnote_A7-39" class="fnanchor">A7-39</a>
In 1917 Congress also authorized protection for the President’s immediate
family by the Secret Service.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span><a id="FNanchor_A7-40" href="#Footnote_A7-40" class="fnanchor">A7-40</a></p>

<p>As the scope of the Presidency expanded during the 20th century,
the Secret Service found the problems of protection becoming more
numerous. In 1906, for the first time in history, a President traveled
outside the United States while in office. When Theodore Roosevelt
visited Panama in that year, he was accompanied and protected by
Secret Service men.<a id="FNanchor_A7-41" href="#Footnote_A7-41" class="fnanchor">A7-41</a> In 1918-19 Woodrow Wilson broadened the
precedent of Presidential foreign travel when he traveled to Europe
with a Secret Service escort of 10 men to attend the Versailles Peace
Conference.<a id="FNanchor_A7-42" href="#Footnote_A7-42" class="fnanchor">A7-42</a></p>

<p>The attempt on the life of President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt
in 1933 further demonstrated the broad scope and complexity of the
protection problems facing the Secret Service. Giuseppe Zangara
was a bricklayer and stonemason with a professed hatred of capitalists
and Presidents. He seemed to be obsessed with the desire to
kill a President. After his arrest he confessed that he had first
planned to go to Washington to kill President Herbert Hoover, but as
the cold climate of the North was bad for his stomach trouble, he was
loath to leave Miami, where he was staying. When he read in the
paper that President-elect Roosevelt would be in Miami, he resolved to
kill him.<a id="FNanchor_A7-43" href="#Footnote_A7-43" class="fnanchor">A7-43</a></p>

<p>On the night of February 15, 1933, at a political rally in Miami’s
Bayfront Park, the President-elect sat on the top of the rear seat of
his automobile with a small microphone in his hand as he made a
short informal talk. Fortunately for him, however, he slid down
into the seat just before Zangara could get near enough to take aim.
The assassin’s arm may have been jogged just as he shot; the five
rounds he directed at Roosevelt went awry. However, he mortally
wounded Mayor Anton Cermak, of Chicago, and hit four other persons;
the President-elect, by a miracle, escaped. Zangara, of course,
never had any chance of escaping.<a id="FNanchor_A7-44" href="#Footnote_A7-44" class="fnanchor">A7-44</a></p>

<p>Zangara was electrocuted on March 20, 1933, only 33 days after his
attempt on Roosevelt. No evidence of accomplices or conspiracy
came to light, but there was some sensational newspaper speculation,
wholly undocumented, that Zangara may have been hired by Chicago
gangsters to kill Cermak.<a id="FNanchor_A7-45" href="#Footnote_A7-45" class="fnanchor">A7-45</a></p>

<p>The force provided since the Civil War by the Washington Metropolitan
Police for the protection of the White House had grown to
54 men by 1922.<a id="FNanchor_A7-46" href="#Footnote_A7-46" class="fnanchor">A7-46</a> In that year Congress enacted legislation creating
the White House Police Force as a separate organization under
the direct control of the President.<a id="FNanchor_A7-47" href="#Footnote_A7-47" class="fnanchor">A7-47</a> This force was actually supervised
by the President’s military aide until 1930, when Congress placed
supervision under the Chief of the Secret Service.<a id="FNanchor_A7-48" href="#Footnote_A7-48" class="fnanchor">A7-48</a> Although Congress
transferred control and supervision of the force to the Secretary
of the Treasury in 1962,<a id="FNanchor_A7-49" href="#Footnote_A7-49" class="fnanchor">A7-49</a> the Secretary delegated supervision to the
Chief of the Secret Service.<a id="FNanchor_A7-50" href="#Footnote_A7-50" class="fnanchor">A7-50</a></p>

<p>The White House detail of the Secret Service grew in size slowly
from the original 2 men assigned in 1902. In 1914 it still numbered
only 5, but during World War I it was increased to 10 men.
Additional men were added when the President traveled. After the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
war the size of the detail grew until it reached 16 agents and 2 supervisors
by 1939. World War II created new and greater protection
problems, especially those arising from the President’s trips abroad to
the Grand Strategy Conferences in such places as Casablanca, Quebec,
Tehran, Cairo, and Yalta. To meet the increased demands, the White
House detail was increased to 37 men early in the war.<a id="FNanchor_A7-51" href="#Footnote_A7-51" class="fnanchor">A7-51</a></p>

<p>The volume of mail received by the White House had always been
large, but it reached huge proportions under Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Presidents had always received threatening letters but never in such
quantities. To deal with this growing problem, the Secret Service
established in 1940 the Protective Research Section to analyze and
make available to those charged with protecting the President,
information from White House mail and other sources concerning
people potentially capable of violence to the President. The Protective
Research Section undoubtedly permitted the Secret Service to anticipate
and forestall many incidents that might have been embarrassing
or harmful to the President.<a id="FNanchor_A7-52" href="#Footnote_A7-52" class="fnanchor">A7-52</a></p>

<p>Although there was no advance warning of the attempt on Harry S.
Truman’s life on November 1, 1950, the protective measures taken by
the Secret Service availed, and the assassins never succeeded in firing
directly at the President. The assassins—Oscar Collazo and Griselio
Torresola, Puerto Rican Nationalists living in New York—tried to
force their way into Blair House, at the time the President’s residence
while the White House was being repaired. Blair House was
guarded by White House policemen and Secret Service agents. In
the ensuing gun battle, Torresola and one White House policeman
were killed, and Collazo and two White House policemen were
wounded. Had the assassins succeeded in entering the front door of
Blair House, they would probably have been cut down immediately
by another Secret Service agent inside who kept the doorway covered
with a submachine gun from his vantage point at the foot of the main
stairs. In all, some 27 shots were fired in less than 3 minutes.<a id="FNanchor_A7-53" href="#Footnote_A7-53" class="fnanchor">A7-53</a></p>

<p>Collazo was brought to trial in 1951 and sentenced to death, but
President Truman commuted the sentence to life imprisonment on
July 24, 1952. Although there was a great deal of evidence linking
Collazo and Torresola to the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico and
its leader, Pedro Albizu Campos, the Government could not establish
that the attack on the President was part of a larger Nationalist
conspiracy.<a id="FNanchor_A7-54" href="#Footnote_A7-54" class="fnanchor">A7-54</a></p>

<p>The attack on President Truman led to the enactment in 1951 of
legislation that permanently authorized the Secret Service to protect
the President, his immediate family, the President-elect, and the Vice
President, the last upon his request. Protection of the Vice President
by the Secret Service had begun in January 1945 when Harry S.
Truman occupied the office.<a id="FNanchor_A7-55" href="#Footnote_A7-55" class="fnanchor">A7-55</a></p>

<p>In 1962 Congress further enlarged the list of Government officers
to be safeguarded, authorizing protection of the Vice President (or
the officer next in order of succession to the Presidency) without requiring
his request therefor; of the Vice President-elect; and of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
former President, at his request, for a reasonable period after his
departure from office. The Secret Service considered this “reasonable
period” to be 6 months.<a id="FNanchor_A7-56" href="#Footnote_A7-56" class="fnanchor">A7-56</a></p>

<p>Amendments to the threat statute of 1917, passed in 1955 and 1962,
made it a crime to threaten to harm the President-elect, the Vice President,
or other officers next in succession to either office. The President’s
immediate family was not included in the threat statute.<a id="FNanchor_A7-57" href="#Footnote_A7-57" class="fnanchor">A7-57</a></p>

<p>Congressional concern regarding the uses to which the President
might put the Secret Service—first under Theodore Roosevelt and
subsequently under Woodrow Wilson—caused Congress to place tight
restrictions on the functions of the Service and the uses of its funds.<a id="FNanchor_A7-58" href="#Footnote_A7-58" class="fnanchor">A7-58</a>
The restrictions probably prevented the Secret Service from developing
into a general investigative agency, leaving the field open for
some other agency when the need arose. The other agency proved to
be the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), established within the
Department of Justice in 1908.<a id="FNanchor_A7-59" href="#Footnote_A7-59" class="fnanchor">A7-59</a></p>

<p>The FBI grew rapidly in the 1920’s, and especially in the 1930’s
and after, establishing itself as the largest, best equipped, and best
known of all U.S. Government investigative agencies. In the appropriations
of the FBI there recurred annually an item for the “protection
of the person of the President of the United States,” that had
first appeared in the appropriation of the Department of Justice in
1910 under the heading “Miscellaneous Objects.”<a id="FNanchor_A7-60" href="#Footnote_A7-60" class="fnanchor">A7-60</a> But there is no
evidence that the Justice Department ever exercised any direct responsibility
for the protection of the President. Although it had no prescribed
protection functions, according to its Director, J. Edgar
Hoover, the FBI did provide protection to Vice President Charles
Curtis at his request, when he was serving under Herbert Hoover from
1929 to 1933. Over the years the FBI contribution to Presidential protection
was confined chiefly to the referral to the Secret Service of the
names of people who might be potentially dangerous to the President.<a id="FNanchor_A7-61" href="#Footnote_A7-61" class="fnanchor">A7-61</a></p>

<p>In recent years the Secret Service has remained a small and specialized
bureau, restricted to very limited functions prescribed by Congress.
In 1949, a task force of the Commission on Organization of
the Executive Branch of the Government (Hoover Commission),
recommended nonfiscal functions be removed from the Treasury Department.<a id="FNanchor_A7-62" href="#Footnote_A7-62" class="fnanchor">A7-62</a>
The recommendation called for transfer of the White
House detail, White House Police Force, and Treasury Guard Force
from the Secret Service to the Department of Justice. The final report
of the Commission on the Treasury Department omitted this recommendation,
leaving the protective function with the Secret Service.<a id="FNanchor_A7-63" href="#Footnote_A7-63" class="fnanchor">A7-63</a>
At a meeting of the Commission, ex-President Hoover, in a reference
to the proposed transfer, expressed the opinion that “the President
will object to having a ‘private eye’ looking after these fellows and
would rather continue with the service.”<a id="FNanchor_A7-64" href="#Footnote_A7-64" class="fnanchor">A7-64</a></p>

<p>In 1963 the Secret Service was one of several investigative agencies
in the Treasury Department. Its major functions were to combat
counterfeiting and to protect the President, his family, and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
designated persons.<a id="FNanchor_A7-65" href="#Footnote_A7-65" class="fnanchor">A7-65</a> The Chief of the Secret Service administered
its activities through four divisions: Investigation, Inspection, Administrative,
and Security, and 65 field offices throughout the country,
each under a special agent in charge who reported directly to Washington.
The Security Division supervised the White House detail,
the White House Police, and the Treasury Guard Force. During
fiscal year 1963 (July 1, 1962-June 30, 1963) the Secret Service had
an average strength of 513, of whom 351 were special agents. Average
strength of the White House Police during the year was 179.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span><a id="FNanchor_A7-66" href="#Footnote_A7-66" class="fnanchor">A7-66</a></p>

SUMMARY</p>

<p>The President arrived at the Emergency Room at
12:43 P.M., the 22nd of November, 1963. He was in the
back seat of his limousine. Governor Connally of Texas
was also in this car. The first physician to see the
President was Dr. James Carrico, a Resident in General
Surgery.</p>

<p>Dr. Carrico noted the President to have slow,
agonal respiratory efforts. He could hear a heartbeat
but found no pulse or blood pressure to be present.
Two external wounds, one in the lower third of the anterior
neck, the other in the occipital region of the
skull, were noted. Through the head wound, blood and
brain were extruding. Dr. Carrico inserted a cuffed
endotracheal tube. While doing so, he noted a ragged
wound of the trachea immediately below the larynx.</p>

<p>At this time, Dr. Malcolm Perry, Attending Surgeon,
Dr. Charles Baxter, Attending Surgeon, and Dr.
Ronald Jones, another Resident in General Surgery,
arrived. Immediately thereafter, Dr. M. T. Jenkins,
Director of the Department of Anesthesia, and Doctors
Giesecke and Bunt, two other Staff Anesthesiologists,
arrived. The endotracheal tube had been connected to a
Bennett respirator to assist the President’s breathing.
An Anesthesia machine was substituted for this by Dr.
Jenkins. Only 100% oxygen was administered.</p>

<p>A cutdown was performed in the right ankle, and
a polyethylene catheter inserted in the vein. An infusion
of lactated Ringer’s solution was begun. Blood
was drawn for type and crossmatch, but unmatched type
“O” RH negative blood was immediately obtained and begun.
Hydrocortisone 300 mgms was added to the intravenous fluids.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert McClelland, Attending Surgeon, arrived
to help in the President’s care. Doctors Perry, Baxter,
and McClelland began a tracheostomy, as considerable quantities
of blood were present from the President’s oral
pharynx. At this time, Dr. Paul Peters, Attending Urological
Surgeon, and Dr. Kemp Clark, Director of Neurological
Surgery, arrived. Because of the lacerated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
trachea, anterior chest tubes were placed in both pleural
spaces. These were connected to sealed underwater drainage.</p>

<p>Neurological examination revealed the President’s
pupils to be widely dilated and fixed to light. His eyes
were divergent, being deviated outward; a skew deviation
from the horizontal was present. No deep tendon reflexes
or spontaneous movements were found.</p>

<p>There was a large wound in the right occipito-parietal
region, from which profuse bleeding was occurring.
1500 cc. of blood were estimated on the drapes
and floors of the Emergency Operating Room. There was
considerable loss of scalp and bone tissue. Both cerebral
and cerabellar tissue were extruding from the wound.</p>

<p>Further examination was not possible as cardiac
arrest occurred at this point. Closed chest cardiac
massage was begun by Dr. Clark. A pulse palpable in both
the carotid and femoral arteries was obtained. Dr. Perry
relieved on the cardiac massage while a cardiotachioscope
was connected. Dr. Fouad Bashour, Attending Physician,
arrived as this was being connected. There was electrical
silence of the President’s heart.</p>

<p>President Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1300
hours by Dr. Clark.</p>

<p class="p2 in0">Upon receiving a stat alarm that this distinguished patient was being brought to
the emergency room at Parkland Memorial Hospital, I dispatched Doctors A. H.
Giesecke and Jackie H. Hunt with an anesthesia machine and resuscitative equipment
to the major surgical emergency room area, and I ran down the stairs. On my
arrival in the emergency operating room at approximately 1230 I found that Doctors
Carrico and/or Delaney had begun resuscitative efforts by introducing an orotracheal
tube, connecting it for controlled ventilation to a Bennett intermittent positive
pressure breathing apparatus. Doctors Charles Baxter, Malcolm Perry, and Robert
McClelland arrived at the same time and began a tracheostomy and started the
insertion of a right chest tube, since there was also obvious tracheal and chest
damage. Doctors Paul Peters and Kemp Clark arrived simultaneously and immediately
thereafter assisted respectively with the insertion of the right chest tube and
with manual closed chest cardiac compression to assure circulation.</p>

<p class="in0">For better control of artificial ventilation, I exchanged the intermittent positive
pressure breathing apparatus for an anesthesia machine and continued artificial
ventilation. Doctors Gene Akin and A. H. Giesecke assisted with the respiratory
problems incident to changing from the orotracheal tube to a tracheostomy tube, and
Doctors Hunt and Giesecke connected a cardioscope to determine cardiac activity.</p>

<p class="in0">During the progress of these activities, the emergency room cart was elevated at the
feet in order to provide a Trendelenburg position, a venous cutdown was performed on
the right saphenous vein, and additional fluids were begun in a vein in the left
forearm while blood was ordered from the blood bank. All of these activities were
completed by approximately 1245, at which time external cardiac massage was still
being carried out effectively by Doctor Clark as judged by a palpable peripheral
pulse. Despite these measures there was no electrocardiographic evidence of cardiac
activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span></p>

<p class="in0">These described resuscitative activities were indicated as of first importance,
and after they were carried out attention was turned to all other evidences of
injury. There was a great laceration on the right side of the head (temporal
and occipital), causing a great defect in the skull plate so that there was
herniation and laceration of great areas of the brain, even to the extent that
the cerebellum had protruded from the wound. There were also fragmented sections
of brain on the drapes of the emergency room cart. With the institution of
adequate cardiac compression, there was a great flow of blood from the cranial
cavity, indicating that there was much vascular damage as well as brain tissue
damage.</p>

<p class="in0">It is my personal feeling that all methods of resuscitation were instituted
expeditiously and efficiently. However, this cranial and intracranial damage
was of such magnitude as to cause the irreversible damage. President Kennedy
was pronounced dead at 1300.</p>

M. T. Jenkins, M.D.

<p><span class="sans">Clinical Evaluation:</span> The patient was brought to the OR from the EOR. In the EOR a sucking wound
of the right chest was partially controlled by an occlusive dressing supported by manual
pressure. A tube had been placed through the second interspace in the mid-clavicular line
connected to a waterseal bottle to evacuate the right pneumothorax and hemathorax. An IV
infusion of RL solution had already been started. As soon as the patient was positioned on
the OR table the anesthesia was Induced by Dr. Giesecke and an endotracheal tube was in
place. As soon as it was possible to control respiration with positive pressure the occlusive
dressing was taken from the right chest and the extent of the wound more carefully
determined. It was found that the wound of entrance was just lateral to the right scapula
close the the axilla yet had passed through the latysmus dorsi muscle shattered approximately
ten cm of the lateral and anterior portion of the right fifth rib and emerged below
the right nipple. The wound of entrance was approximately three cm in its longest diameter
and the wound of exit was a ragged wound approximately five cm in its greatest diameter.
The skin and subcutaneous tissue over the path of the missile moved in a paradoxical
manner with respiration indicating softening of the chest. The skin of the whole area
was carefully cleansed with Phisohex and Iodine. The entire area including the wound of
entrance and wound of exit was draped partially excluding the wound of entrance for the
first part of the operation. An elliptical incision was made around the wound of exit removing
the torn edges of the skin and the damaged subcutaneous tissue. The incision was
then carried in a downward curve up toward the right axilla so as to not have the skin incision
over the actual path of the missile ban through the chest wall. This incision was
carried down through the subcutaneous tissue to expose the Serratus anterior muscle and the
anterior border of the latissimus dorsi muscle. The fragmented and damaged portions of the
Serratus anterior muscle were excised. Small rib fragments that were adhering to periosteal
tags were carefully removed preserving as much periosteum as possible. The fourth
intercostal muscle bundle and fifth intercostal muscle bundle
were not appreciably damaged.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
The ragged ends of the damaged fifth rib were cleaned
out with the rongeur. The plura had been torn open by the secondary missiles created by
the fragmented fifth rib. The wound was open widely and exposure was obtained with a self
retaining retractor. The right plural cavity was then carefully inspected. Approximately
200 cc of clot and liquid blood was removed from the pleural cavity. The middle lobe had
a linear rent starting at its peripheral edge going down towards itshilum separating the
lobe into two segments. There was an open bronchus in the depth of this wound. Since the
vascularlty and the bronchial connections to the lobe were intact it was decided to repair
the lobe rather then to remove it. The repair was accomplished with a running suture
of #000 chromic gut on atraumatic needle closing both plural surfaces as well as two runnin
sutures approximating the tissue of the central portion of the lobe. This almost completely
sealed off the air leaks which were evident in the torn portion of the lobe. The lower
lobe was next examined and found to be engorged with blood and at one point a laceration of
allowed the oozing of blood. This laceration had undoubtedly been caused by a rib fragment.
This laceration was closed with a single suture of #3-O chromic gut on atraumatic needle.
The right pleural cavity was now carefully examined and small ribs fragments were removed,
the diaphram was found to be uninjured. There was no evidence of injury of the mediastinum
and its contents. Hemostasis had been accomplished within the plural cavity with the repair
of the middle lobe and the suturing of the laceration in the lower lobe. The upper lobe was
found to be uninjured. The drains which had previously been placed in the second interspace
in the midclavicular line was found to be longer than necessary so approximately ten cm
of it was cut away and the remaining portion was demonstrated with two additional openings.
An additional drain was placed through a stab wound in the eighth interspace in the posterior
axillary line. Both these drains were then connected to a waterseal bottle. The
fourth and fifth intercostal muscles were then approximated with interrupted sutures of #O
chromic gut. The remaining portion of the Serratus anterior muscle was then approximated
across the closure of the intercostal muscle. The laceration of the latissimus dorsi muscle
on its intermost surface was then closed with several interrupted sutures of #O chromic
gut. <span class="strike">The subcutaneous tissue was th</span> Before closing the subcutaneous tissue one million units
of Penicillin and one gram of Streptomycin in 100 cc normal saline was instilled into the
wound. The stab wound was then made in the most dependent portion of the wound coming out
near the angle of the scapula. A large Penrose drain was drawn out through this stab wound
to allow drainage of the wound of the chest wall. The subcutaneous tissue was then closed with
interrupted #O chromic gut inverting the knots. Skin closed with interrupted vertical mattress sutures
of black silk. Attention was next turned to the wound of entrance. It was excised with
an elliptical incision. It was found that the latissimus dorsi muscle although lacerated
was not badly damaged so that the opening was closed with sutures of #O chromic gut in the
fascia of the muscle. Before closing this incision <span class="strike">the</span> palpation with the index finger the
Penrose drain could be felt immediately below in the space beneath the latissimus dorsi
muscle. The skin closed with interrupted vertical mattress sutures of black silk. Drainage
tubes were secured with safety pens and adhesive tape and dressings applied. As soon as the
operation on the chest had been concluded Dr. Gregory and Dr. Shires started the surgery that
was necessary for the wounds of the right wrist and left thigh.</p>

<p>* There was also a comminuted fracture of the right radius secondary to the same missile
and in addition a small flesh wound of the left thigh. The operative notes concerning the
management of the right arm and left thigh will be dictated by Dr. Charles Gregory and Dr. Tom
Shires.</p>

<p>(handwritten: also a partial transection of the superficial radial nerve or Ext. Pol Brevis)</p>

<p><span class="sans">CLINICAL EVALUATION:</span> While still under general anesthesia and following a thoracotomy and repair
of the chest injury by Dr. Robert Shaw, the right upper extremity was thoroughly
prepped in the routine fashion after shaving. he was draped in the routine fashion using
stockinette, the only addition was the use of a debridement pan. The wound of entry on the
dorsal aspect of the right wrist over the junction of the distal fourth of the radius and
shaft was approximately two cm in length and rather oblique with the loss of tissue with
some considerable contusion at the margins of it. There was a wound of exit along the volar
surface of the wrist about two cm above the flexion crease of the wrist and in the midline.
The wound of entrance was carefully excised and developed through the muscles and tendons
from the radial side of the bone to the bone itself where the fracture was encountered.
It was noted that the tendon of the abductor palmaris longus was transected, only two small
fragments of bone <span class="strike">was</span> were removed, one approximately one cm in length and consisted of lateral
cortex which lay free in the wound and had no soft tissue connections, another much smaller
fragment perhaps 3 mm in length was subsequently removed. Small bits of metal were encountered
at various levels throughout the wound and these were wherever they were identified
and could be picked up were picked up and have been submitted to the Pathology department
for identification and examination. Throughout the wound <span class="strike">it was not</span> and especially
in the superficial layers and to some extent in the tendon and tendon sheaths on the radial
side of the arm small fine bits of cloth consistent with fine bits of Mohair. It is
our understanding that the patient was wearing a Mohair suit at the time of the injury and
this accounts for the deposition of such organic material within the wound. After as careful
and complete a debridement as could be carried out and with an apparent integrity of the
flexor tendons and the median nerve in the volar side, and after thorough irrigation the
wound of exit on the volar surface of the wrist was closed primarily with wire sutures
while the wound of entrance on the radial side of the forearm was only partially closed
being left open for the purpose of drainage should any make
spontaneous appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
This is because of the presence of Mohair and
organic material deep into the wound which is prone to produce tissue reactions and to encourage
infection and this precaution of not closing the wound was taken in correspondence
with our experience in that regard.</p>

<p>In view of the urgency of the Governor’s original chest injury it was impossible to
definitely ascertain the status of the circulation and the nerve supply to the hand and
wrist on the right side. Accordingly, it was determined as best we could at the time of
operation and the radial artery was found to be intact and pulsating normally. The integrity
of the median nerve and the ulnar nerve is not clearly established but it is presumed
to be present. Following closure of the volar wound and partial closure of the radial
wound, dry sterile dressings were applied and a long arm cast was then applied with skin
tape traction, rubber band variety, attached to the thumb and index finger of the right
hand. <span class="strike">The-righ</span> An attitude of flexon was created at the right elbow, and post operatively
the limbus suspended from an overhead frame using tape traction. The post operative diagnosis
for the right forearm remains the same and again I suggest that you incorporate this
particular dictation together with other dictations which will be given to you by the
surgeons concerned with this patient.</p>

<p><span class="sans">COMPLICATIONS:</span> *This portion of the operation is involved only with the operation on
the left thigh. The chest injury has been dictated by Dr. Shaw, the
orthopedic injury to the arm by Dr. Gregory.</p>

<p><span class="sans">CONDITION OF PATIENT:</span></p>

<p><span class="sans">CLINICAL EVALUATION:</span> There was a 1 cm. punctate missile wound over the juncture of the
middle and lower third, medial aspect, of the left thigh. X-rays of
the thigh and leg revealed a bullet fragment which was imbedded
in the body of the femur in the distal third. The leg was prepared
with Phisohex and I.O. Prep and was draped in the usual fashion.</p>

<p>Following this the missile wound was excised and the bullet
tract was explored. The missile wound was seen to course through
the subcutaneous fat and into the vastus medialis. The necrotic fat
and muscle were debrided down to the region of the femur. The
direction of the missile wound was judged not to be in the course of
the femoral vessel, since the wound was distal and anterior to
Hunter’s canal. Following complete debridement of the wound and irrigation
with saline, the wound was felt to be adequately debrided enough
so that three simple through-and-through, stainless steel Aloe #28 wire
sutures were used encompassing skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle
fascia on both sides. Following this a sterile dressing was applied.
The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses in both lags were quite
good. The thoracic procedure had been completed at this time, the
debridement of the compound fracture in the arm was still in progress
at the time this soft tissue injury repair was completed.</p>

<p><span class="sans">CLINICAL EVALUATION:</span> Previous inspection had revealed an entrance wound over the left lower
lateral chest cage, and an exit was identified by subcutaneous palpation of the bullet
over the right lower lateral chest cage. At the time he was seen preoperatively he
was without blood pressure, heart beat was heard infrequently at 130 beats per minute,
And preoperatively had endotracheal tube placed and was receiving oxygen by anesthesia
at the time he was moved to the operating room.</p>

<p><span class="sans">DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:</span> Under endotracheal oxygen anesthesia, a long mid-line abdominal
incision was made. Bleeders were not apparent and none were clamped or tied. Upon
opening the peritoneal cavity, approximately 2 to 3 liters of blood, both liquid
and in clots, were encountered. These were removed. The bullet pathway was then
identified as having shattered the upper medial surface of the spleen, then entered
the retroperitoneal area where there was a large retroperitoneal hematoma in the
area of the pancreas. Following this, bleeding was seen to be coming from the right
side, and upon inspection there was seen to be an exit to the right through the
inferior vena cava, thence through the superior pole of the right kidney, the lower
portion of the right lobe of the liver, and into the right lateral body wall. First
the right kidney, which was bleeding, was identified, dissected free, retracted
immediately, and the inferior vena cava hole was clamped with a partial occlusion
clamp of the Satinsky type. Following this immobilization, packing controlled the
bleeding from the right kidney. Attention was then turned to the left, as bleeding
was massive from the left side. The inspection of the retroperitoneal area revealed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>a huge hematoma in the mid-line. The spleen was then mobilized, as was the left
colon, and the retroperitoneal approach was made to the mid-line structures.
The pancreas was seen to be shattered in its mid portion, bleeding was seen to
be coming from the aorta. This was dissected free. Bleeding was controlled with
finger pressure by Dr. Malcolm O. Perry. Upon identification of this injury, the
superior mesenteric artery had been sheared off of the aorta, there was back
bleeding from the superior mesenteric artery. This was cross-clamped with a
small, curved DeBakey clamp. The aorta was then occluded with a straight DeBakey
clamp above and a Potts clamp below. At this point all major bleeding was controlled,
blood pressure was reported to be in the neighborhood of 100 systolic.
Shortly thereafter, however, the pulse rate, which had been in the 80 to 90 range,
was found to be 40 and a few seconds later found to be zero. No pulse was felt
in the aorta at this time. Consequently the left chest was opened through an
intercostal incision in approximately the fourth intercostal space. A Finochietto
retractor was inserted, the heart was seen to be flabby and not beating at all.
There was no hemopericardium. There was a hole in the diaphragm but no hemothorax.
A left closed chest tube had been introduced in the Emergency Room
prior to surgery, so that there was no significant pneumothorax on the left side.
The pericardium was opened, cardiac massage was started, and a pulse was
obtainable with massage. The heart was flabby, consequently calcium chloride
followed by epinephrine-Xylocaine® were injected into the left ventricle without
success. However, the standstill was converted to fibrillation. Following
this, defibrillation was done, using 240, 360, 500, and 750 volts and finally
successful defibrillation was accomplished. However, no effective heart beat
could be instituted. A pacemaker was then inserted into the wall of the right
ventricle and grounded on skin, and pacemaking was started. A very feeble,
small, localized muscular response was obtained with the pacemaker but still no
effective beat. At this time we were informed by Dr. Jenkins that there were
no signs of life in that the pupils were fixed and dilated, there was no retinal
blood flow, no respiratory effort, and no effective pulse could be maintained
even with cardiac massage. The patient was pronounced dead at 1:07 P.M.
Anesthesia consisted entirely of oxygen. No anesthetic agents as such were
administered. The patient was never conscious from the time of his arrival in
the Emergency Room until his death at 1:07 P.M. The subcutaneous bullet was
extracted from the right side during the attempts at defibrillation, which were
rotated among the surgeons. The cardiac massage and defibrillation attempts
were carried out by Dr. Robert N. McClelland, Dr. Malcolm O. Perry, Dr. Ronald
Jones. Assistance was obtained from the cardiologist, Dr. Fouad Bashour.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">CLINICAL SUMMARY:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">According</span> to available information the
deceased, President John F. Kennedy,
was riding in an open car in a motorcade during an official visit to Dallas, Texas
on 22 November 1963. The President was sitting in the right rear seat with Mrs.
Kennedy seated on the same seat to his left. Sitting directly in front of the
President was Governor John B. Connolly of Texas and directly in front of Mrs. Kennedy
sat Mrs. Connolly. The vehicle was moving at a slow rate of speed down an incline
into an underpass that leads to a freeway route to the Dallas Trade Mart where the
President was to deliver an address.</p>

<p><span class="in40">Three</span> shots were heard and the President
fell forward bleeding from the head. (Governor Connolly was seriously wounded by the
same gunfire.) According to newspaper reports (“Washington Post” November 23, 1963)
Bob Jackson, a Dallas “Times Herald” Photographer, said he looked around as he heard
the shots and saw a rifle barrel disappearing into a window on an upper floor of the
nearby Texas School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p><span class="in40">Shortly</span> following the wounding of the two
men the car was driven to Parkland Hospital in Dallas. In the emergency room of that
hospital the President was attended by Dr. Malcolm Perry. Telephone communication with
Dr. Perry on November 23, 1963 develops the following information relative to the observations
made by Dr. Perry and procedures performed there prior to death.</p>

<p><span class="in40">Dr. Perry</span> noted the massive wound of the
head and a second much smaller wound of the low anterior neck in approximately the
midline. A tracheostomy was performed by extending the latter wound. At this point
bloody air was noted bubbling from the wound and an injury to the right lateral wall
of the trachea was observed. Incisions were made in the upper anterior chest wall
bilaterally to combat possible subcutaneous emphysema. Intravenous infusions of blood
and saline were begun and oxygen was administered. Despite these measures cardiac
arrest occurred and closed chest cardiac massage failed to re-establish cardiac action.
The President was pronounced dead approximately thirty to forty minutes after receiving
his wounds.</p>

<p><span class="in40">The</span> remains were transported via the
Presidential plane to Washington, D.C. and subsequently to the Naval Medical School,
National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland for postmortem examination.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF BODY:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">The</span> body is that of a muscular, well-developed
and well nourished adult Caucasian
male measuring 72½ inches and weighing approximately 170 pounds. There is beginning
rigor mortis, minimal dependent livor mortis of the dorsum, and early algor mortis. The
hair is reddish brown and abundant, the eyes are blue, the right pupil measuring 8 mm.
in diameter, the left 4 mm. There is edema and ecchymosis of the inner canthus region
of the left eyelid measuring approximately 1.5 cm. in greatest diameter. There is edema
and ecchymosis diffusely over the right supra-orbital ridge with abnormal mobility of
the underlying bone. (The remainder of the scalp will be described with the skull.)

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>

There is clotted blood on the external ears but otherwise the ears, nares, and mouth
are essentially unremarkable. The teeth are in excellent repair and there is some
pallor of the oral mucous membrane.</p>

<p><span class="in40">Situated</span> on the upper right posterior
thorax just above the upper border of the scapula there is a 7 x 4 millimeter oval
wound. This wound is measured to be 14 cm. from the tip of the right acromion process
and 14 cm. below the tip of the right mastoid process.</p>

<p>Situated in the low anterior neck at approximately
the level of the third and fourth tracheal rings is a 6.5 cm. long transverse
wound with widely gaping irregular edges. (The depth and character of these
wounds will be further described below.)</p>

<p><span class="in40">Situated</span> on the anterior chest wall in the
nipple line are bilateral 2 cm. long recent transverse surgical incisions into the
subcutaneous tissue. The one on the left is situated 11 cm. cephalad to the nipple
and the one on the right 8 cm. cephalad to the nipple. There is no hemorrhage or
ecchymosis associated with these wounds. A similar clean wound measuring 2 cm. in
length is situated on the antero-lateral aspect of the left mid arm. Situated on the
antero-lateral aspect of each ankle is a recent 2 cm. transverse incision into the
subcutaneous tissue.</p>

<p><span class="in40">There</span> is an old well healed 8 cm. McBurney
abdominal incision. Over the lumbar spine in the midline is an old, well healed
15 cm. scar. Situated on the upper antero-lateral aspect of the right thigh is an
old, well healed 8 cm. scar.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">MISSILE WOUNDS:</p>
<p class="up1"><span class="in40">1. There</span> is a large irregular defect of
the scalp and skull on the right involving
chiefly the parietal bone but extending somewhat into the temporal and occipital
regions. In this region there is an actual absence of scalp and bone producing a
defect which measures approximately 13 cm. in greatest diameter.</p>

<p><span class="in40">From</span> the irregular margins of the above
scalp defect tears extend in stellate fashion into the more or less intact scalp
as follows:</p>

<p>a. From the right inferior temporo-parietal margin anterior to the right ear to
a point slightly above the tragus.</p>

<p>b. From the anterior parietal margin anteriorly on the forehead to approximately
4 cm. above the right orbital ridge.</p>

<p>c. From the left margin of the main defect across the midline antero-laterally
for a distance of approximately 8 cm.</p>

<p>d. From the same starting point as c. 10 cm. postero-laterally.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>

Situated in the posterior scalp approximately 2.5 cm. laterally to the right and
slightly above the external occipital protuberance is a lacerated wound measuring
15 x 6 mm. In the underlying bone is a corresponding wound through the skull which
exhibits beveling of the margins of the bone when viewed from the inner aspect of
the skull.</p>

<p><span class="in40">Clearly</span> visible in the above described
large skull defect and exuding from it is lacerated brain tissue which on close
inspection proves to represent the major portion of the right cerebral hemisphere.
At this point it is noted that the falx cerebri is extensively lacerated with disruption
of the superior saggital sinus.</p>

<p><span class="in40">Upon</span> reflecting the scalp multiple complete
fracture lines are seen to radiate from both the large defect at the vertex and the
smaller wound at the occiput. These vary greatly in length and direction, the longest
measuring approximately 19 cm. These result in the production of numerous fragments
which vary in size from a few millimeters to 10 cm. in greatest diameter.</p>

<p><span class="in40">The</span> complexity of these fractures and the
fragments thus produced tax satisfactory verbal description and are better appreciated
in photographs and roentgenograms which are prepared.</p>

<p><span class="in40">The</span> brain is removed and preserved for
further study following formalin fixation.</p>

<p><span class="in40">Received</span> as separate specimens from Dallas,
Texas are three fragments of skull bone which in aggregate roughly approximate the
dimensions of the large defect described above. At one angle of the largest of these
fragments is a portion of the perimeter of a roughly circular wound presumably of
exit which exhibits beveling of the outer aspect of the bone and is estimated to
measure approximately 2.5 to 3.0 cm. in diameter. Roentgenograms of this fragment
reveal minute particles of metal in the bone at this margin. Roentgenograms of the
skull reveal multiple minute metallic fragments along a line corresponding with a line
joining the above described small occipital wound and the right supra-orbital ridge.
From the surface of the disrupted right cerebral cortex two small irregularly shaped
fragments of metal are recovered. These measure 7 x 2 mm. and 3 x 1 mm. These are
placed in the custody of Agents Francis X. O’Neill, Jr. and James W. Sibert, of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, who executed a receipt therefor (attached).</p>

<p><span class="in40">2. The</span> second wound presumably of entry
is that described above in the upper right posterior thorax. Beneath the skin there
is ecchymosis of subcutaneous tissue and musculature. The missile path through the
fascia and musculature cannot be easily probed. The wound presumably of exit was
that described by Dr. Malcolm Perry of Dallas in the low anterior cervical region.
When observed by Dr. Perry the wound measured “a few millimeters in diameter”, however
it was extended as a tracheostomy incision and thus its character is distorted
at the time of autopsy. However, there is considerable ecchymosis of the strap
muscles of the right side of the neck and of the fascia about the trachea adjacent
to the line of the tracheostomy wound. The third point of reference in connecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
these two wounds is in the apex (supra-clavicular portion) of the right pleural
cavity. In this region there is contusion of the parietal pleura and of the extreme
apical portion of the right upper lobe of the lung. In both instances the diameter
of contusion and ecchymosis at the point of maximal involvement measures 5 cm. Both
the visceral and parietal pleura are intact overlying these areas of trauma.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">INCISIONS:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">The</span> scalp wounds are extended in the coronal
plane to examine the cranial content and the
customary (Y) shaped incision is used to examine the body cavities.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">THORACIC CAVITY:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">The</span> bony cage is unremarkable. The thoracic
organs are in their normal positions and relationships
and there is no increase in free pleural fluid. The above described area
of contusion in the apical portion of the right pleural cavity is noted.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">LUNGS:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">The</span> lungs are of essentially similar appearance
the right weighing 320 Gm., the
left 290 Gm. The lungs are well aerated with smooth glistening pleural surfaces and
gray-pink color. A 5 cm. diameter area of purplish red discoloration and increased
firmness to palpation is situated in the apical portion of the right upper lobe.
This corresponds to the similar area described in the overlying parietal pleura.
Incision in this region reveals recent hemorrhage into pulmonary parenchyma.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">HEART:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">The</span> pericardial cavity is smooth walled
and contains approximately 10 cc. of straw-colored
fluid. The heart is of essentially normal external contour and weighs 350 Gm.
The pulmonary artery is opened in situ and no abnormalities are noted. The cardiac
chambers contain moderate amounts of postmortem clotted blood. There are no gross
abnormalities of the leaflets of any of the cardiac valves. The following are the
circumferences of the cardiac valves: aortic 7.5 cm., pulmonic 7 cm., tricuspid
12 cm., mitral 11 cm. The myocardium is firm and reddish brown. The left ventricular
myocardium averages 1.2 cm. in thickness, the right ventricular myocardium 0.4 cm.
The coronary arteries are dissected and are of normal distribution and smooth walled
and elastic throughout.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">ABDOMINAL CAVITY:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">The</span> abdominal organs are in their normal
positions and relationships and there is
no increase in free peritoneal fluid. The vermiform appendix is surgically absent
and there are a few adhesions joining the region of the cecum to the ventral abdominal
wall at the above described old abdominal incisional scar.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">SKELETAL SYSTEM:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">Aside</span> from the above described skull wounds
there are no significant gross skeletal
abnormalities.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">PHOTOGRAPHY:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">Black</span> and white and color photographs
depicting significant findings are exposed
but not developed. These photographs were placed in the custody of Agent Roy H.
Kellerman of the U. S. Secret Service, who executed a receipt therefore (attached).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span></p>

<p class="p1 in0">ROENTGENOGRAMS:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">Roentgenograms</span> are made of the entire body
and of the separately submitted three
fragments of skull bone. These are developed and were placed in the custody of
Agent Roy H. Kellerman of the U. S. Secret Service, who executed a receipt therefor
(attached).</p>

<p class="p1 in0">SUMMARY:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">Based</span> on the above observations it is our
opinion that the deceased died as a result
of two perforating gunshot wounds inflicted by high velocity projectiles fired by a
person or persons unknown. The projectiles were fired from a point behind and somewhat
above the level of the deceased. The observations and available information
do not permit a satisfactory estimate as to the sequence of the two wounds.</p>

<p><span class="in40">The</span> fatal missile entered the skull above
and to the right of the external occipital protuberance. A portion of the projectile
traversed the cranial cavity in a posterior-anterior direction (see lateral skull
roentgenograms) depositing minute particles along its path. A portion of the projectile
made its exit through the parietal bone on the right carrying with it
portions of cerebrum, skull and scalp. The two wounds of the skull combined with
the force of the missile produced extensive fragmentation of the skull, laceration of
the superior saggital sinus, and of the right cerebral hemisphere.</p>

<p><span class="in40">The</span> other missile entered the right superior
posterior thorax above the scapula and traversed the soft tissues of the supra-scapular
and the supra-clavicular portions of the base of the right side of the neck.
This missile produced contusions of the right apical parietal pleura and of the apical
portion of the right upper lobe of the lung. The missile contused the strap muscles
of the right side of the neck, damaged the trachea and made its exit through the
anterior surface of the neck. As far as can be ascertained this missile struck no
bony structures in its path through the body.</p>

<p><span class="in40">In</span> addition, it is our opinion that the
wound of the skull produced such extensive damage to the brain as to preclude the
possibility of the deceased surviving this injury.</p>

<p><span class="in40">A</span> supplementary report will be submitted
following more detailed examination of the brain and of microscopic sections. However,
it is not anticipated that these examinations will materially alter the findings.</p>

<p class="newpage p2 center">SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT OF AUTOPSY NUMBER A63-272<br />
PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY</p>

<p class="p2 in0">PATHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION REPORT <span class="in4">No. A63-272</span></p>

<p class="p1 in0">GROSS DESCRIPTION OF BRAIN:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">Following</span> formalin fixation the brain
weighs 1500 gms. The right cerebral
hemisphere is found to be markedly disrupted. There is a longitudinal laceration
of the right hemisphere which is para-sagittal in position approximately 2.5 cm.
to the right of the of the midline which extends from the tip of the occipital
lobe posteriorly to the tip of the frontal lobe anteriorly. The base of the
laceration is situated approximately 4.5 cm. below the vertex in the white matter.
There is considerable loss of cortical substance above the base of the laceration,
particularly in the parietal lobe. The margins of this laceration are at all
points jagged and irregular, with additional lacerations extending in varying
directions and for varying distances from the main laceration. In addition, there
is a laceration of the corpus callosum extending from the genu to the tail. Exposed
in this latter laceration are the interiors of the right lateral and third
ventricles.</p>

<p><span class="in40">When</span> viewed from the vertex the left
cerebral hemisphere is intact. There is marked engorgement of meningeal blood
vessels of the left temporal and frontal regions with considerable associated
sub-arachnoid hemorrhage. The gyri and sulci over the left hemisphere are of
essentially normal size and distribution. Those on the right are too fragmented
and distorted for satisfactory description.</p>

<p><span class="in40">When</span> viewed from the basilar aspect
the disruption of the right cortex is again obvious. There is a longitudinal
laceration of the mid-brain through the floor of the third ventricle just behind
the optic chiasm and the mammillary bodies. This laceration partially communicates
with an oblique 1.5 cm. tear through the left cerebral peduncle. There are
irregular superficial lacerations over the basilar aspects of the left temporal
and frontal lobes.</p>

<p><span class="in40">In</span> the interest of preserving the
specimen coronal sections are not made. The following sections are taken for
microscopic examination:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>a. From the margin of the laceration in the right parietal lobe.</p>

<p>b. From the margin of the laceration in the corpus callosum.</p>

<p>c. From the anterior portion of the laceration in the right frontal lobe.</p>

<p>d. From the contused left fronto-parietal cortex.</p>

<p>e. From the line of transection of the spinal cord.</p>

<p>f. From the right cerebellar cortex.</p>

<p>g. From the superficial laceration of the basilar aspect of the left temporal
lobe.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
<span class="in40">During</span> the course of this examination
seven (7) black and white and six (6) color 4x5 inch negatives are exposed but not
developed (the cassettes containing these negatives have been delivered by hand to
Rear Admiral George W. Burkley, MC, USN, White House Physician).</p>

<p class="p1 in0">MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:</p>

<p class="p0 in0">BRAIN:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">Multiple</span> sections from representative
areas as noted above are examined. All
sections are essentially similar and show extensive disruption of brain tissue with
associated hemorrhage. In none of the sections examined are there significant abnormalities
other than those directly related to the recent trauma.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">HEART:</p>
<p class="up1"><span class="in40">Sections</span> show a moderate amount of sub-epicardial
fat. The coronary arteries,
myocardial fibers, and endocardium are unremarkable.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">LUNGS:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">Sections</span> through the grossly described
area of contusion in the right upper
lobe exhibit disruption of alveolar walls and recent hemorrhage into alveoli.
Sections are otherwise essentially unremarkable.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">LIVER:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">Sections</span> show the normal hepatic architecture
to be well preserved. The
parenchymal cells exhibit markedly granular cytoplasm indicating high glycogen
content which is characteristic of the “liver biopsy pattern” of sudden death.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">SPLEEN:</p>
<p class="up1"><span class="in40">Sections</span> show no significant abnormalities.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">KIDNEYS:</p>

<p class="up1"><span class="in40">Sections</span> show no significant abnormalities
aside from dilatation and engorgement of
blood vessels of all calibers.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">SKIN WOUNDS:</p>
<p class="up1"><span class="in40">Sections</span> through the wounds in the
occipital and upper right posterior
thoracic regions are essentially similar. In each there is loss of continuity of
the epidermis with coagulation necrosis of the tissues at the wound margins. The
scalp wound exhibits several small fragments of bone at its margins in the subcutaneous
tissue.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">FINAL SUMMARY:</p>
<p class="up1"><span class="in40">This</span> supplementary report covers in more
detail the extensive degree of cerebral
trauma in this case. However neither this portion of the examination nor the microscopic
examinations alter the previously submitted report or add significant details
to the cause of death.</p>

<span class="subhead">Expert Testimony</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="hdr192">FIREARMS AND FIREARMS IDENTIFICATION</h3>

<p>Three experts gave testimony concerning firearms and firearms
identification: Robert A. Frazier and Cortlandt Cunningham of the
FBI, and Joseph D. Nicol, superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal
Identification and Investigation of the State of Illinois. Frazier has
been in the field of firearms identification for 23 years, following a
1-year course of specialized training in the FBI Laboratory. Cunningham
has been in the field for 5 years, having also completed the
FBI course. Nicol has been in the firearms identification field since
1941, having begun his training in the Chicago police crime laboratory.
Each has made many thousands of firearms identification examinations.<a id="FNanchor_A10-1" href="#Footnote_A10-1" class="fnanchor">A10-1</a>
Frazier testified on the rifle, the rifle cartridge cases, and the
rifle bullets; Cunningham on the revolver, the revolver cartridge cases,
the revolver bullets, and the paraffin test; and Nicol on all the bullets
and cartridge cases and the paraffin test.<a id="FNanchor_A10-2" href="#Footnote_A10-2" class="fnanchor">A10-2</a> Nicol’s conclusions were
identical to those of Frazier and Cunningham, except as noted.</p>

<h4 id="hdr193">General Principles</h4>

<p>A cartridge, or round of ammunition, is composed of a primer, a
cartridge case, powder, and a bullet. The primer, a metal cup containing
a detonable mixture, fits into the base of the cartridge case,
which is loaded with the powder. The bullet, which usually consists
of lead or of a lead core encased in a higher strength metal jacket, fits
into the neck of the cartridge case. To fire the bullet, the cartridge
is placed in the chamber of a firearm, immediately behind the firearm’s
barrel. The base of the cartridge rests against a solid support
called the breech face or, in the case of a bolt-operated weapon, the
bolt face. When the trigger is pulled, a firing pin strikes a swift,
hard blow into the primer, detonating the priming mixture. The
flames from the resulting explosion ignite the powder, causing a rapid
combustion whose force propels the bullet forward through the barrel.</p>

<p>The barrels of modern firearms are “rifled,” that is, several spiral
grooves are cut into the barrel from end to end. The purpose of the
rifling is to set the bullet spinning around its axis, giving it a stability
in flight that it would otherwise lack. The weapons of a given make
and model are alike in their rifling characteristics; that is, number of
grooves, number of lands (the raised portion of the barrel between the
grooves) and twist of the rifling. When a bullet is fired through a
barrel, it is engraved with these rifling characteristics. For example,
all S. &amp; W. .38/200 British Service Revolvers have five grooves and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
five lands, which twist to the right, and bullets fired through such a
revolver will have five groove and land impressions, right twist.</p>

<p>In addition to rifling characteristics, every weapon bears distinctive
microscopic characteristics on its components, including its barrel,
firing pin, and breech face. While a weapon’s rifling characteristics
are common to all other weapons of its make and model (and sometimes
even to weapons of a different make or model), a weapon’s microscopic
characteristics are distinctive, and differ from those of every other
weapon, regardless of make and model. Such markings are initially
caused during manufacture, since the action of manufacturing tools
differs microscopically from weapon to weapon, and since the tools
change microscopically while being operated. As a weapon is used,
further distinctive microscopic markings are introduced by the effects
of wear, fouling, and cleaning. As Frazier testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Q. Can you explain how you are able to come to a conclusion
that a cartridge case was fired in a particular weapon to the exclusion
of all other weapons?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; during the manufacture of a weapon,
there are certain things done to the mechanism of it, which are by
machine or by filing, by grinding, which form the parts of the
weapon into their final shape. These machining and grinding
and filing operations will mark the metal with very fine scratches
or turning marks and grinding marks in such a way that there
will be developed on the surface of the metal a characteristic
pattern. This pattern, because it is made by these accidental
machine-type operations, will be characteristic of that particular
weapon, and will not be reproduced on separate weapons. It
may be a combination of marks that—the face of the bolt may be
milled, then it may be in part filed to smooth off the corners, and
then, as a final operation, it may be polished, or otherwise adjusted
during the hand fitting operation, so that it does have its
particular pattern of microscopic marks.</p>

<p>The bolt face of the 139 rifle I have photographed and enlarged
in this photograph [Commission Exhibit No. 558] to show the
types of marks I was referring to.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The marks produced during manufacture are the marks seen on
the bolt face; filing marks, machining marks of the various types,
even forging marks or casting marks if the bolt happens to be
forged or cast. And then variations which occur in these marks
during the life of the weapon are very important in identification,
because many of the machining marks can be flattened out, can
be changed, by merely a grain of sand between the face of the
cartridge case and the bolt at the time a shot is fired, which will
itself scratch and dent the bolt face. So the bolt face will pick
up a characteristic pattern of marks which are peculiar to it.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
* * * [T]he marks which are placed on any bolt face are accidental
in nature. That is, they are not placed there intentionally
in the first place. They are residual to some machining operation,
such as a milling machine, in which each cutter of the milling
tool cuts away a portion of the metal; then the next tooth comes
along and cuts away a little more, and so on, until the final surface
bears the combination of the various teeth of the milling cutter.
In following that operation, then, the surface is additionally
scratched—until you have numerous—we call them microscopic
characteristics, a characteristic being a mark which is peculiar to
a certain place on the bolt face, and of a certain shape, it is of a
certain size, it has a certain contour, it may be just a little dimple
in the metal, or a spot of rust at one time on the face of the bolt,
or have occurred from some accidental means such as dropping
the bolt, or repeated use having flattened or smoothed off the
surface of the metal.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>* * * [A]s the blade of a milling machine travels around a surface,
it takes off actually a dust—it is not actually a piece of
metal—it scrapes a little steel off in the form of a dust—or a very
fine powder or chip—that tooth leaves a certain pattern of
marks—that edge. That milling cutter may have a dozen of these
edges on its surface, and each one takes a little more. Gradually
you wear the metal down, you tear it out actually until you are at
the proper depth. Those little pieces of metal, as they are traveling
around, can also scratch the face of the bolt—unless they are
washed away. So that you may have accidental marks from that
source, just in the machining operation.</p>

<p>Now, there are two types of marks produced in a cutting operation.
One, from the nicks along the cutting edge of the tool,
which are produced by a circular operating tool—which produce
very fine scratches in a circular pattern. Each time the
tool goes around, it erases those marks that were there before.
And when the tool is finally lifted out, you have a series of
marks which go around the surface which has been machined,
and you will find that that pattern of marks, as this tool goes
around, will change. In one area, it will be one set of marks—and
as you visually examine the surface of the metal, these very
fine marks will extend for a short distance, then disappear, and
a new mark of a new type will begin and extend for a short
distance. The entire surface, then, will have a—be composed
of a series of circles, but the individual marks seen in the microscope
will not be circular, will not form complete circles around the
face of the bolt.</p>

<p>Q. Have you had occasion to examine two consecutive bolt
faces from a factory?</p>

<p>A. Oh, yes.</p>

Q. And what did you find on that examination?</p>

<p>A. There would be no similarity in the individual microscopic
characteristics between the two bolt faces.</p>

<p>Q. There actually was none?</p>

<p>A. No, there was none.<a id="FNanchor_A10-3" href="#Footnote_A10-3" class="fnanchor">A10-3</a></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Q. How are you able to conclude that a given bullet was fired
in a given weapon to the exclusion of all other weapons, Mr.
Frazier?</p>

<p>A. That is based again upon the microscopic marks left on the
fired bullets and those marks in turn are based upon the barrel
from which the bullets are fired.</p>

<p>The marks in the barrel originate during manufacture. They
originate through use of the gun, through accidental marks resulting
from cleaning, excessive cleaning, of the weapon, or faulty
cleaning.</p>

<p>They result from corrosion in the barrel due to the hot gases
and possibly corrosive primer mixtures in the cartridges used, and
primarily again they result from wear, that is, an eroding of the
barrel through friction due to the firing of cartridges, bullets
through it.</p>

<p>In this particular barrel the manufacturer’s marks are caused
by the drill which drills out the barrel, leaving certain marks
from the drilling tool. Then portions of these marks are erased
by a rifling tool which cuts the four spiral grooves in the barrel
and, in turn, leaves marks themselves, and in connection with those
marks of course, the drilling marks, being circular in shape, there
is a tearing away of the surface of the metal, so that a microscopically
rough surface is left.</p>

<p>Then removing part of those marks with a separate tool causes
that barrel to assume an individual characteristic, a character
all of its own.</p>

<p>In other words, at that time you could identify a bullet fired
from that barrel as having been fired from the barrel to the
exclusion of all other barrels, because there is no system whatever
to the drilling of the barrel. The only system is in the rifling
or in the cutting of the grooves, and in this case of rifle barrels,
even the cutters wear down as the barrels are made, eventually
of course having to be discarded or resharpened.</p>

<p>Q. Have you examined consecutively manufactured barrels to
determine whether their microscopic characteristics are identical?</p>

<p>A. Yes, sir; I have three different sets of, you might say, paired
barrels, which have been manufactured on the same machine, one
after the other, under controlled conditions to make them as
nearly alike as possible, and in each case fired bullets from those
barrels could not be identified with each other; in fact, they looked
nothing at all alike as far as individual microscopic characteristics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>
are concerned. Their rifling impressions of course would be identical,
but the individual marks there would be entirely
different.<a id="FNanchor_A10-4" href="#Footnote_A10-4" class="fnanchor">A10-4</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When a cartridge is fired, the microscopic characteristics of the
weapon’s barrel are engraved into the bullet (along with its rifling
characteristics), and the microscopic characteristics of the firing pin
and breech face are engraved into the base of the cartridge case. By
virtue of these microscopic markings, an expert can frequently match
a bullet or cartridge case to the weapon in which it was fired. To
make such an identification, the expert compares the suspect bullet or
cartridge case under a comparison microscope, side by side with a test
bullet or cartridge case which has been fired in the weapon, to determine
whether the pattern of the markings in the test and suspect items
are sufficiently similar to show that they were fired in the same weapon.
This is exemplified by Frazier’s examination of Commission Exhibit
No. 543, one of the cartridge cases found in the Texas School Book
Depository Building after the assassination:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Q. Mr. Frazier, we were just beginning to discuss, before the
recess, Commission Exhibit 559, which is a picture, as you described
it, of Exhibit No. 543 and a test cartridge under a
microscope * * *?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Frazier.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Q. Could you discuss, by using that picture, some of the markings
which you have seen under the microscope and on the basis
of which you made your identification?</p>

<p>A. Yes, sir. In the photograph I have drawn some small circles
and numbered them, those circles, correspondingly on each side of
the photograph. The purpose of the circles is not to point out all
the similarities, but to call attention to some of them and to help
orient in locating a mark on one with a mark on the opposite side
of the photograph. In general the area shown is immediately
outside of the firing pin in the bolt of the 139 rifle, on the left
side of the photograph, and Commission Exhibit 543 on the
right side.</p>

<p>The circles have been drawn around the dents or irregularly
shaped ridges, small bumps, and depressions on the surface of the
metal in six places on each side of the photograph. It is an examination
of these marks, and all of the marks on the face of
the breech, microscopically which permits a conclusion to be
reached. The photograph itself actually is a substitute to show
only the type of marks found rather than their nature, that is,
their height, their width, or their relationship to each other, which
is actually a mental, visual, comparison on the two specimens
themselves.</p>

<p>Q. Referring for a second to this mental, visual, comparison,
Mr. Frazier, would a person without firearms training—firearms-identification
training—be able to look under a microscope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
and make a determination for himself concerning whether a
given cartridge case had been fired in a given weapon?</p>

<p>A. In that connection that person could look through the microscope.
He may or may not see these individual characteristics
which are present, because he does not know what to look for
in the first place, and, secondly, they are of such a nature that
you have to mentally sort them out in your mind going back and
forth between one area and the other until you form a mental
picture of them in a comparison such as this.</p>

<p>If it was a different type of comparison, of parallel marks or
something of that nature, then he could see the marks, but in
either instance, without having compared hundreds and hundreds
of specimens, he would not be able to make any statement as to
whether or not they were fired from the same rifle.</p>

<p>Q. Would you say that this is, then, a matter of expert interpretation
rather than a point-for-point comparison which a layman
could make?</p>

<p>A. I would say so; yes. I don’t think a layman would recognize
some of the things on these cartridge cases and some shown
in the photographs as actually being significant or not significant,
because there will be things present which have nothing whatsoever
to do with the firing of the cartridge case in the gun.</p>

<p>There may be a depression in the primer to begin with, and
there are no marks registered at that point as a result of the
firing. Unless these things are known to occur, someone may
actually arrive at a different conclusion, because of the absence
of similar marks.</p>

<p>Q. Now having reference to the specific exhibit before you,
which is 559—</p>

<p>A. Yes.</p>

<p>Q. Are all the marks shown in both photographs identical?</p>

<p>A. No.</p>

<p>Q. And could you go into detail on a mark which is not identical
to explain why you would get such a result?</p>

<p>A. Well, for instance, between what I have drawn here as
circle 4 and circle 5, there is a slanting line from the upper left
to the lower right on C-6. This line shows as a white line in the
photograph.</p>

<p>On the other side there is a rough, very rough ridge which runs
through there, having an entirely different appearance from the
relatively sharp line on C-6. The significant part of that mark
is the groove in between, rather than the sharp edge of the mark,
because the sharp corner could be affected by the hardness of
the metal or the irregular surface of the primer and the amount
of pressure exerted against it, pressing it back against the face
of the bolt, at the time the cartridges were fired. So that you
would never expect all the marks on one cartridge case to be
identical with all the marks on the other cartridge case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>
In fact, you would expect many differences. But the comparison
is made on the overall pattern, contour, and nature of
the marks that are present.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Q. Again there are dissimilar marks on these two pictures [of
the firing-pin depressions on the cartridge case Commission Exhibit
No. 543, and a test cartridge case], Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>A. Yes; there are, for the same reason, that metal does not
flow the same in every instance, and it will not be impressed to
the same depth and to the same amount, depending on the type
of metal, the blow that is struck, and the pressures involved.</p>

<p>Q. Is your identification made therefore on the basis of the
presence of similarities, as opposed to the absence of dissimilarities?</p>

<p>A. No, that is not exactly right. The identification is made
on the presence of sufficient individual microscopic characteristics
so that a very definite pattern is formed and visualized on the
two surfaces.</p>

<p>Dissimilarities may or may not be present, depending on
whether there have been changes to the firing pin through use or
wear, whether the metal flows are the same, and whether the pressures
are the same or not.</p>

<p>So I don’t think we can say that it is an absence of dissimilarities,
but rather the presence of similarities.<a id="FNanchor_A10-5" href="#Footnote_A10-5" class="fnanchor">A10-5</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A bullet or cartridge case cannot always be identified with the
weapon in which it was fired. In some cases, the bullet or cartridge
case is too mutilated. In other cases, the weapon’s microscopic characteristics
have changed between the time the suspect item was fired
and the time the test item was fired—microscopic characteristics
change drastically in a short period of time, due to wear, or over a
longer period of time, due to wear, corrosion, and cleaning. Still
again, the weapon may mark bullets inconsistently—for example,
because the bullets are smaller than the barrel, and travel through it
erratically.<a id="FNanchor_A10-6" href="#Footnote_A10-6" class="fnanchor">A10-6</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr194">The Rifle</h4>

<p>The rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository
shortly after the assassination was a bolt-action, clip-fed,
military rifle, 40.2 inches long and 8 pounds in weight.<a id="FNanchor_A10-7" href="#Footnote_A10-7" class="fnanchor">A10-7</a> Inscribed
on the rifle were various markings, including the words “CAL. 6.5,”
“MADE ITALY,” “TERNI,” and “ROCCA”; the numerals “1940”
and “40”; the serial number C2766; the letters “R-E,” “PG,” and
“TNI”; the figure of a crown; and several other barely decipherable
letters and numbers.<a id="FNanchor_A10-8" href="#Footnote_A10-8" class="fnanchor">A10-8</a> The rifle bore a very inexpensive Japanese
four-power sight, stamped “4 x 18 COATED,” “ORDNANCE
OPTICS INC.,” “HOLLYWOOD CALIFORNIA,” and “MADE
IN JAPAN”<a id="FNanchor_A10-9" href="#Footnote_A10-9" class="fnanchor">A10-9</a> and a sling consisting of two leather straps, one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span>
which had a broad patch, which apparently had been inserted on the
rifle and cut to length.<a id="FNanchor_A10-10" href="#Footnote_A10-10" class="fnanchor">A10-10</a> The sling was not a standard rifle sling,
but appeared to be a musical instrument strap or a sling from a
carrying case or camera bag.<a id="FNanchor_A10-11" href="#Footnote_A10-11" class="fnanchor">A10-11</a> A basic purpose of a rifle sling is to
enable the rifleman to steady his grip, by wrapping the arm into the
sling in a prescribed manner. The sling on the rifle was too short
to use in the normal way, but might have served to provide some additional
steadiness.<a id="FNanchor_A10-12" href="#Footnote_A10-12" class="fnanchor">A10-12</a></p>

<p>The rifle was identified as a 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano
Italian military rifle, Model 91/38.<a id="FNanchor_A10-13" href="#Footnote_A10-13" class="fnanchor">A10-13</a> This identification was initially
made by comparing the rifle with standard reference works and by
the markings inscribed on the rifle.<a id="FNanchor_A10-14" href="#Footnote_A10-14" class="fnanchor">A10-14</a> The caliber was independently
determined by chambering a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5 millimeter cartridge
in the rifle for fit, and by making a sulfur cast of the inside of
the rifle’s barrel which was measured with a micrometer.<a id="FNanchor_A10-15" href="#Footnote_A10-15" class="fnanchor">A10-15</a> (The
caliber of a weapon is the diameter of the interior of the barrel, measured
between opposite lands. The caliber of American weapons is
expressed in inches; thus a .30-caliber weapon has a barrel which is
thirty one-hundredths or three-tenths of an inch in diameter. The
caliber of continental European weapons is measured in millimeters.
A 6.5-millimeter caliber weapon corresponds to an American .257-caliber
weapon, that is, its barrel diameter is about one-fourth inch.)<a id="FNanchor_A10-16" href="#Footnote_A10-16" class="fnanchor">A10-16</a>
The identification was later confirmed by a communication from
SIFAR, the Italian Armed Forces Intelligence Service. This communication
also explained the markings on the rifle, as follows: “CAL.
6.5” refers to the rifle’s caliber; “MADE ITALY” refers to its origin,
and was inscribed at the request of the American importer prior to
shipment; “TERNI” means that the rifle was manufactured and
tested by the Terni Army Plant of Terni, Italy; the number “C2766” is
the serial number of the rifle, and the rifle in question is the only one
of its type bearing that serial number; the numerals “1940” and “40”
refer to the year of manufacture; and the other figures, numbers, and
letters are principally inspector’s, designer’s, or manufacturer’s
marks.<a id="FNanchor_A10-17" href="#Footnote_A10-17" class="fnanchor">A10-17</a></p>

<p>The Model 91/38 rifle was one of the 1891 series of Italian military
rifles, incorporating features designed by Ritter von Mannlicher and
M. Carcano. The series originally consisted of 6.5-millimeter caliber
rifles, but Model 38 of the series, designed shortly before World War
II, was a 7.35-millimeter caliber. Early in World War II, however,
the Italian Government, which encountered an ammunition supply
problem, began producing many of these rifles as 6.5-millimeter caliber
rifles, known as the 6.5-millimeter Model 91/38.<a id="FNanchor_A10-18" href="#Footnote_A10-18" class="fnanchor">A10-18</a> The 91/38 has been
imported into this country as surplus military equipment, has been
advertised quite widely, and is now fairly common in this country.<a id="FNanchor_A10-19" href="#Footnote_A10-19" class="fnanchor">A10-19</a></p>

<p>Like most bolt-action military rifles, the 91/38 is operated by turning
up the bolt handle, drawing the bolt to the rear, pushing the bolt
forward, turning down the bolt handle, and pulling the trigger.
Bringing the bolt forward and turning down the bolt handle compresses
the spring which drives the firing pin, and locks the bolt into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>
place. When the trigger is pulled, the cocked spring drives the firing
pin forward and the cartridge is fired. The face of the bolt bears a
lip, called the extractor, around a portion of its circumference. As
the bolt is pushed forward, this lip grasps the rim of the cartridge.
As the bolt is pulled back, the extractor brings the empty cartridge
case with it, and as the cartridge case is being brought back, it strikes
a projection in the ejection port called the ejector, which throws it out
of the rifle. Meanwhile, a leaf spring beneath the clip has raised the
next cartridge into loading position. When the bolt is brought forward,
it pushes the fresh cartridge into the chamber. The trigger
is pulled, the cartridge is fired, the bolt handle is brought up, the bolt
is brought back, and the entire cycle starts again. As long as there
is ammunition in the clip, one need only work the bolt and pull the
trigger to fire the rifle.<a id="FNanchor_A10-20" href="#Footnote_A10-20" class="fnanchor">A10-20</a></p>

<p>The clip itself is inserted into the rifle by drawing back the bolt,
and pushing the clip in from the top. The clip holds one to six cartridges.<a id="FNanchor_A10-21" href="#Footnote_A10-21" class="fnanchor">A10-21</a>
If six cartridges are inserted into the clip and an additional
cartridge is inserted into the chamber, up to seven bullets can
be fired before reloading.<a id="FNanchor_A10-22" href="#Footnote_A10-22" class="fnanchor">A10-22</a> When the rifle was found in the Texas
School Book Depository Building it contained a clip<a id="FNanchor_A10-23" href="#Footnote_A10-23" class="fnanchor">A10-23</a> which bore the
letters “SMI” (the manufacturer’s markings) and the number “952”
(possibly a part number or the manufacturer’s code number).<a id="FNanchor_A10-24" href="#Footnote_A10-24" class="fnanchor">A10-24</a> The
rifle probably was sold without a clip; however, the clip is commonly
available.<a id="FNanchor_A10-25" href="#Footnote_A10-25" class="fnanchor">A10-25</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr195">Rifle Cartridge and Cartridge Cases</h4>

<p>When the rifle was found, one cartridge was in the chamber.<a id="FNanchor_A10-26" href="#Footnote_A10-26" class="fnanchor">A10-26</a> The
cartridge was a 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano cartridge, manufactured
by the Western Cartridge Co., at East Alton, Ill. This type
of cartridge is loaded with a full metal-jacketed, military type of
bullet, weighing 160-161 grains. The bullet has parallel sides and a
round nose. It is just under 1.2 inches long, and just over one-fourth
inch in diameter.<a id="FNanchor_A10-27" href="#Footnote_A10-27" class="fnanchor">A10-27</a> Its velocity is approximately 2,165 feet per second.<a id="FNanchor_A10-28" href="#Footnote_A10-28" class="fnanchor">A10-28</a>
The cartridge is very dependable; in tests runs by the FBI and
the Infantry Weapons Evaluation Branch of the U.S. Army, the
C2766 rifle was fired with this Western Cartridge Co. ammunition over
100 times, with no misfires. (In contrast, some of the other ammunition
available on the market for this rifle is undesirable or of very
poor quality).<a id="FNanchor_A10-29" href="#Footnote_A10-29" class="fnanchor">A10-29</a> The cartridge is readily available for purchase from
mail-order houses, as well as a few gunshops; some 2 million rounds
have been placed on sale in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A10-30" href="#Footnote_A10-30" class="fnanchor">A10-30</a></p>

<p>The presence of the cartridge in the chamber did not necessarily
mean that the assassin considered firing another bullet, since he may
have reloaded merely by reflex.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span><a id="FNanchor_A10-31" href="#Footnote_A10-31" class="fnanchor">A10-31</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span>
Apart from the cartridge in the rifle, three expended cartridge
cases were found in the southeast portion of the sixth floor of the
Texas School Book Depository Building, lying between the south
wall and a high stack of boxes which ran parallel to the wall.<a id="FNanchor_A10-32" href="#Footnote_A10-32" class="fnanchor">A10-32</a>
The cartridge cases were a short distance to the west of the
southeast corner window in that wall.<a id="FNanchor_A10-33" href="#Footnote_A10-33" class="fnanchor">A10-33</a> Based on a comparison with
test cartridge cases fired from the C2766 rifle, the three cartridge
cases were identified as having been fired from the C2766 rifle.<a id="FNanchor_A10-34" href="#Footnote_A10-34" class="fnanchor">A10-34</a> (See
Commission Exhibit No. 558, <a href="#Page_556">p. 556</a>.) A test was run to determine
if the cartridge-case-ejection pattern of the rifle was consistent
with the assumption that the assassin had fired from the southeast
window.<a id="FNanchor_A10-35" href="#Footnote_A10-35" class="fnanchor">A10-35</a> In this test, 11 cartridges were fired from the rifle while
it was depressed 45° downward, and 8 cartridges were fired from
the rifle while it was held horizontally. The elevation of the ejected
cartridge cases above the level of the ejection port, and the points
on the floor at which the ejection cartridge cases initially landed,
were then plotted. The results of these tests are illustrated by the
diagrams, Commission Exhibits Nos. 546 and 547. Briefly, Commission
Exhibit No. 547 shows that with the weapon depressed at a
45° angle, the cartridge cases did not rise more than 2 inches above
the ejection port; with the weapon held horizontally, they did not
rise more than 12 inches above the ejection port.<a id="FNanchor_A10-36" href="#Footnote_A10-36" class="fnanchor">A10-36</a> Commission Exhibit
No. 546 shows that if a circle was drawn around the initial
landing points of the cartridge cases which were ejected in the
test while the rifle was held depressed at 45°, the center of the circle
would be located 86 inches and 80° to the right of the rifle’s line of
sight; if a circle was drawn around the initial landing points of the
cartridge cases ejected while the rifle was held horizontally, the
center of the circle would be 80 inches and 90° to the right of the line
of sight. In other words, the cartridge cases were ejected to the right
of and at roughly a right angle to the rifle.<a id="FNanchor_A10-37" href="#Footnote_A10-37" class="fnanchor">A10-37</a> The cartridge cases
showed considerable ricochet after their initial landing, bouncing from
8 inches to 15 feet.<a id="FNanchor_A10-38" href="#Footnote_A10-38" class="fnanchor">A10-38</a> The location of the cartridge cases was therefore
consistent with the southeast window having been used by the
assassin, since if the assassin fired from that window the ejected
cartridge cases would have hit the pile of boxes at his back and
ricocheted between the boxes and the wall until they came to rest
to the west of the window.<a id="FNanchor_A10-39" href="#Footnote_A10-39" class="fnanchor">A10-39</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr196">The Rifle Bullets</h4>

<p>In addition to the three cartridge cases found in the Texas School
Book Depository Building, a nearly whole bullet was found on Governor
Connally’s stretcher and two bullet fragments were found in the
front of the President’s car.<a id="FNanchor_A10-40" href="#Footnote_A10-40" class="fnanchor">A10-40</a> The stretcher bullet weighed 158.6
grains, or several grains less than the average Western Cartridge Co.
6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano bullet.<a id="FNanchor_A10-41" href="#Footnote_A10-41" class="fnanchor">A10-41</a> It was slightly flattened,
but otherwise unmutilated.<a id="FNanchor_A10-42" href="#Footnote_A10-42" class="fnanchor">A10-42</a> The two bullet fragments weighed 44.6
and 21.0 grains, respectively<a id="FNanchor_A10-43" href="#Footnote_A10-43" class="fnanchor">A10-43</a> The heavier fragment was a portion
of a bullet’s nose area, as shown by its rounded contour and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span>
character of the markings it bore.<a id="FNanchor_A10-44" href="#Footnote_A10-44" class="fnanchor">A10-44</a> The lighter fragment consisted
of bullet’s base portion, as shown by its shape and by the presence of
a cannelure.<a id="FNanchor_A10-45" href="#Footnote_A10-45" class="fnanchor">A10-45</a> The two fragments were both mutilated, and it was
not possible to determine from the fragments themselves whether
they comprised the base and nose of one bullet or of two separate
bullets.<a id="FNanchor_A10-46" href="#Footnote_A10-46" class="fnanchor">A10-46</a> However, each had sufficient unmutilated area to provide
the basis of an identification.<a id="FNanchor_A10-47" href="#Footnote_A10-47" class="fnanchor">A10-47</a> Based on a comparison with test
bullets fired from the C2766 rifle, the stretcher bullet and both bullet
fragments were identified as having been fired from the C2766 rifle.<a id="FNanchor_A10-48" href="#Footnote_A10-48" class="fnanchor">A10-48</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr197">The Revolver</h4>

<p>The revolver taken from Oswald at the time of his arrest was a
.38 Special S. &amp; W. Victory Model revolver.<a id="FNanchor_A10-49" href="#Footnote_A10-49" class="fnanchor">A10-49</a> It bore the serial
No. V510210, and is the only such revolver with that serial number,
since S. &amp; W. does not repeat serial numbers.<a id="FNanchor_A10-50" href="#Footnote_A10-50" class="fnanchor">A10-50</a> The revolver was originally
made in the United States, but was shipped to England, as
shown by the English inspection or proof marks on the chambers.<a id="FNanchor_A10-51" href="#Footnote_A10-51" class="fnanchor">A10-51</a>
The revolver showed definite signs of use but was in good operating
condition.<a id="FNanchor_A10-52" href="#Footnote_A10-52" class="fnanchor">A10-52</a> The revolver was originally designed to fire a .38 S. &amp; W.
cartridge, whose bullet is approximately 12 or 13 grains lighter than
the .38 Special, and approximately .12 inches shorter, but has a somewhat
larger diameter.<a id="FNanchor_A10-53" href="#Footnote_A10-53" class="fnanchor">A10-53</a> In the United States, the .38 Special is considered
to be a better bullet than the .38 S. &amp; W.,<a id="FNanchor_A10-54" href="#Footnote_A10-54" class="fnanchor">A10-54</a> and the revolver
was rechambered for a .38 Special prior to being sold in the United
States.<a id="FNanchor_A10-55" href="#Footnote_A10-55" class="fnanchor">A10-55</a> The weapon was not rebarreled, although the barrel was
shortened by cutting off approximately 2¾ of its original 5 inches.<a id="FNanchor_A10-56" href="#Footnote_A10-56" class="fnanchor">A10-56</a>
The shortening of the barrel had no functional value, except to facilitate
concealment.<a id="FNanchor_A10-57" href="#Footnote_A10-57" class="fnanchor">A10-57</a></p>

<p>The weapon is a conventional revolver, with a rotating cylinder
holding one to six cartridges. It is loaded by swinging out the cylinder
and inserting cartridges into the cylinder’s chambers. If all six chambers
are loaded, the weapon can be fired six consecutive times without
reloading.<a id="FNanchor_A10-58" href="#Footnote_A10-58" class="fnanchor">A10-58</a> To extract empty cartridge cases, the cylinder is swung
out and an ejector rod attached to the cylinder is pushed, simultaneously
ejecting all the cartridge cases (and cartridges) in the
cylinder. If both live cartridges and expended cartridge cases are
in the cylinder, before pushing the ejection rod one can tip the cylinder
and dump the live cartridges into his hand.<a id="FNanchor_A10-59" href="#Footnote_A10-59" class="fnanchor">A10-59</a> The cartridge cases will
not fall out, because they are lighter than the cartridges, and when
fired they will have expanded so as to tightly fit the chamber walls.<a id="FNanchor_A10-60" href="#Footnote_A10-60" class="fnanchor">A10-60</a></p>

<p>In a crouched stance a person can fire five shots with the revolver
in 3-4 seconds with no trouble, and would need no training to hit a
human body four times in four or five shots at a range of 8 feet.<a id="FNanchor_A10-61" href="#Footnote_A10-61" class="fnanchor">A10-61</a> A
person who had any training with the weapon would not find its
recoil noticeable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span><a id="FNanchor_A10-62" href="#Footnote_A10-62" class="fnanchor">A10-62</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr198">Revolver Cartridges and Cartridge Cases</h4>

<p>When Oswald was arrested six live cartridges were found in the
revolver.<a id="FNanchor_A10-63" href="#Footnote_A10-63" class="fnanchor">A10-63</a> Three were Western .38 Specials, loaded with copper-coated
lead bullets, and three were Remington-Peters .38 Specials,
loaded with lead bullets.<a id="FNanchor_A10-64" href="#Footnote_A10-64" class="fnanchor">A10-64</a> Five additional live cartridges were found
in Oswald’s pocket,<a id="FNanchor_A10-65" href="#Footnote_A10-65" class="fnanchor">A10-65</a> all of which were Western .38 Specials, loaded
with copper-coated bullets.<a id="FNanchor_A10-66" href="#Footnote_A10-66" class="fnanchor">A10-66</a> The Western and Remington-Peters .38
Special cartridges are virtually identical—the copper coating on the
Western bullets is not a full jacket, but only a gilding metal, put on
principally for sales appeal.<a id="FNanchor_A10-67" href="#Footnote_A10-67" class="fnanchor">A10-67</a></p>

<p>Four expended cartridge cases were found near the site of the Tippit
killing.<a id="FNanchor_A10-68" href="#Footnote_A10-68" class="fnanchor">A10-68</a> Two of these cartridge cases were Remington-Peters .38
Specials and two were Western .38 Specials.<a id="FNanchor_A10-69" href="#Footnote_A10-69" class="fnanchor">A10-69</a> Based on a comparison
with test cartridge cases fired in the V510210 revolver, the four
cartridge cases were identified as having been fired in the V510210
revolver.<a id="FNanchor_A10-70" href="#Footnote_A10-70" class="fnanchor">A10-70</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr199">Revolver Bullets</h4>

<p>Four bullets were recovered from the body of Officer Tippit.<a id="FNanchor_A10-71" href="#Footnote_A10-71" class="fnanchor">A10-71</a> In
Nicol’s opinion one of the four bullets could be positively identified
with test bullets fired from V510210 revolver, and the other three
could have been fired from that revolver.<a id="FNanchor_A10-72" href="#Footnote_A10-72" class="fnanchor">A10-72</a> In Cunningham’s opinion
all four bullets could have been fired from the V510210 revolver, but
none could be positively identified to the revolver<a id="FNanchor_A10-73" href="#Footnote_A10-73" class="fnanchor">A10-73</a>—that is, in his
opinion the bullets bore the revolver’s rifling characteristics, but no
conclusion could be drawn on the basis of microscopic characteristics.<a id="FNanchor_A10-74" href="#Footnote_A10-74" class="fnanchor">A10-74</a>
Cunningham did not conclude that the bullets had not been
fired from the revolver, since he found that consecutive bullets fired
in the revolver by the FBI could not even be identified with each other
under the microscope.<a id="FNanchor_A10-75" href="#Footnote_A10-75" class="fnanchor">A10-75</a> The apparent reasons for this was that while
the revolver had been rechambered for a .38 Special cartridge, it had
not been rebarreled for a .38 Special bullet. The barrel was therefore
slightly oversized for a .38 Special bullet, which has a smaller diameter
than a .38 S. &amp; W. bullet. This would cause the passage of a .38
Special bullet through the barrel to be erratic, resulting in inconsistent
microscopic markings.<a id="FNanchor_A10-76" href="#Footnote_A10-76" class="fnanchor">A10-76</a></p>

<p>Based on the number of grooves, groove widths, groove spacing, and
knurling on the four recovered bullets, three were copper-coated lead
bullets of Western-Winchester manufacture (Western and Winchester
are divisions of the same company), and the fourth was a lead bullet
of Remington-Peters manufacture.<a id="FNanchor_A10-77" href="#Footnote_A10-77" class="fnanchor">A10-77</a> This contrasts with the four recovered
cartridge cases, which consisted of two Remington-Peters
and two Westerns. There are several possible explanations for this
variance: (1) the killer fired five cartridges, three of which were
Western-Winchester and two of which were Remington-Peters; one
Remington-Peters bullet missed Tippit; and a Western-Winchester
cartridge case and the Remington-Peters bullet that missed were
simply not found. (2) The killer fired only four cartridges, three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span>
of which were Western-Winchester and one of which was Remington-Peters;
prior to the shooting the killer had an expended Remington-Peters
cartridge case in his revolver, which was ejected with the three
Western-Winchester and one Remington-Peters cases; and one of the
Western-Winchester cases was not found. (3) The killer was using
hand-loaded ammunition, that is, ammunition which is made with
used cartridge cases to save money; thus he might have loaded one
make of bullet into another make of cartridge case.<a id="FNanchor_A10-78" href="#Footnote_A10-78" class="fnanchor">A10-78</a> This third possibility
is extremely unlikely, because when a cartridge is fired the
cartridge case expands, and before it can be reused it must be resized.
There was, however, no evidence that any of the four recovered cartridge
cases had been resized.<a id="FNanchor_A10-79" href="#Footnote_A10-79" class="fnanchor">A10-79</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr200">The Struggle for the Revolver</h4>

<p>Officer McDonald of the Dallas police, who arrested Oswald, stated
that he had struggled with Oswald for possession of the revolver
and that in the course of the struggle, “I heard the snap of the hammer,
and the pistol crossed my left cheek * * * the primer of one round
was dented on misfire at the time of the struggle. * * *”<a id="FNanchor_A10-80" href="#Footnote_A10-80" class="fnanchor">A10-80</a> However,
none of the cartridges found in the revolver bore the impression of
the revolver’s firing pin.<a id="FNanchor_A10-81" href="#Footnote_A10-81" class="fnanchor">A10-81</a> In addition, the revolver is so constructed
that the firing pin cannot strike a cartridge unless the hammer (which
bears the firing pin) has first been drawn all the way back by a complete
trigger pull.<a id="FNanchor_A10-82" href="#Footnote_A10-82" class="fnanchor">A10-82</a> Had the hammer gone all the way back and then
hit the cartridge, it is unlikely that the cartridge would have misfired.<a id="FNanchor_A10-83" href="#Footnote_A10-83" class="fnanchor">A10-83</a>
It would be possible for a person to interject his finger between
the hammer and the cartridge, but the spring driving the hammer
is a very strong one and the impact of the firing pin into a finger
would be clearly felt.<a id="FNanchor_A10-84" href="#Footnote_A10-84" class="fnanchor">A10-84</a> However, the cylinder and the trigger are
interconnected and the trigger cannot be fully pulled back if the
cylinder is grasped.<a id="FNanchor_A10-85" href="#Footnote_A10-85" class="fnanchor">A10-85</a> Therefore, if Oswald had pulled on the trigger
while McDonald was firmly grasping the cylinder, the revolver would
not have fired, and if the gun was grabbed away at the same time the
trigger would have snapped back with an audible sound.<a id="FNanchor_A10-86" href="#Footnote_A10-86" class="fnanchor">A10-86</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr201">The Paraffin Test</h4>

<p>During the course of the interrogation of Lee Harvey Oswald following
the assassination a paraffin test was performed by the Dallas
police on both of his hands and his right cheek. The paraffin cast of
Oswald’s hands reacted positively to the test. The cast of the right
cheek showed no reaction.<a id="FNanchor_A10-87" href="#Footnote_A10-87" class="fnanchor">A10-87</a></p>

<p>To perform the paraffin test, layers of warm liquid paraffin, interleaved
with layers of gauze for reinforcement, are brushed or
poured on the suspect’s skin. The warm sticky paraffin opens the
skin’s pores and picks up any dirt and foreign material present at
the surface. When the paraffin cools and hardens it forms a cast,
which is taken off and processed with diphenylamine or diphenylbenzidine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span>
chemicals which turn blue in the presence of nitrates.
Since gunpowder residues contain nitrates, the theory behind the test
is that if a cast reacts positively, i.e., if blue dots appear, it provides
evidence that the suspect recently fired a weapon.<a id="FNanchor_A10-88" href="#Footnote_A10-88" class="fnanchor">A10-88</a> In fact, however,
the test is completely unreliable in determining either whether a person
has recently fired a weapon or whether he has not.<a id="FNanchor_A10-89" href="#Footnote_A10-89" class="fnanchor">A10-89</a> On the
one hand, diphenylamine and diphenylbenzidine will react positively
not only with nitrates from gunpowder residues, but nitrates from
other sources and most oxidizing agents, including dichromates, permanganates,
hypochlorates, periodates, and some oxides. Thus, contact
with tobacco, Clorox, urine, cosmetics, kitchen matches, pharmaceuticals,
fertilizers, or soils, among other things, may result in a
positive reaction to the paraffin test. Also, the mere handling of a
weapon may leave nitrates on the skin.<a id="FNanchor_A10-90" href="#Footnote_A10-90" class="fnanchor">A10-90</a> A positive reaction is, therefore,
valueless in determining whether a suspect has recently fired a
weapon. Conversely, a person who has recently fired a weapon may
not show a positive reaction to the paraffin test, particularly if the
weapon was a rifle. A revolver is so constructed that there is a space
between the cylinder, which bears the chambers, and the barrel. When
a revolver is fired, nitrate-bearing gases escape through this space
and may leave residues on the hand.<a id="FNanchor_A10-91" href="#Footnote_A10-91" class="fnanchor">A10-91</a> In a rifle, however, there is
no gap between the chamber and the barrel, and one would therefore
not expect nitrates to be deposited upon a person’s hands or cheeks
as a result of his firing a rifle. As Cunningham testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cunningham</span>. * * * I personally wouldn’t expect to find
any residues on a person’s right cheek after firing a rifle due to the
fact that by the very principles and the manufacture and the action,
the cartridge itself is sealed into the chamber by the bolt
being closed behind it, and upon firing the case, the cartridge case
expands into the chamber filling it up and sealing it off from the
gases, so none will come back in your face, and so by its very nature,
I would not expect to find residue on the right cheek of a
shooter.<a id="FNanchor_A10-92" href="#Footnote_A10-92" class="fnanchor">A10-92</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The unreliability of the paraffin test has been demonstrated by experiments
run by the FBI. In one experiment, conducted prior to the
assassination, paraffin tests were performed on 17 men who had just
fired 5 shots with a .38-caliber revolver. Eight men tested negative in
both hands, three men tested positive on the idle hand and negative on
the firing hand, two men tested positive on the firing hand and negative
on the idle hand, and four men tested positive on both their firing
and idle hands.<a id="FNanchor_A10-93" href="#Footnote_A10-93" class="fnanchor">A10-93</a> In a second experiment, paraffin tests were performed
on 29 persons, 9 of whom had just fired a revolver or an automatic,
and 20 of whom had not fired a weapon. All 29 persons tested
positive on either or both hands.<a id="FNanchor_A10-94" href="#Footnote_A10-94" class="fnanchor">A10-94</a> In a third experiment, performed
after the assassination, an agent of the FBI, using the C2766 rifle, fired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
three rounds of Western 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano ammunition
in rapid succession. A paraffin test was then performed on both
of his hands and his right cheek. Both of his hands and his cheek
tested negative.<a id="FNanchor_A10-95" href="#Footnote_A10-95" class="fnanchor">A10-95</a></p>

<p>The paraffin casts of Oswald’s hands and right cheek were also examined
by neutron-activation analyses at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. Barium and antimony were found to be present on both
surfaces of all the casts and also in residues from the rifle cartridge
cases and the revolver cartridge cases.<a id="FNanchor_A10-96" href="#Footnote_A10-96" class="fnanchor">A10-96</a> Since barium and antimony
were present in both the rifle and the revolver cartridge cases, their
presence on the casts were not evidence that Oswald had fired the
rifle. Moreover, the presence on the inside surface of the cheek cast
of a lesser amount of barium, and only a slightly greater amount of
antimony, than was found on the outside surface of the cast rendered
it impossible to attach significance to the presence of these elements
on the inside surface. Since the outside surface had not been in contact
with Oswald’s cheek, the barium and antimony found there had
come from a source other than Oswald. Furthermore, while there
was more barium and antimony present on the casts than would normally
be found on the hands of a person who had not fired a weapon
or handled a fired weapon, it is also true that barium and antimony
may be present in many common items; for example, barium may
be present in grease, ceramics, glass, paint, printing ink, paper,
rubber, plastics, leather, cloth, pyrotechnics, oilcloth and linoleum,
storage batteries, matches and cosmetics; antimony is present in
matches, type metal, lead alloys, paints and lacquers, pigments
for oil and water colors, flameproof textiles, storage batteries,
pyrotechnics, rubber, pharmaceutical preparations and calico; and
both barium and antimony are present in printed paper and cloth,
paint, storage batteries, rubber, matches, pyrotechnics, and possibly
other items. However, the barium and antimony present in these
items are usually not present in a form which would lead to their adhering
to the skin of a person who had handled such items.<a id="FNanchor_A10-97" href="#Footnote_A10-97" class="fnanchor">A10-97</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr202">The Walker Bullet</h4>

<p>On April 10, 1963, a bullet was recovered from General Walker’s
home, following an attempt on his life.<a id="FNanchor_A10-98" href="#Footnote_A10-98" class="fnanchor">A10-98</a> The bullet, which was
severely mutilated, weighed 148.25 grains.<a id="FNanchor_A10-99" href="#Footnote_A10-99" class="fnanchor">A10-99</a> This bullet had the
rifling characteristics of the C2766 rifle and all its remaining physical
characteristics were the same as the Western 6.5 millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano
bullet. However, while the bullet could have been
fired from the C2766 rifle, it was severely mutilated and in Frazier’s
opinion could not be identified as having been fired or not fired from
that rifle.<a id="FNanchor_A10-100" href="#Footnote_A10-100" class="fnanchor">A10-100</a> Nicol agreed that a positive identification could not be
made, but concluded there was “a fair probability” that the bullet had
been fired from the same rifle as the test bullets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span><a id="FNanchor_A10-101" href="#Footnote_A10-101" class="fnanchor">A10-101</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr203">FINGERPRINTS AND PALMPRINTS</h3>

<p>Two experts gave testimony concerning fingerprints and palmprints:
Sebestian Latona<a id="FNanchor_A10-102" href="#Footnote_A10-102" class="fnanchor">A10-102</a> and Arthur Mandella.<a id="FNanchor_A10-103" href="#Footnote_A10-103" class="fnanchor">A10-103</a> Latona is the supervisor
of the Latent Fingerprint Section of the Identification Division
of the FBI. He has been with that Division over 32 years, having
begun as a student fingerprint classifier and worked up to his present
position. Mandella is a detective and fingerprint instructor with the
police department of the city of New York. He has been in the fingerprint
field for 19 years. Both have made a vast number of fingerprint
examinations and have testified in Federal, State, and military
courts.<a id="FNanchor_A10-104" href="#Footnote_A10-104" class="fnanchor">A10-104</a> Their conclusions were identical, except as noted.</p>

<h4 id="hdr204">General Principles<a id="FNanchor_A10-105" href="#Footnote_A10-105" class="fnanchor">A10-105</a></h4>

<p>Fingerprints and palmprints are made by the ridges which cover
the surface of the fingers and palms. These ridges first appear 2 or 3
months before birth, and remain unchanged until death. Commission
Exhibit No. 634-A (<a href="#Page_564">p. 564</a>) illustrates several common characteristics
or “points” formed by the ridges; a clear fingerprint impression will
contain anywhere from 85 to 125 such points. While many of the
common points appear in almost every print, no two prints have the
same points in the same relationship to each other.</p>

<p>A print taken by a law-enforcement agency is known as an “inked
print,” and is carefully taken so that all the characteristics of the
print are reproduced on the fingerprint card; a print which is left
accidentally, such as a print left at the scene of a crime, is known as
a latent print. To make an identification of a latent print, the expert
compares the points in the latent print with the points in an inked
print. If a point appearing in a latent print does not appear in the
inked print, or vice versa, the expert concludes that the two prints were
not made by the same finger or palm. An identification is made only
if there are no inconsistencies between the inked and latent prints, and
the points of similarity and their relative positions are sufficiently
distinctive, and sufficient in number, to satisfy the expert that an
identity exists.<a id="FNanchor_A10-106" href="#Footnote_A10-106" class="fnanchor">A10-106</a></p>

<p>There is some disagreement concerning whether a minimum number
of points is necessary for an identification. Some foreign law-enforcement
agencies require a minimum number of 16 points. However, in
the United States, in which there has been a great deal of experience
with fingerprints, expert opinion holds there is no minimum number
of points, and that each print must be evaluated on its own merits.<a id="FNanchor_A10-107" href="#Footnote_A10-107" class="fnanchor">A10-107</a></p>

<p>Palmprints are as distinctive as fingerprints, but are not as popularly
known. Possibly this is because law enforcement agencies
usually record only fingerprints for their identification files, since
fingerprints can be much more readily classified and filed than palmprints.
Also, latent fingerprint impressions are probably more common
than latent palmprint impressions, because persons generally
touch objects with their fingers rather than their palms. However,
palmprints will frequently be found on heavy objects, since the palms
as well as the fingers are employed in handling such objects.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span><a id="FNanchor_A10-108" href="#Footnote_A10-108" class="fnanchor">A10-108</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span>
A latent print is the result of perspiration exuded by the sweat
pores in the ridges. This perspiration is composed of water, protein
or fatty materials, and sodium chloride (salt). A latent print can
be developed—made visible—in several ways. Sometimes a latent
print can be developed merely by the use of correct lighting. A
second method is to brush the print very lightly with a powder, which
adheres to its outline. Once a print is powdered it can be photographed,
lifted, or both. (In lifting, an adhesive substance, such
as scotch tape, is placed over a powdered print. When the adhesive
is lifted the powder clings to its surface. The adhesive is then
mounted.) However, powder is usually effective only on objects
which have a hard, smooth, nonabsorbent surface, such as glass, tile,
and various types of highly polished metals and is usually not effective
on absorbent materials, such as paper or unfinished wood or metal,
which absorb perspiration so that there is nothing on the material’s
surface to which the powder can adhere. Prints on absorbent materials
can sometimes be developed by iodine fumes, which may react
with fatty or protein materials which have been absorbed into the
object, or by a silver nitrate solution, which may react with sodium
chloride which has been absorbed into the object.<a id="FNanchor_A10-109" href="#Footnote_A10-109" class="fnanchor">A10-109</a></p>

<p>Not every contact of a finger or palm leaves a latent print. For
example, if the surface is not susceptible to a latent print, if the
finger or palm had no perspiration, or if the perspiration was mostly
water and had evaporated, no print will be found.<a id="FNanchor_A10-110" href="#Footnote_A10-110" class="fnanchor">A10-110</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr205">Objects in the Texas School Book Depository Building</h4>

<p>A number of objects found in the Texas School Book Depository
Building following the assassination were processed for latent
fingerprints by the FBI—in some cases, after they had been processed
by the Dallas police. These objects included the homemade
wrapping paper bag found near the southeast corner window; the,
C2766 rifle; three small cartons which were stacked near that window
(which were marked “Box A,” “Box B,” and “Box C”),<a id="FNanchor_A10-111" href="#Footnote_A10-111" class="fnanchor">A10-111</a> and a
fourth carton resting on the floor nearby (marked “Box D”);<a id="FNanchor_A10-112" href="#Footnote_A10-112" class="fnanchor">A10-112</a> the
three 6.5-millimeter cartridge cases found near the window; and the
cartridge found in the rifle. The results were as follows:</p>

<p><i>The paper bag.</i>—The FBI developed a palmprint and a fingerprint
on the paper bag by silver nitrate. These were compared with the
fingerprints and palmprints of Lee Harvey Oswald taken by the
Dallas police, and were found to have been made by the right palm
and the left index finger of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A10-113" href="#Footnote_A10-113" class="fnanchor">A10-113</a></p>

<p><i>The C2766 rifle.</i>—The wood and metal of the rifle was absorbent,
and not conducive to recording a good print.<a id="FNanchor_A10-114" href="#Footnote_A10-114" class="fnanchor">A10-114</a> However, the Dallas
police developed by powder some faint ridge formations on the
metal magazine housing in front of the trigger and also developed
by powder and lifted a latent palmprint from the underside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span>
of the barrel.<a id="FNanchor_A10-115" href="#Footnote_A10-115" class="fnanchor">A10-115</a> The faint ridge formations were insufficient for
purposes of effecting an identification,<a id="FNanchor_A10-116" href="#Footnote_A10-116" class="fnanchor">A10-116</a> but the latent palmprint
was identified as the right palm of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A10-117" href="#Footnote_A10-117" class="fnanchor">A10-117</a></p>

<p><i>The cartons.</i>—Using the silver nitrate method, the FBI developed
nine identifiable latent fingerprints and four identifiable latent palmprints
on Box A,<a id="FNanchor_A10-118" href="#Footnote_A10-118" class="fnanchor">A10-118</a> seven identifiable fingerprints and two identifiable

Studebaker. All but one of the fingerprints on Box B
belonged to Studebaker and Lucy and one palmprint was that of
Studebaker. The fingerprints on Box C were those of Studebaker

have been relatively fresh, because the carton was constructed of cardboard,

not have been developed by powder.<a id="FNanchor_A10-128" href="#Footnote_A10-128" class="fnanchor">A10-128</a> Tests run by the FBI show that

<p><i>General principles.</i><a id="FNanchor_A10-144" href="#Footnote_A10-144" class="fnanchor">A10-144</a>—The area of questioned document examination
encompasses many types of inquiries, the most familiar of which
is the identification of handwriting. Handwriting identification is
based upon the principle that every person’s handwriting is distinctive.
As Cole testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Q. Mr. Cole, could you explain the basis on which you were
able to make an identification of a questioned writing as being
authored by the person who wrote a standard writing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cole</span>. This is based upon the principle that every handwriting
is distinctive, that since the mental and physical equipment
for producing handwriting is different in every individual,
each person produces his own distinctive writing habits. Of
course, everyone learns to write in the beginning by an endeavor
to repeat ideal letter forms but, practically no one is able to reproduce
these forms exactly. Even though a person might have some
initial success during the active period of instruction, he soon
departs from these and develops his own habits. It may be said
that habit in handwriting is that which makes handwriting possible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span>
Habit is that which makes handwriting efficient. If it
were not for the development of habit, one would be obliged to
draw or sketch.</p>

<p>Some habit would be included even in those efforts. But the
production of handwriting rapidly and fluently always involves
a recording of personal writing habit. This has been confirmed
by observation of a very large number of specimens over a long
period of time, and it has further been demonstrated by, on my
part, having a formal responsibility for rendering decisions about
the identification of handwriting based upon an agreement of
handwriting habit in situations where there would be a rigorous
testing of the correctness of these decision by field investigators,
for example, of the law-enforcement agencies, and a demonstration
that these results were confirmed by other evidence.</p>

<p>This is the basis for identification of handwriting.<a id="FNanchor_A10-145" href="#Footnote_A10-145" class="fnanchor">A10-145</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The same principles are generally applicable to hand printing,<a id="FNanchor_A10-146" href="#Footnote_A10-146" class="fnanchor">A10-146</a> and
in the balance of this section the term “handwriting” will be used to
refer to both cursive or script writing and hand printing.</p>

<p>Not every letter in a questioned handwriting can be used as the
basis of an identification. Most people learn to write letters in a
standard or “copybook” form: a handwriting is distinctive only insofar
as it departs significantly from such forms.<a id="FNanchor_A10-147" href="#Footnote_A10-147" class="fnanchor">A10-147</a> Correspondingly,
not every variation indicates nonidentification; no two acts are precisely
alike and variations may be found within a single document.
Like similarities, variations are significant only if they are distinctive.<a id="FNanchor_A10-148" href="#Footnote_A10-148" class="fnanchor">A10-148</a>
Moreover, since any single distinctive characteristic may not
be unique to one person, in order to make an identification the expert
must find a sufficient number of corresponding distinctive characteristics
and a general absence of distinctive differences.<a id="FNanchor_A10-149" href="#Footnote_A10-149" class="fnanchor">A10-149</a></p>

<p>The possibility that one person could imitate the handwriting of
another and successfully deceive an expert document examiner is very
remote. A forger leaves two types of clue. First, he can seldom perfectly
simulate the letter forms of the victim; concentrating on the
reproduction of one detail, he is likely not to see others. Thus, the
forger may successfully imitate the general form of a letter, but get
proportions or letter connections wrong. In addition, the forger
draws rather than writes. Forged writing is therefore distinguished
by defects in the quality of its line, such as tremor, waver, patching,
retouching, noncontinuous lines, and pen lifts in awkward and unusual
places.<a id="FNanchor_A10-150" href="#Footnote_A10-150" class="fnanchor">A10-150</a></p>

<p>To make a handwriting identification, the handwriting in the document
under examination (the questioned document) is compared
against the handwriting in documents known to have been prepared
by a suspect (the known or standard documents). This is exemplified
by Cole’s examination of Commission Exhibit No. 773, the photograph
of the mail order for the rifle and the envelope in which it was sent:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Q. Now, Mr. Cole, returning to 773, the questioned document,
can you tell the Commission how you formed the conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">569</span>
that it was prepared by the author of the standards, that is,
what steps you followed in your examination and comparison,
what things you considered, what instruments or equipment you
used, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cole</span>. I made first a careful study of the writing on Commission
Exhibit 773 without reference to the standard writing,
in an effort to determine whether or not this writing contained
what I would regard as a basis for identification, contained a
record of writing habit, and as that—as a result of that part of
my examination, I concluded that this is a natural handwriting.
By that I mean that it was made at a fair speed, that it doesn’t
show any evidence of an unnatural movement, poor line quality,
tremor, waver, retouching, or the like. I regard it as being made
in a fluent and fairly rapid manner which would record the
normal writing habits of the person who made it.</p>

<p>I then made a separate examination of the standards, of all
of the standard writings, to determine whether that record gave
a record of writing habit which could be used for identification
purposes, and I concluded that it, too, was a natural handwriting
and gave a good record of writing habit.</p>

<p>I then brought the standard writings together with the questioned
writing for a detailed and orderly comparison, considering
details of letter forms, proportion, pen pressure, letter connections,
and other details of handwriting habit * * *.<a id="FNanchor_A10-151" href="#Footnote_A10-151" class="fnanchor">A10-151</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The standards used by Cole and Cadigan consisted of a wide variety of
documents known to be in the handwriting of Lee Harvey Oswald,
including indorsements on his payroll checks, applications for employment,
for a passport, for membership in the American Civil
Liberties Union, and for a library card, and letters to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, the Marine Corps, the State Department,
and the American Embassy in Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A10-152" href="#Footnote_A10-152" class="fnanchor">A10-152</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr207">The Mail Order for the C2766 Rifle, the Related Envelope,
and the Money Order</h4>

<p>The mail order and envelope for the C2766 rifle were photographed
by Klein’s on microfilm, and then destroyed.<a id="FNanchor_A10-153" href="#Footnote_A10-153" class="fnanchor">A10-153</a> To identify the handwriting
an enlarged photograph was made which showed the handwriting
characteristics with sufficient clarity to form the basis of an
identification.<a id="FNanchor_A10-154" href="#Footnote_A10-154" class="fnanchor">A10-154</a> Based on a comparison with the standards, the
handwriting on the purchase order and the envelope were identified
as Lee Harvey Oswald’s.<a id="FNanchor_A10-155" href="#Footnote_A10-155" class="fnanchor">A10-155</a> The money order, which was retained
by the post office after having been cashed by Klein’s,<a id="FNanchor_A10-156" href="#Footnote_A10-156" class="fnanchor">A10-156</a> was also
identified as being in Oswald’s handwriting.<a id="FNanchor_A10-157" href="#Footnote_A10-157" class="fnanchor">A10-157</a> These identifications
were made on the basis of numerous characteristics in which the writing
in both the questioned and standard documents departed from conventional
letter forms.<a id="FNanchor_A10-158" href="#Footnote_A10-158" class="fnanchor">A10-158</a> For example, in the return address on the
envelope, the left side of the “A” in “A. Hidell” was made by a downstroke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">570</span>
followed by an upstroke which almost exactly traced the down-stroke,
the “i” showed an elongation of the approach stroke and an
exaggerated slant to the right, and the second “l” was somewhat
larger than the first; the “B” in “Box” had an upper lobe smaller
than the lower lobe; the “D” in “Dallas” exhibited a distinctive
construction of the looped form at the top of a letter, and the “s”
was flattened and forced over on its side; and the “x” in “Texas”
was made in the form of a “u” with a cross bar. These characteristics
were also present in the standards.<a id="FNanchor_A10-159" href="#Footnote_A10-159" class="fnanchor">A10-159</a> In addition, these items,
as well as other questioned documents, resembled the standards in
their use of certain erroneous combinations of capital and lowercase
letters.<a id="FNanchor_A10-160" href="#Footnote_A10-160" class="fnanchor">A10-160</a> For example, in the mail order, “Texas” was printed with
a capital “T,” “X,” “A,” and “S,” but a lowercase “e”; a similar
mixture of capital and lowercase letters in “Texas” was found in the
standards.<a id="FNanchor_A10-161" href="#Footnote_A10-161" class="fnanchor">A10-161</a></p>

<p>The writing on the purchase order and envelope showed no significant
evidence of disguise (subject to the qualification that the use of
hand printing on the mail order, rather than handwriting, may have
been used for that purpose).<a id="FNanchor_A10-162" href="#Footnote_A10-162" class="fnanchor">A10-162</a> However, it is not unusual for a
person using an alias not to disguise his writing. For example, Cole,
who is document examiner for the Treasury Department, has frequently
examined forgeries evidencing no attempt at disguise. <a id="FNanchor_A10-163" href="#Footnote_A10-163" class="fnanchor">A10-163</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr208">Mail Order for the V510210 Revolver</h4>

<p>Based on a comparison with the standards, the handwriting on the
mail order<a id="FNanchor_A10-164" href="#Footnote_A10-164" class="fnanchor">A10-164</a> for the V510210 revolver was also identified as Lee
Harvey Oswald’s.<a id="FNanchor_A10-165" href="#Footnote_A10-165" class="fnanchor">A10-165</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr209">Post Office Box Applications and Change-of-Address Card</h4>

<p>A post office box application consists of three parts: The first contains
directions for use. The second provides applicant’s name, address,
signature space, box number, date of opening and closing. The
third part provides instruction space concerning delivery of mail and
names of persons entitled to use the box.<a id="FNanchor_A10-166" href="#Footnote_A10-166" class="fnanchor">A10-166</a> Under post office regulations<a id="FNanchor_A10-167" href="#Footnote_A10-167" class="fnanchor">A10-167</a>
the second part was retained by the Dallas Post Office for box
2915; it destroyed the third part after the box was closed. Based on the
standards, the signature “Lee H. Oswald,” and other handwriting on
the application, was identified as that of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A10-168" href="#Footnote_A10-168" class="fnanchor">A10-168</a> The
postal clerk appeared to have filled in the balance.<a id="FNanchor_A10-169" href="#Footnote_A10-169" class="fnanchor">A10-169</a></p>

<p>The Fort Worth and Dallas post offices retained two change-of-address
orders signed “Lee H. Oswald”: One to “Postmaster, Fort
Worth, Tex.,” dated October 10, 1962, to send mail to “Oswald, Lee
H” at 2703 Mercedes Av., Fort Worth, Texas” and forward to “Box
2915, Dallas, Texas”; the other to “Postmaster, Dallas, Texas” dated
May 12, 1963, requested mail for post office box 2915 be forwarded to
“Lee Oswald” at “4907 Magazine St., New Orleans, La.”<a id="FNanchor_A10-170" href="#Footnote_A10-170" class="fnanchor">A10-170</a> Based
on a comparison with the standards, the handwriting on these orders
was identified as that of Lee Harvey Oswald.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span><a id="FNanchor_A10-171" href="#Footnote_A10-171" class="fnanchor">A10-171</a></p>

<p>The New Orleans post office retained the third part of the application
for post office box 30061, New Orleans, La., dated June 11, 1963,
and signed “L. H. Oswald.” <a id="FNanchor_A10-172" href="#Footnote_A10-172" class="fnanchor">A10-172</a> Inserted in the space for names of
persons entitled to receive mail through the box were written the
names “A. J. Hidell” and “Marina Oswald.” On the basis of a comparison
with the standards, the writing and the signature on the card
was identified as the handwriting of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A10-173" href="#Footnote_A10-173" class="fnanchor">A10-173</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr210">The Spurious Selective Service System Notice of Classification and
U.S. Marine Corps Certificate of Service</h4>

<p>When Oswald was arrested he had in his possession a Selective
Service System notice of classification and a certificate of service in
the U.S. Marine Corps in the name of “Alek James Hidell,” and a
Selective Service System notice of classification, a Selective Service
System registration certificate, and a certificate of service in the U.S.
Marine Corps in his own name.<a id="FNanchor_A10-174" href="#Footnote_A10-174" class="fnanchor">A10-174</a> (See Cadigan Exhibits Nos. 19 and
21, <a href="#Page_573">p. 573</a>.) The Hidell cards where photographic counterfeits.<a id="FNanchor_A10-175" href="#Footnote_A10-175" class="fnanchor">A10-175</a>
After Oswald’s arrest a group of retouched negatives were found in
Mr. Paine’s garage at 2515 West Fifth Street, Irving, Tex.,<a id="FNanchor_A10-176" href="#Footnote_A10-176" class="fnanchor">A10-176</a> among
which were retouched negatives of the Oswald cards.<a id="FNanchor_A10-177" href="#Footnote_A10-177" class="fnanchor">A10-177</a> A comparison
of these retouched negatives with the Hidell and Oswald cards
showed that the Hidell cards had been counterfeited by photographing
the Oswald cards, retouching the resulting negatives, and producing
photographic prints from the retouched negatives.</p>

<h4 id="hdr211">The Hidell Notice of Classification</h4>

<p><i>Face side.</i>—The face of the Hidell notice of classification<a id="FNanchor_A10-178" href="#Footnote_A10-178" class="fnanchor">A10-178</a> was
produced from the face of the Oswald notice of classification<a id="FNanchor_A10-179" href="#Footnote_A10-179" class="fnanchor">A10-179</a> by a
two-step process. First, the counterfeiter photographed the Oswald
notice, making a basic intermediate negative.<a id="FNanchor_A10-180" href="#Footnote_A10-180" class="fnanchor">A10-180</a> He then opaqued
out of this intermediate negative all of the information typed or
handwritten onto the Oswald notice, including the name “Lee Harvey
Oswald,” the selective service No., “41-114-39-532,” the signature of
the official of the local board, and the mailing date. In addition, he
made another intermediate negative of the lowermost third of the
Oswald notice, which contained a printed legend setting forth various
instructions relating to draft board procedures.<a id="FNanchor_A10-181" href="#Footnote_A10-181" class="fnanchor">A10-181</a> This negative reproduced
the printed material exactly, but reduced it in size.<a id="FNanchor_A10-182" href="#Footnote_A10-182" class="fnanchor">A10-182</a> The
two intermediate negatives were combined to produce a third negative,
substantially identical to the basic intermediate negative except that,
by virtue of the reduction in the size of the printed legend, a square
space had been created in the lower left-hand corner.<a id="FNanchor_A10-183" href="#Footnote_A10-183" class="fnanchor">A10-183</a> The counterfeiter
then made a photographic print of this third negative, which
contained blanks wherever typed or handwritten material had appeared
on the original Oswald notice and a new space in the lower left-hand
corner. Finally, new material was inserted into the blanks on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">572</span>
the Hidell notice where typed or handwritten material had appeared
on the Oswald notice.<a id="FNanchor_A10-184" href="#Footnote_A10-184" class="fnanchor">A10-184</a> Thus the name “ALEK JAMES HIDELL,”
the selective service No. “42-224-39-532,” and the mailing date “Feb.
5, 1962,” were typed into the appropriate blanks on the Hidell notice.
Two typewriters were used in this typing, as shown by differences in
the design of the typed figure “4,”<a id="FNanchor_A10-185" href="#Footnote_A10-185" class="fnanchor">A10-185</a> and by differences in the strength
of the typed impression.<a id="FNanchor_A10-186" href="#Footnote_A10-186" class="fnanchor">A10-186</a> Probably the counterfeiter switched typewriters
when he discovered that the ribbon of his first typewriter was
not inked heavily enough to leave a clear impression (a problem
which would have been aggravated by the fact that the glossy photographic
paper used to make the Hidell notice did not provide a good
surface for typewriting).<a id="FNanchor_A10-187" href="#Footnote_A10-187" class="fnanchor">A10-187</a> The face of the notice also bore many
uninked indentations, which could only be made out under strong
side lighting.<a id="FNanchor_A10-188" href="#Footnote_A10-188" class="fnanchor">A10-188</a> These indentations were apparently made with the
typewriter set at stencil—that is, set so that the typewriter key struck
the notice directly, rather than striking it through the inked typewriter
ribbon.<a id="FNanchor_A10-189" href="#Footnote_A10-189" class="fnanchor">A10-189</a> This may have been done as a dry-run practice, to
enable the counterfeiter to determine how to properly center and aline
the inserted material.<a id="FNanchor_A10-190" href="#Footnote_A10-190" class="fnanchor">A10-190</a> A sidelight photograph showed that the names
“ALEK,” “JAMES,” and “HIDELL” had each been typed in stencil
at least twice before being typed in with the ribbon.<a id="FNanchor_A10-191" href="#Footnote_A10-191" class="fnanchor">A10-191</a> A capital letter
“O” had been stenciled prior to one of the stenciled “ALEK’s.”<a id="FNanchor_A10-192" href="#Footnote_A10-192" class="fnanchor">A10-192</a>
A serial number and a date of mailing had also been typed in stencil.<a id="FNanchor_A10-193" href="#Footnote_A10-193" class="fnanchor">A10-193</a></p>

<p>In addition to the typed material, a signature, “Alek J. Hidell,”
was written in ink in the blank provided for the registrant’s signature,
and another, somewhat illegible signature, apparently reading
“Good Hoffer,” was written in ink in the blank provided for the
signature of an official of the local board.<a id="FNanchor_A10-194" href="#Footnote_A10-194" class="fnanchor">A10-194</a> This name differed
from the name written in ink on the Oswald notice, which appeared
to consist of a first name beginning with an “E” or a “G” and the surname
“Schiffen.”<a id="FNanchor_A10-195" href="#Footnote_A10-195" class="fnanchor">A10-195</a> However, the legibility of the name on the Oswald
notice was also quite poor, and the counterfeiter might have been
attempting to duplicate it. A possible reason for deleting the original
name and substituting another is that if the name had not been deleted
it would have been reproduced on the Hidell notice as a photographic
reproduction, which would look less authentic than a
pen-and-ink signature.<a id="FNanchor_A10-196" href="#Footnote_A10-196" class="fnanchor">A10-196</a></p>

<p>Based on a comparison with the handwriting in the standards, the
signature “Alek J. Hidell” on the Hidell notice was identified as
being in the handwriting of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A10-197" href="#Footnote_A10-197" class="fnanchor">A10-197</a> The signature
“Good Hoffer” could not be positively identified, being almost illegible;
however, it was not inconsistent with Oswald’s handwriting.<a id="FNanchor_A10-198" href="#Footnote_A10-198" class="fnanchor">A10-198</a></p>

<p>To complete the face of the Hidell notice a picture of Lee Harvey
Oswald was inserted into the space in the lower left-hand corner
which had been created by reducing the size of the printed legend at
the bottom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span><a id="FNanchor_A10-199" href="#Footnote_A10-199" class="fnanchor">A10-199</a></p>

In creating the face of the Hidell notice, the counterfeiter left
traces which enabled the experts to link together the Hidell notice,
the retouched negatives, and the Oswald notice. To retouch the negatives
the counterfeiter simply painted a red opaque substance on one
side of the negative over the material he wished to delete. When the
negative was printed, the opaquing prevented light from passing
through, so that the print showed blanks wherever the negative had
been opaqued. However, the original material was still clearly visible
on the negative itself.<a id="FNanchor_A10-200" href="#Footnote_A10-200" class="fnanchor">A10-200</a> In addition, at several points the typed or
handwritten material in the Oswald notice had overlapped the printed
material. For example, the signature of the official of the local board
overlapped the letters “re” in the printed word “President,” “l” and
“a” in the printed word “local,” and “viola” in the printed word
“violation.” When this signature was opaqued out, the portions of the
printed material which had been overlapped by the signature were
either removed or mutilated. The consequent distortions were apparent
on both the retouched negative and the Hidell notice itself.
Similarly, the selective service number typed on the Oswald notice
overlapped the margins of the boxes into which it was typed. Although
the counterfeiter opaqued out the numerals themselves, the
margins of the boxes remained thickened at the points where they
had been overlapped by the numerals. These thickened margins were
apparent on both the retouched negative and the Hidell notice.<a id="FNanchor_A10-201" href="#Footnote_A10-201" class="fnanchor">A10-201</a></p>

<p><i>Reverse side.</i>—The reverse side of the Hidell notice, which was
pasted back-to-back to the face, was actually a form of the reverse
side of a Selective Service System registration certificate. Essentially,
it was counterfeited the same way as the face of the notice:
a photograph was made of the reverse side of the Oswald registration
certificate, the material which had been typed or stamped on the Oswald
registration certificate was opaqued out of the resulting negative,
and a photographic print was made from the retouched negative.
This is shown by the negative, in which the opaqued-out information
is still visible, and by defects in the printed material on the Hidell
notice at point where typed-in material had overlapped printed
material on the Oswald registration certificate.<a id="FNanchor_A10-202" href="#Footnote_A10-202" class="fnanchor">A10-202</a></p>

<p>As the final step, new information was typed on the print in the
blanks which resulted from the retouching operation.<a id="FNanchor_A10-203" href="#Footnote_A10-203" class="fnanchor">A10-203</a> Thus “GR”
was substituted for “Blue” under color of eyes; “BROWN” was substituted
for “Brn” under color of hair; “FAIR” was substituted for
“Med.” under complexion; “5” [ft.] “9” [in.] was substituted for “5”
[ft.] “11” [in.] under height; and “155” was substituted for “150”
under weight. The name and address of the local board on the Oswald
registration certificate were opaqued out, but substantially the same
name and address were typed back onto the Hidell notice.<a id="FNanchor_A10-204" href="#Footnote_A10-204" class="fnanchor">A10-204</a> As in the
signature of the local board official on the face of the notice, a possible
reason for deleting the original draft board name and the address and
substituting substantially similar material in its place is that if the
original material had not been deleted it would have reproduced as a
photographic reproduction, which would look much less authentic than
typed-in material.<a id="FNanchor_A10-205" href="#Footnote_A10-205" class="fnanchor">A10-205</a></p>

<p>A limited number of typed uninked indentations are also present.
Thus the indented letters “CT” appear before the letters “GR” (under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">576</span>
color of eyes) and the indented letters “EY” follow “GR.” An indented
“9” appears above the visible “9” for the inch figure of height,
and an indented “i” appears before the weight, “155.” Much of the
typed material on the reverse side of the Hidell notice was not very
legible under ordinary lighting, since it was typed with a typewriter
which left a very weakly inked impression.<a id="FNanchor_A10-206" href="#Footnote_A10-206" class="fnanchor">A10-206</a> In fact, it is difficult to
tell whether some of the material, particularly the word “Brown”
under color of hair, was put in by stencil or by ribbon.</p>

<h4 id="hdr212">The Hidell Certificate of Service</h4>

<p>The face and reverse side of the Hidell certificate of service were
produced from the face and reverse side of the Oswald certificate of
service<a id="FNanchor_A10-207" href="#Footnote_A10-207" class="fnanchor">A10-207</a> by photographing the Oswald certificate, retouching the
resulting negatives to eliminate typed and handwritten material,
and making a photographic print from the retouched negative.<a id="FNanchor_A10-208" href="#Footnote_A10-208" class="fnanchor">A10-208</a>
As in the case of the notice of classification, this is shown by
the negative itself, in which the opaqued-out information is still
visible, and by defects in the printed material on the Hidell
certificate at points where handwritten material had crossed over
printed material on the Oswald certificate. Thus, in the Oswald
certificate the upper portion of the name “Lee” in Oswald’s signature
crosses the letter “u” in the printed word “signature.” The consequent
mutilation of the printed letter “u” can be seen on the Hidell certificate.
Similarly, the ending stroke in the letter “y” in the name “Harvey” in
Oswald’s signature crosses the letter “n” in the printed word
“certifying.” This stroke was not removed at all, and can be seen as a stroke
across the “n” in the Hidell certificate.<a id="FNanchor_A10-209" href="#Footnote_A10-209" class="fnanchor">A10-209</a> As the final step in producing
the Hidell certificate, new material was typed into the blanks
on the photographic print. On the face, the words “ALEK JAMES
HIDELL” were typed into the blank where “LEE HARVEY
OSWALD 1653230” had appeared. A sidelight photograph shows
that these words had been typed in stencil at least twice before being
typed in with the ribbon apparently to determine proper centering
and alignment.<a id="FNanchor_A10-210" href="#Footnote_A10-210" class="fnanchor">A10-210</a> In producing the reverse side of the Hidell certificate,
the signature “Lee Harvey Oswald,” and the dates “24 October 1956”
and “11 September 1959,” showing the beginning and end of the period
of active service, had been opaqued out. No signature was inserted
into resulting blank signature space. However, just below the word
“of” in the printed line “signature of individual,” there are two
vertical indentations which fill about three-fourths of the height of the
signature blank, and a diagonal indentation which slants from
approximately the base of the left vertical to approximately the midpoint
of the right vertical—the total effect being of a printed capital letter
“H.” Also, just below the second and third “i’s” in the printed word
“individual” are two more vertical indentations, which could be the
vertical strokes of “d’s” or “l’s”—although the circular portion of the
letter “d” is not present.<a id="FNanchor_A10-211" href="#Footnote_A10-211" class="fnanchor">A10-211</a> These indentations could have been made
by any sharp instrument, such as a ballpoint pen which was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">577</span>
delivering ink, a stylus of the type used in preparing mimeograph
forms, or even a toothpick.<a id="FNanchor_A10-212" href="#Footnote_A10-212" class="fnanchor">A10-212</a> The indentations are brought out rather
clearly in a sidelight photograph, but can also be seen on the card
itself if the card is held so that light strikes it at an angle.<a id="FNanchor_A10-213" href="#Footnote_A10-213" class="fnanchor">A10-213</a></p>

<p>Into the space for the beginning of active service was typed the date
“OCT. 13 1958.” The space for the end of active service contains
several light-impression and stencil typewriting operations. It was
apparently intended to read “OCT. 12 1961,” but because of the
lightness of the impression and the many stenciled characters, the date is
barely legible.<a id="FNanchor_A10-214" href="#Footnote_A10-214" class="fnanchor">A10-214</a> Interestingly, one of the stenciled impressions in
the blank for end of active service reads “24 October 1959,” as
determined under a microscope, while a stenciled impression in the blank
for beginning of active service reads “24 October 1957.”<a id="FNanchor_A10-215" href="#Footnote_A10-215" class="fnanchor">A10-215</a></p>

<p>The counterfeiting of the Hidell cards did not require great skill,
but probably required an elementary knowledge of photography,
particularly of the photographic techniques used in a printing
plant.<a id="FNanchor_A10-216" href="#Footnote_A10-216" class="fnanchor">A10-216</a> A moderate amount of practice with the technique would
be required—perhaps half a dozen attempts. Practicing retouching
on the balance of the negatives found at the Paine garage would have
been sufficient.<a id="FNanchor_A10-217" href="#Footnote_A10-217" class="fnanchor">A10-217</a> The retouching of the negatives could have been
accomplished without any special equipment. However, the preparation
of the negative, apart from retouching, would probably have
required a very accurate camera, such as would be found in a photographic
laboratory or printing plant.<a id="FNanchor_A10-218" href="#Footnote_A10-218" class="fnanchor">A10-218</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr213">The Vaccination Certificate</h4>

<p>A government-printed form entitled “International Certificates of
Vaccination or Revaccination against Smallpox”<a id="FNanchor_A10-219" href="#Footnote_A10-219" class="fnanchor">A10-219</a> was found among
Oswald’s belongings at his room at 1026 Beckley Avenue, Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_A10-220" href="#Footnote_A10-220" class="fnanchor">A10-220</a>
The form purported to certify that “LEE OSWALD” had been
vaccinated against smallpox on “JUNE 8, 1963” by “DR. A.J.
HIDEEL, P.O. BOX 30016, NEW ORLEANS, LA.” The card
was signed “Lee H. Oswald” and “A. J. Hideel,” and the name and
address “Lee H. Oswald, New Orleans, La.” were hand printed on the
front of the card. All of this material, except the signatures and the
hand printing, had been stamped onto the card. The Hideel name and
address consisted of a three-line stamp—“DR. A. J. HIDEEL/P.O.
BOX 30016/NEW ORLEANS, LA.” A circular, stamped, illegible
impression resembling a seal appeared under a column entitled
“Approved stamp.”<a id="FNanchor_A10-221" href="#Footnote_A10-221" class="fnanchor">A10-221</a></p>

<p>On the basis of a comparison with the standards, Cole identified all
of the handwriting on the vaccination certificate, including the signature
“A. J. Hideel,” as the writing of Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A10-222" href="#Footnote_A10-222" class="fnanchor">A10-222</a> Cadigan
identified all of the writing as Oswald’s except for the “A. J. Hideel”
signature, which in his opinion was too distorted to either identify or
nonidentify as Oswald’s handwriting.<a id="FNanchor_A10-223" href="#Footnote_A10-223" class="fnanchor">A10-223</a> The stamped material on
the certificate was compared with a rubber stamping kit which belonged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">578</span>
to Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A10-224" href="#Footnote_A10-224" class="fnanchor">A10-224</a> In this kit was a rubber stamp with three lines
of print assembled: “L. H. OSWALD/4907 MAGAZINE ST/NEW
ORLEANS, LA.”<a id="FNanchor_A10-225" href="#Footnote_A10-225" class="fnanchor">A10-225</a> Cole found a perfect agreement in measurement
and design between the letters stamped on the certificate and the
letters he examined from Oswald’s rubber stamping kit. However, he
was unable to determine whether the characteristics of Oswald’s rubber
stamping kit were distinctive, and therefore, while he concluded that
Oswald’s rubber stamping kit could have made the rubber stamp
impressions on the certificate, he was unable to say that it was the
only kit which could have made the impressions.<a id="FNanchor_A10-226" href="#Footnote_A10-226" class="fnanchor">A10-226</a> On the basis of
the comparison between the words “NEW ORLEANS, LA.” set up
in the rubber stamp in Oswald’s kit, and the words “NEW
ORLEANS, LA.” on the certificate, Cadigan concluded that these
words had been stamped on the certificate with Oswald’s rubber
stamp. However, he could draw no conclusion as to the remaining
stamped material, which was not directly comparable to the remaining
lines set up on Oswald’s rubber stamp.<a id="FNanchor_A10-227" href="#Footnote_A10-227" class="fnanchor">A10-227</a></p>

<p>On close examination, the circular impression resembling a seal
consisted of the words “BRUSH IN CAN,” printed in reverse.<a id="FNanchor_A10-228" href="#Footnote_A10-228" class="fnanchor">A10-228</a>
Apparently, the impression was made with the top of a container
of solvent or cleaning fluid which bore these words in raised lettering.
In the center of the impression was a mottled pattern which was
similar to the blank areas on a date stamp found in Oswald’s rubber
stamping kit.<a id="FNanchor_A10-229" href="#Footnote_A10-229" class="fnanchor">A10-229</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr214">The Fair Play for Cuba Committee Card</h4>

<p>The Fair Play for Cuba Committee card had two signatures: “L. H.
Oswald” and “A. J. Hidell.” Based on the standards, both Cole and
Cadigan identified “L. H. Oswald” as the signature of Lee Harvey
Oswald,<a id="FNanchor_A10-230" href="#Footnote_A10-230" class="fnanchor">A10-230</a> but both were unable to identify the “A. J. Hidell” signature.<a id="FNanchor_A10-231" href="#Footnote_A10-231" class="fnanchor">A10-231</a>
Cadigan noted differences between the Hidell signature and
Oswald’s handwriting, indicating the possibility that someone other
than Oswald had authored the signature.<a id="FNanchor_A10-232" href="#Footnote_A10-232" class="fnanchor">A10-232</a> Cole believed that the
signature was somewhat beyond Oswald’s abilities as a penman.<a id="FNanchor_A10-233" href="#Footnote_A10-233" class="fnanchor">A10-233</a>
On the basis of a short English interlinear translation written by
Marina Oswald, Cole felt that she might have been the author of the
signature,<a id="FNanchor_A10-234" href="#Footnote_A10-234" class="fnanchor">A10-234</a> but the translation did not present enough of her handwriting
to make possible a positive identification.<a id="FNanchor_A10-235" href="#Footnote_A10-235" class="fnanchor">A10-235</a> In subsequent
testimony before the Commission, Marina stated that she was indeed
the author of the Hidell signature on the card.<a id="FNanchor_A10-236" href="#Footnote_A10-236" class="fnanchor">A10-236</a> Cadigan confirmed
this testimony by obtaining further samples of Marina Oswald’s handwriting
and comparing these samples with the signature on the card.<a id="FNanchor_A10-237" href="#Footnote_A10-237" class="fnanchor">A10-237</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr215">The Unsigned Russian-Language Note</h4>

<p>Cadigan’s examination confirmed Marina’s testimony that the handwriting
in the unsigned note, Commission Exhibit No. 1, was that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">579</span>
Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A10-238" href="#Footnote_A10-238" class="fnanchor">A10-238</a> Since the note was written almost entirely in
the Russian language, which uses the Cyrillic alphabet (as opposed to
the Latin alphabet used in the English language), in making his examination
Cadigan employed not only Oswald’s English language
standards, but also letters written by Oswald in the Russian language.<a id="FNanchor_A10-239" href="#Footnote_A10-239" class="fnanchor">A10-239</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr216">The Homemade Wrapping Paper Bag</h4>

<p>In the absence of watermarks or other distinctive characteristics, it
is impossible to determine whether two samples of paper came from
the same manufacturer.<a id="FNanchor_A10-240" href="#Footnote_A10-240" class="fnanchor">A10-240</a> The homemade paper bag found on the
sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository following the assassination
was made out of heavy brown paper and glue-bearing brown
paper tape, neither of which contained watermarks or other distinctive
characteristics.<a id="FNanchor_A10-241" href="#Footnote_A10-241" class="fnanchor">A10-241</a> However, Cadigan compared the questioned paper
and tape in the paper bag with known paper and tape samples obtained
from the shipping department of the Texas School Book Depository
on November 22, 1963, to see if the questioned items could have come
from the shipping room.<a id="FNanchor_A10-242" href="#Footnote_A10-242" class="fnanchor">A10-242</a> The questioned and known items were examined
visually by normal, incidental, and transmitted natural and
electric light, and under ultraviolet light;<a id="FNanchor_A10-243" href="#Footnote_A10-243" class="fnanchor">A10-243</a> examined microscopically
for surface, paper structure, color, and imperfections;<a id="FNanchor_A10-244" href="#Footnote_A10-244" class="fnanchor">A10-244</a> examined for
their felting pattern, which is the pattern of light and dark areas
caused by the manner in which the fibers become felted at the beginning
stages of paper manufacture;<a id="FNanchor_A10-245" href="#Footnote_A10-245" class="fnanchor">A10-245</a> measured for thickness with
a micrometer sensitive to one one-thousandth of an inch,<a id="FNanchor_A10-246" href="#Footnote_A10-246" class="fnanchor">A10-246</a> subjected
to a fiber analysis to determine the type of fibers of which they were
composed, and whether the fibers were bleached or unbleached;<a id="FNanchor_A10-247" href="#Footnote_A10-247" class="fnanchor">A10-247</a> and
examined spectrographically to determine what metallic ions were
present.<a id="FNanchor_A10-248" href="#Footnote_A10-248" class="fnanchor">A10-248</a> The questioned and known items were identical in all the
properties measured by these tests.<a id="FNanchor_A10-249" href="#Footnote_A10-249" class="fnanchor">A10-249</a> (The width of the tape on the
paper sack was 3 inches, while the width of the sample tape was 2.975,
or twenty-five thousandths of an inch smaller; however, this was not
a significant difference).<a id="FNanchor_A10-250" href="#Footnote_A10-250" class="fnanchor">A10-250</a> In contrast, a paper sample obtained
from the Texas School Book Depository shipping room on December 1,
1963, was readily distinguishable from the questioned paper.<a id="FNanchor_A10-251" href="#Footnote_A10-251" class="fnanchor">A10-251</a></p>

<p>Examination of the tape revealed other significant factors indicating
that it could have come from the Texas School Book Depository
shipping room. There were several strips of tape on the bag.<a id="FNanchor_A10-252" href="#Footnote_A10-252" class="fnanchor">A10-252</a> All
but two of the ends of these strips were irregularly torn; the remaining
two ends had machine-cut edges. This indicated that the person
who made the bag had drawn a long strip of tape from a dispensing
machine and had torn it by hand into several smaller strips.<a id="FNanchor_A10-253" href="#Footnote_A10-253" class="fnanchor">A10-253</a> Confirmation
that the tape had been drawn from a dispensing machine
was supplied by the fact that a series of small markings in the form
of half-inch lines ran down the center of the tape like ties on a railroad
track. Such lines are made by a ridged wheel in a tape dispenser which
is constructed so that when a hand lever is pulled, the wheel, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">580</span>
connected to the lever, pulls the tape from its roll and dispenses it.
Such dispensers are usually found only in commercial establishments.
A dispenser of this type was located in the Texas School Book Depository
shipping room. The length of the lines and the number of
lines per inch on the tape from the paper bag was identical to the
length of the lines and the number of lines per inch on the tape obtained
from the dispenser in the Texas School Book Depository shipping
room.<a id="FNanchor_A10-254" href="#Footnote_A10-254" class="fnanchor">A10-254</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr217">WOUND BALLISTICS EXPERIMENTS</h3>

<h4 id="hdr218">Purpose of the Tests</h4>

<p>During the course of the Commission’s inquiry, questions arose as
to whether the wounds inflicted on President Kennedy and Governor
Connally could have been caused by the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle
found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building
and Western Cartridge Co. bullets and fragments of the type found
on the Governor’s stretcher and in the Presidential limousine. In
analyzing the trajectory of the bullets after they struck their victims,
further questions were posed on the bullet’s velocity and penetration
power after exiting from the person who was initially struck. To
answer these and related questions, the Commission requested that a
series of tests be conducted on substances resembling the wounded portions
of the bodies of President Kennedy and Governor Connally
under conditions which simulated the events of the assassination.</p>

<h4 id="hdr219">The Testers and Their Qualifications</h4>

<p>In response to the Commission’s request, an extensive series of tests
were conducted by the Wound Ballistics Branch of the U.S. Army
Chemical Research and Development Laboratories at Edgewood
Arsenal, Md. Scientists working at that branch are engaged in full-time
efforts to investigate the wound ballistics of missiles in order to
test their effects on substances which simulate live human bodies.<a id="FNanchor_A10-255" href="#Footnote_A10-255" class="fnanchor">A10-255</a>
The tests for the Commission were performed by Dr. Alfred G. Olivier
under the general supervision of Dr. Arthur J. Dziemian with consultation
from Dr. Frederick W. Light, Jr.<a id="FNanchor_A10-256" href="#Footnote_A10-256" class="fnanchor">A10-256</a> Dr. Olivier received his
doctorate in veterinary medicine from the University of Pennsylvania
in 1953. Since 1957 he has been engaged in research on wound ballistics
at Edgewood Arsenal and is now chief of the Wound Ballistics
Branch.<a id="FNanchor_A10-257" href="#Footnote_A10-257" class="fnanchor">A10-257</a> His supervisor, Dr. Dziemian, who is chief of the Biophysics
Division at Edgewood Arsenal, holds a Ph. D. degree from
Princeton in 1939, was a national research fellow in physiology at the
University of Pennsylvania and was a fellow in anatomy at Johns
Hopkins University Medical School.<a id="FNanchor_A10-258" href="#Footnote_A10-258" class="fnanchor">A10-258</a> Since 1947, Dr. Dziemian has
been continuously engaged in wound ballistics work at Edgewood
Arsenal.<a id="FNanchor_A10-259" href="#Footnote_A10-259" class="fnanchor">A10-259</a> In 1930, Dr. Light was awarded an M.D. degree from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">581</span>

the Commission.</p>

<h4 id="hdr220">General Testing Conditions</h4>

<p>The Commission made available to the Edgewood Arsenal scientists
all the relevant facts relating to the wounds which were inflicted on
President Kennedy and Governor Connally including the autopsy
report on the President, and the reports and X-rays from Parkland
Hospital.<a id="FNanchor_A10-262" href="#Footnote_A10-262" class="fnanchor">A10-262</a> In addition, Drs. Olivier and Light had an opportunity
to discuss in detail the Governor’s wounds with the Governor’s
surgeons, Drs. Robert R. Shaw and Charles F. Gregory.<a id="FNanchor_A10-263" href="#Footnote_A10-263" class="fnanchor">A10-263</a> The
Zapruder films of the assassination were viewed with Governor and
Mrs. Connally to give the Edgewood scientists their version.<a id="FNanchor_A10-264" href="#Footnote_A10-264" class="fnanchor">A10-264</a> The
Commission also provided the Edgewood scientists with all known
data on the source of the shots, the rifle and bullets used, and the
distances involved. For purposes of the experiments, the Commission
turned over to the Edgewood testers the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle
found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building.<a id="FNanchor_A10-265" href="#Footnote_A10-265" class="fnanchor">A10-265</a> From information
provided by the Commission, the Edgewood scientists obtained
Western bullets of the type used by the assassin.<a id="FNanchor_A10-266" href="#Footnote_A10-266" class="fnanchor">A10-266</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr221">Tests on Penetration Power and Bullet Stability</h4>

<p>Comparisons were made of the penetrating power of Western bullets
fired from the assassination rifle with other bullets.<a id="FNanchor_A10-267" href="#Footnote_A10-267" class="fnanchor">A10-267</a> From the
Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, the Western bullet was fired through two
gelatin blocks totaling 72½ centimeters in length.<a id="FNanchor_A10-268" href="#Footnote_A10-268" class="fnanchor">A10-268</a> As evidenced
by Commission Exhibit No. 844, which is a photograph from a high-speed
motion picture, the Western bullets passed through 1½ blocks
in a straight line before their trajectory curved.<a id="FNanchor_A10-269" href="#Footnote_A10-269" class="fnanchor">A10-269</a> After coming out
of the second gelatin block, a number of the bullets buried themselves
in a mound of earth.<a id="FNanchor_A10-270" href="#Footnote_A10-270" class="fnanchor">A10-270</a></p>

<p>Under similar circumstances, a bullet described as the NATO round
M-80 was fired from a M-14 rifle.<a id="FNanchor_A10-271" href="#Footnote_A10-271" class="fnanchor">A10-271</a> The penetrating power of the
latter is depicted in Commission Exhibit No. 845 which shows that
bullet possesses much less penetrating power with a quicker tumbling
action. Those characteristics cause an early release of energy which
brings the bullet to a stop at shorter distances.<a id="FNanchor_A10-272" href="#Footnote_A10-272" class="fnanchor">A10-272</a> A further test was
made with a 257 Winchester Roberts soft-nosed hunting bullet as
depicted in Commission Exhibit No. 846. That bullet became deformed
almost immediately upon entering the block of gelatin and
released its energy very rapidly.<a id="FNanchor_A10-273" href="#Footnote_A10-273" class="fnanchor">A10-273</a> From these tests, it was concluded
that the Western bullet fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano
had “terrific penetrating ability” and would retain substantial velocity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">582</span>
after passing through objects such as the portions of the human
body.<a id="FNanchor_A10-274" href="#Footnote_A10-274" class="fnanchor">A10-274</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr222">Tests Simulating President Kennedy’s Neck Wound</h4>

<p>After reviewing the autopsy report on President Kennedy, the
Edgewood scientists simulated the portion of the President’s neck
through which the bullet passed. It was determined that the bullet
traveled through 13½ to 14½ centimeters of tissue in the President’s
neck.<a id="FNanchor_A10-275" href="#Footnote_A10-275" class="fnanchor">A10-275</a> That substance was simulated by constructing three blocks:
one with a 20-percent gelatin composition, a second from one animal
meat and a third from another animal meat.<a id="FNanchor_A10-276" href="#Footnote_A10-276" class="fnanchor">A10-276</a> Those substances
duplicated as closely as possible the portion of the President’s neck
through which the bullet passed.<a id="FNanchor_A10-277" href="#Footnote_A10-277" class="fnanchor">A10-277</a> At the time the tests were conducted,
it was estimated that the President was struck at a range of approximately
180 feet, and the onsite tests which were conducted later at
Dallas established that the President was shot through the neck at
a range of 174.9 feet to 190.8 feet.<a id="FNanchor_A10-278" href="#Footnote_A10-278" class="fnanchor">A10-278</a> At a range of 180 feet, the
Western bullets were fired from the assassination weapon, which has
a muzzle velocity of approximately 2,160 feet per second, through
those substances which were placed beside a break-type screen for
measuring velocity.<a id="FNanchor_A10-279" href="#Footnote_A10-279" class="fnanchor">A10-279</a> The average entrance velocity at 180 feet was
1,904 feet per second.<a id="FNanchor_A10-280" href="#Footnote_A10-280" class="fnanchor">A10-280</a></p>

<p>To reconstruct the assassination situation as closely as possible both
sides of the substances were covered with material and clipped animal
skin to duplicate human skin.<a id="FNanchor_A10-281" href="#Footnote_A10-281" class="fnanchor">A10-281</a> The average exit velocity was 1,779
feet from the gelatin, 1,798 feet from the first animal meat and 1,772
feet from the second animal meat.<a id="FNanchor_A10-282" href="#Footnote_A10-282" class="fnanchor">A10-282</a> Commission Exhibit No. 847
depicts one of the animal meats compressed to 13½ to 14½ centimeters
to approximate the President’s neck and Commission Exhibit
No. 848 shows the analogous arrangement for the gelatin.<a id="FNanchor_A10-283" href="#Footnote_A10-283" class="fnanchor">A10-283</a> The
photograph marked Commission Exhibit No. 849 shows the bullet
passing through the gelatin in a straight line evidencing very stable
characteristics.<a id="FNanchor_A10-284" href="#Footnote_A10-284" class="fnanchor">A10-284</a></p>

<p>Commission Exhibit No. 850 depicts the pieces of clipped animal
skin placed on the points of entry and exit showing that the holes
of entrance are round while the holes of exit are “a little more elongated.”<a id="FNanchor_A10-285" href="#Footnote_A10-285" class="fnanchor">A10-285</a>
From these tests, it was concluded that the bullet lost little
of its velocity in penetrating the President’s neck so that there would
have been substantial impact on the interior of the Presidential limousine
or anyone else struck by the exiting bullet. In addition, these tests
indicated that the bullet had retained most of its stability in penetrating
the President’s neck so that the exit hole would be only
slightly different from the appearance of the entry hole.<a id="FNanchor_A10-286" href="#Footnote_A10-286" class="fnanchor">A10-286</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr223">Tests Simulating Governor Connally’s Chest Wounds</h4>

<p>To most closely approximate the Governor’s chest injuries, the
Edgewood scientists shot an animal with the assassination weapon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">583</span>
using the Western bullets at a distance of 210 feet.<a id="FNanchor_A10-287" href="#Footnote_A10-287" class="fnanchor">A10-287</a> The onsite
tests later determined that the Governor was wounded at a distance
of 176.9 feet to 190.8 feet from the sixth-floor window at the southeast
corner of the Depository Building.<a id="FNanchor_A10-288" href="#Footnote_A10-288" class="fnanchor">A10-288</a> The average striking
velocity of 11 shots at 210 feet was 1,929 feet per second and the average
exit velocity was 1,664 feet per second.<a id="FNanchor_A10-289" href="#Footnote_A10-289" class="fnanchor">A10-289</a></p>

<p>One of the shots produced an injury on the animal’s rib very similar
to that inflicted on Governor Connally.<a id="FNanchor_A10-290" href="#Footnote_A10-290" class="fnanchor">A10-290</a> For purposes of comparison
with the Governor’s wound, the Edgewood scientists studied the
Parkland Hospital report and X-rays, and they also discussed these
wounds with Dr. Shaw, the Governor’s chest surgeon.<a id="FNanchor_A10-291" href="#Footnote_A10-291" class="fnanchor">A10-291</a> The similar
animal injury passed along the animal’s eighth left rib causing
a fracture which removed a portion of the rib in a manner very
similar to the wound sustained by the Governor.<a id="FNanchor_A10-292" href="#Footnote_A10-292" class="fnanchor">A10-292</a> The X-ray of
that wound on the animal is reproduced as Commission Exhibit No.
852.<a id="FNanchor_A10-293" href="#Footnote_A10-293" class="fnanchor">A10-293</a> A comparison with the Governor’s chest wound, shown in
X-ray marked as Commission Exhibit No. 681, shows the remarkable
similarity between those two wounds.<a id="FNanchor_A10-294" href="#Footnote_A10-294" class="fnanchor">A10-294</a></p>

<p>The bullet which produced the wound depicted in Commission Exhibits
Nos. 851 and 852 was marked as Commission Exhibit No. 853
and possessed characteristics very similar to the bullet marked as
Commission Exhibit No. 399 found on Governor Connally’s stretcher
and believed to have been the bullet which caused his chest wound.<a id="FNanchor_A10-295" href="#Footnote_A10-295" class="fnanchor">A10-295</a>
Those bullets, identified as Commission Exhibits Nos. 399 and 853,
were flattened in similar fashion.<a id="FNanchor_A10-296" href="#Footnote_A10-296" class="fnanchor">A10-296</a> In addition, the lead core was
extruded from the rear in the same fashion on both bullets.<a id="FNanchor_A10-297" href="#Footnote_A10-297" class="fnanchor">A10-297</a> One
noticeable difference was that the bullet identified as Commission
Exhibit No. 853, which penetrated the animal, was somewhat more
flat than Commission Exhibit No. 399 which indicated that Commission
Exhibit No. 853 was probably traveling at somewhat greater
speed than the bullet which penetrated the Governor’s chest.<a id="FNanchor_A10-298" href="#Footnote_A10-298" class="fnanchor">A10-298</a> After
the bullet passed through the animal, it left an imprint on the velocity
screen immediately behind the animal which was almost the length
of the bullet indicating that the bullet was traveling sideways or
end over end.<a id="FNanchor_A10-299" href="#Footnote_A10-299" class="fnanchor">A10-299</a> Taking into consideration the extra girth on the
Governor, the reduction in the velocity of the bullet passing through
his body was estimated at 400 feet.<a id="FNanchor_A10-300" href="#Footnote_A10-300" class="fnanchor">A10-300</a> The conclusions from the animal
shots are significant when taken in conjunction with the experiments
performed simulating the injuries to the Governor’s wrist.</p>

<h4 id="hdr224">Tests Simulating Governor Connally’s Wrist Wounds</h4>

<p>Following procedures identical to those employed in simulating
the chest wound, the wound ballistics experts from Edgewood Arsenal
reproduced, as closely as possible, the Governor’s wrist wound. Again
the scientists examined the reports and X-rays from Parkland Hospital
and discussed the Governor’s wrist wound with the attending
orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Charles F. Gregory.<a id="FNanchor_A10-301" href="#Footnote_A10-301" class="fnanchor">A10-301</a> Bone structures
were then shot with Western bullets fired from the assassination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">584</span>
weapon at a distance of 210 feet.<a id="FNanchor_A10-302" href="#Footnote_A10-302" class="fnanchor">A10-302</a> The most similar bone-structure
shot was analyzed in testimony before the Commission. An X-ray
designated as Commission Exhibit No. 854 and a photograph of that
X-ray which appears as Commission Exhibit No. 855 show a fracture
at a location which is very similar to the Governor’s wrist wound
depicted in X-rays marked as Commission Exhibits Nos. 690 and
691.<a id="FNanchor_A10-303" href="#Footnote_A10-303" class="fnanchor">A10-303</a></p>

<p>The average striking velocity of the shots was 1,858 feet per second.<a id="FNanchor_A10-304" href="#Footnote_A10-304" class="fnanchor">A10-304</a>
The average exit velocity was 1,786 feet per second for the
7 out of 10 shots from bone structures which could be measured.<a id="FNanchor_A10-305" href="#Footnote_A10-305" class="fnanchor">A10-305</a>
These tests demonstrated that Governor Connally’s wrist was not
struck by a pristine bullet, which is a missile that strikes an object
before hitting anything else.<a id="FNanchor_A10-306" href="#Footnote_A10-306" class="fnanchor">A10-306</a> This conclusion was based on the following
factors: (1) Greater damage was inflicted on the bone structure
than that which was suffered by the Governor’s wrist;<a id="FNanchor_A10-307" href="#Footnote_A10-307" class="fnanchor">A10-307</a> and (2)
the bone structure had a smaller entry wound and a larger exit wound
which is characteristic of a pristine bullet as distinguished from the
Governor’s wrist which had a larger wound of entry indicating a
bullet which was tumbling with substantial reduction in velocity.<a id="FNanchor_A10-308" href="#Footnote_A10-308" class="fnanchor">A10-308</a>
In addition, if the bullet found on the Governor’s stretcher (Commission
Exhibit No. 399) inflicted the wound on the Governor’s wrist,
then it could not have passed through the Governor’s wrist had it
been a pristine bullet, for the nose would have been considerably flattened,
as was the bullet which struck the bone structure, identified as
Commission Exhibit No. 856.<a id="FNanchor_A10-309" href="#Footnote_A10-309" class="fnanchor">A10-309</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr225">Conclusions From Simulating the Neck, Chest, and Wrist Wounds</h4>

<p>Both Drs. Olivier and Dziemian expressed the opinion that one
bullet caused all the wounds on Governor Connally.<a id="FNanchor_A10-310" href="#Footnote_A10-310" class="fnanchor">A10-310</a> The wound to
the Governor’s wrist was explained by circumstances where the bullet
passed through the Governor’s chest, lost substantial velocity in doing
so, tumbled through the wrist, and then slightly penetrated the Governor’s
left thigh.<a id="FNanchor_A10-311" href="#Footnote_A10-311" class="fnanchor">A10-311</a> Thus, the results of the wound ballistics tests
support the conclusions of Governor Connally’s doctors that all his
wounds were caused by one bullet.<a id="FNanchor_A10-312" href="#Footnote_A10-312" class="fnanchor">A10-312</a></p>

<p>In addition, the wound ballistics tests indicated that it was most
probable that the same bullet passed through the President’s neck
and then proceeded to inflict all the wounds on the Governor. That
conclusion was reached by Drs. Olivier and Dziemian based on the
medical evidence on the wounds of the President and the Governor
and the tests they performed.<a id="FNanchor_A10-313" href="#Footnote_A10-313" class="fnanchor">A10-313</a> It was their opinion that the wound
on the Governor’s wrist would have been more extensive had the bullet
which inflicted that injury merely passed through the Governor’s
chest exiting at a velocity of approximately 1,500 feet per second.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">585</span>
Thus, the Governor’s wrist wound indicated that the bullet passed
through the President’s neck, began to yaw in the air between the
President and the Governor, and then lost substantially more velocity
than 400 feet per second in passing through the Governor’s chest.<a id="FNanchor_A10-314" href="#Footnote_A10-314" class="fnanchor">A10-314</a>
A bullet which was yawing on entering into the Governor’s back would
lose substantially more velocity in passing through his body than a
pristine bullet.<a id="FNanchor_A10-315" href="#Footnote_A10-315" class="fnanchor">A10-315</a> In addition, the greater flattening of the bullet
that struck the animal’s rib (Commission Exhibit No. 853) than the
bullet which presumably struck the Governor’s rib (Commission Exhibit
No. 399) indicates that the animal bullet was traveling at a
greater velocity.<a id="FNanchor_A10-316" href="#Footnote_A10-316" class="fnanchor">A10-316</a> That suggests that the bullet which entered the
Governor’s chest had already lost velocity by passing through the
President’s neck.<a id="FNanchor_A10-317" href="#Footnote_A10-317" class="fnanchor">A10-317</a> Moreover, the large wound on the Governor’s
back would be explained by a bullet which was yawing although that
type of wound might also be accounted for by a tangential striking.<a id="FNanchor_A10-318" href="#Footnote_A10-318" class="fnanchor">A10-318</a></p>

<p>Dr. Frederick W. Light, Jr., the third of the wound ballistics experts,
testified that the anatomical findings alone were insufficient for
him to formulate a firm opinion on whether the same bullet did or
did not pass through the President’s neck first before inflicting all
the wounds on Governor Connally.<a id="FNanchor_A10-319" href="#Footnote_A10-319" class="fnanchor">A10-319</a> Based on the other circumstances,
such as the relative positions in the automobile of the President
and the Governor, Dr. Light concluded that it was probable that
the same bullet traversed the President’s neck and inflicted all the
wounds on Governor Connally.<a id="FNanchor_A10-320" href="#Footnote_A10-320" class="fnanchor">A10-320</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr226">Tests Simulating President Kennedy’s Head Wounds</h4>

<p>Additional tests were performed on inert skulls filled with a 20
percent gelatin substance and then coated with additional gelatin
to approximate the soft tissues overlying the skull.<a id="FNanchor_A10-321" href="#Footnote_A10-321" class="fnanchor">A10-321</a> The skull was
then draped with simulated hair as depicted in Commission Exhibit
No. 860.<a id="FNanchor_A10-322" href="#Footnote_A10-322" class="fnanchor">A10-322</a> Using the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle and the Western
bullets, 10 shots were fired at the reconstructed skulls from a distance
of 270 feet which was the estimated distance at the time those tests
were conducted.<a id="FNanchor_A10-323" href="#Footnote_A10-323" class="fnanchor">A10-323</a> It was later determined through the onsite tests
that President Kennedy was struck in the back of the head at a distance
of 265.3 feet from the assassination weapon.<a id="FNanchor_A10-324" href="#Footnote_A10-324" class="fnanchor">A10-324</a></p>

<p>The general results of these tests were illustrated by the findings
on one skull which was struck at a point most nearly approximating
the wound of entry on President Kennedy’s head.<a id="FNanchor_A10-325" href="#Footnote_A10-325" class="fnanchor">A10-325</a> The whole skull,
depicted in Commission Exhibit No. 860, was struck 2.9 centimeters
to the right and almost horizontal to the occipital protuberance or
slightly above it, which was virtually the precise point of entry on
the President’s head as described by the autopsy surgeons.<a id="FNanchor_A10-326" href="#Footnote_A10-326" class="fnanchor">A10-326</a> That
bullet blew out the right side of the reconstructed skull in a manner
very similar to the head wounds of the President.<a id="FNanchor_A10-327" href="#Footnote_A10-327" class="fnanchor">A10-327</a> The consequences
on that skull are depicted in Commission Exhibits Nos. 861 and 862,
which illustrate the testimony of Dr. Alfred G. Olivier, who supervised
the experiments.<a id="FNanchor_A10-328" href="#Footnote_A10-328" class="fnanchor">A10-328</a> Based on his review of the autopsy report,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">586</span>
Dr. Olivier concluded that the damage to the reconstructed skull was
very similar to the wound inflicted on the President.<a id="FNanchor_A10-329" href="#Footnote_A10-329" class="fnanchor">A10-329</a></p>

<p>Two fragments from the bullet which struck the test skull closely
resembled the two fragments found in the front seat of the Presidential
limousine. The fragment designated as Commission Exhibit
No. 567 is a mutilated piece of lead and copper very similar to a
mutilated piece of copper recovered from the bullet which struck
the skull depicted in Commission Exhibit No. 860. The other fragment,
designated as Commission Exhibit No. 569 which was found
in the front seat of the Presidential limousine, is the copper end of
the bullet.<a id="FNanchor_A10-330" href="#Footnote_A10-330" class="fnanchor">A10-330</a> Commission Exhibit No. 569 is very similar to a copper
fragment of the end of the bullet which struck the test skull.<a id="FNanchor_A10-331" href="#Footnote_A10-331" class="fnanchor">A10-331</a> The
fragments from the test bullet are designated as Commission Exhibit
No. 857 and are depicted in a photograph identified as Commission
Exhibit No. 858.<a id="FNanchor_A10-332" href="#Footnote_A10-332" class="fnanchor">A10-332</a> A group of small lead particles, recovered from
the test bullet, are also very similar to the particles recovered under
the left jump seat and in the President’s head. The particles
from the test bullet are a part of Commission Exhibit No. 857 and are
depicted in photograph designated as Commission Exhibit No. 859.<a id="FNanchor_A10-333" href="#Footnote_A10-333" class="fnanchor">A10-333</a>
That skull was depicted as Commission Exhibit No. 862.<a id="FNanchor_A10-334" href="#Footnote_A10-334" class="fnanchor">A10-334</a></p>

<p>As a result of these tests, Dr. Olivier concluded that the Western
bullet fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle at a distance of 270
feet would make the same type of wound found on the President’s
head.<a id="FNanchor_A10-335" href="#Footnote_A10-335" class="fnanchor">A10-335</a> Prior to the tests, Dr. Olivier had some doubt that such a
stable bullet would cause a massive head wound like that inflicted on
the President.<a id="FNanchor_A10-336" href="#Footnote_A10-336" class="fnanchor">A10-336</a> He had thought it more likely that such a striking
bullet would make small entrance and exit holes.<a id="FNanchor_A10-337" href="#Footnote_A10-337" class="fnanchor">A10-337</a> The tests, however,
showed that the bones of the skull were sufficient to deform the
end of the bullet causing it to expend a great deal of energy and
thereby blow out the side of the skull.<a id="FNanchor_A10-338" href="#Footnote_A10-338" class="fnanchor">A10-338</a> These tests further confirmed
the autopsy surgeons’ opinions that the President’s head wound was
not caused by a dumdum bullet.<a id="FNanchor_A10-339" href="#Footnote_A10-339" class="fnanchor">A10-339</a> Because of the test results, Dr.
Olivier concluded that the fragments found on and under the front
seat of the President’s car most probably came from the bullet which
struck the President’s head.<a id="FNanchor_A10-340" href="#Footnote_A10-340" class="fnanchor">A10-340</a> It was further concluded that the
damage done to Governor Connally’s wrist could not have resulted
from a fragment from the bullet which struck President Kennedy’s
head.<a id="FNanchor_A10-341" href="#Footnote_A10-341" class="fnanchor">A10-341</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr227">HAIRS AND FIBERS</h3>

<p>Testimony on hairs and fibers was given by Paul M. Stombaugh<a id="FNanchor_A10-342" href="#Footnote_A10-342" class="fnanchor">A10-342</a>
of the FBI. Stombaugh has been a specialist in hairs and fibers since
1960, when he began a 1-year period of specialized training in this field.
He has made thousands of hair and fiber examinations, and has testified
in Federal and State courts in approximately 28 States.<a id="FNanchor_A10-343" href="#Footnote_A10-343" class="fnanchor">A10-343</a> Stombaugh
examined and gave testimony on the following objects: (1) The
green and brown blanket found in the Paine’s garage, Commission Exhibit
No. 140; (2) the homemade paper bag found on the sixth floor
of the Texas School Book Depository following the assassination,
Commission Exhibit No. 142; (3) the shirt worn by Oswald on November
22, 1963, Commission Exhibit No. 150; and (4) the C2766 rifle,
Commission Exhibit No. 139.</p>

<p>DIAGRAM OF A HAIR</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">588</span></p>

<h4 id="hdr228">General Principles</h4>

<p><i>Hairs.</i>—As shown in Commission Exhibit No. 666 (<a href="#Page_587">p. 587</a>), a hair
consists of a central shaft of air cells, known as the medulla; a cortex
containing pigment granules (which give the hair its color) and cortical
fusi (air spaces); and a cuticle and an outer layer of scales. Unlike
fingerprints, hairs are not unique. However, human hairs can be distinguished
from animal hairs by various characteristics, including
color, texture, length, medullary structure and shape, shape of pigment,
root size, and scale size. In addition, hairs of the Caucasian, Negroid,
and Mongoloid human races can be distinguished from each other by
color, texture, size and degree of fluctuation of diameter, thickness of
cuticle, shape and distribution of pigment, and shape of cross-section.
Moreover, even though individual hairs are not unique, the expert
usually can distinguish the hairs of different individuals. Thus, Stombaugh,
who had made approximately 1,000 comparison examinations
of Caucasian hairs and 500 comparison examinations of Negroid hairs,
had never found a case in which he was unable to differentiate the hairs
of two different Caucasian individuals, and had found only several
cases in which he could not distinguish, with absolute certainty, between
the hairs of two different Negroid individuals.<a id="FNanchor_A10-344" href="#Footnote_A10-344" class="fnanchor">A10-344</a></p>

<p><i>Fibers.</i>—Like hairs, the various types of natural and artificial fibers
can be distinguished from each other under the microscope. Like hairs
too, individual fibers are not unique, but the expert usually can distinguish
fibers from different fabrics. A major identifying characteristic
of most fibers is color, and under the microscope many different shades
of each color can be differentiated—for example, 50-100 shades of
green or blue, and 25-30 shades of black. The microscopic appearance
of three types of fibers—cotton, wool, and viscose—is illustrated in
Commission Exhibit No. 665 (<a href="#Page_589">p. 589</a>). Two of these, cotton and viscose,
were the subject of testimony by Stombaugh. Cotton is a natural
fiber. Under the microscope, it resembles a twisted soda straw, and the
degree of twist is an additional identifying characteristic of cotton.
Cotton may be mercerized or (more commonly) unmercerized. Viscose
is an artificial fiber. A delustering agent is usually added to viscose
to cut down its luster, and under the microscope this agent appears
as millions of tiny spots on the outside of the fiber. The major identifying
characteristics of viscose, apart from color, are diameter—hundreds
of variations being possible—and size and distribution of
delustering agent, if any.<a id="FNanchor_A10-345" href="#Footnote_A10-345" class="fnanchor">A10-345</a></p>

<p><i>The blanket.</i>—Stombaugh received the blanket, Commission Exhibit
No. 140, in the FBI Laboratory at 7:30 a.m., on November 23, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_A10-346" href="#Footnote_A10-346" class="fnanchor">A10-346</a>
Examination showed that it was composed of brown and green fibers,
of which approximately 1-2 percent were woolen, 20-35 percent
were cotton, and the remainder were delustered viscose.<a id="FNanchor_A10-347" href="#Footnote_A10-347" class="fnanchor">A10-347</a> The viscose
fibers in the blanket were of 10-15 different diameters, and also varied
slightly in shade and in the size and distribution of the delustering
agent. (The apparent cause of those variations was that the viscose in
the blanket consisted of scrap viscose.)<a id="FNanchor_A10-348" href="#Footnote_A10-348" class="fnanchor">A10-348</a> The cotton also varied
in shade, about seven to eight different shades of green cotton being
present, but was uniform in twist.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">589</span><a id="FNanchor_A10-349" href="#Footnote_A10-349" class="fnanchor">A10-349</a></p>

<div id="ip_589" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.3125em;">

<p><span class="smcap">Viscose</span></p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">590</span>
When received by Stombaugh, the blanket was folded into approximately
the shape of a narrow right triangle.<a id="FNanchor_A10-350" href="#Footnote_A10-350" class="fnanchor">A10-350</a> A safety pin was inserted
in one end of the blanket, and also at this end, loosely wrapped
around the blanket, was a string.<a id="FNanchor_A10-351" href="#Footnote_A10-351" class="fnanchor">A10-351</a> On the basis of creases in the
blanket in this area it appeared that the string had been tied around
the blanket rather tightly at one time while something was inside the
blanket.<a id="FNanchor_A10-352" href="#Footnote_A10-352" class="fnanchor">A10-352</a> Other creases and folds were also present, as illustrated in
Commission Exhibit No. 663.<a id="FNanchor_A10-353" href="#Footnote_A10-353" class="fnanchor">A10-353</a> Among these was a crease or hump
approximately 10 inches long.<a id="FNanchor_A10-354" href="#Footnote_A10-354" class="fnanchor">A10-354</a> This crease must have been caused
by a hard protruding object approximately 10 inches long which had
been tightly wrapped in the blanket, causing the yarn to stretch so
that the hump was present even when the object had been extracted.<a id="FNanchor_A10-355" href="#Footnote_A10-355" class="fnanchor">A10-355</a>
The hump was approximately the same length and shape as the telescopic
sight on the C2766 rifle, and its position with respect to the ends
of the blanket was such (based on the manner in which the blanket
was folded when Stombaugh received it) that had the rifle been in the
blanket the telescopic sight could have made the hump.<a id="FNanchor_A10-356" href="#Footnote_A10-356" class="fnanchor">A10-356</a></p>

<p>The string wrapped around the blanket was made of ordinary white
cotton.<a id="FNanchor_A10-357" href="#Footnote_A10-357" class="fnanchor">A10-357</a> It had been tied into a granny knot (a very common knot
tied right over right, right over right) and the dangling ends had
been further tied into a bow knot (the knot used on shoelaces).<a id="FNanchor_A10-358" href="#Footnote_A10-358" class="fnanchor">A10-358</a></p>

<p>After receiving the blanket, Stombaugh scraped it to remove the
foreign textile fibers and hairs that were present.<a id="FNanchor_A10-359" href="#Footnote_A10-359" class="fnanchor">A10-359</a> He found numerous
foreign textile fibers of various types and colors, and a number
of limb, pubic, and head hairs, all of which had originated from persons
of the Caucasian race, and had fallen out naturally, as was shown by
the shape of their roots.<a id="FNanchor_A10-360" href="#Footnote_A10-360" class="fnanchor">A10-360</a> Several of the limb and pubic hairs
matched samples of Oswald’s limb and pubic hairs obtained by the
Dallas police in all observable characteristics, including certain relatively
unusual characteristics.<a id="FNanchor_A10-361" href="#Footnote_A10-361" class="fnanchor">A10-361</a> For example, in both Oswald’s pubic
hairs and some of the blanket pubic hairs, the color was a medium
brown, which remained constant to the tip, where it changed to a very
light brown and then became transparent, due to lack of color pigments;
the diameters were identical, and rather narrow for pubic
hairs; the hairs were very smooth, lacking the knobbiness characteristic
of pubic hairs, and the upper two-thirds were extremely smooth for
pubic hairs; the tips of the hairs were sharp, which is unusual for
pubic hairs; the cuticle was very thin for pubic hairs; the scales displayed
only a very small protrusion; the pigmentation was very fine,
equally dispersed, and occasionally chained together, and displayed
only very slight gapping; cortical fusi were for the most part absent;
the medulla was either fairly continuous or completely absent; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">591</span>
root area was rather clear of pigment, and contained only a fair amount
of cortical fusi, which was unusual.<a id="FNanchor_A10-362" href="#Footnote_A10-362" class="fnanchor">A10-362</a> Similarly, in both Oswald’s
limb hairs and some of the limb hairs from the blanket the color was
light brown through its entire length; the diameter was very fine and
did not noticeably fluctuate; the tips were very sharp, which is unusual;
the scales were of medium size, with very slight protrusion;
there was a very slight gapping of the pigmentation near the cuticle;
there was an unusual amount of cortical fusi, equally distributed
through the hair shaft; and the medulla was discontinuous, granular,
very bulbous, and very uneven.<a id="FNanchor_A10-363" href="#Footnote_A10-363" class="fnanchor">A10-363</a></p>

<p>Other limb, pubic, and head hairs on the blanket did not come from
Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A10-364" href="#Footnote_A10-364" class="fnanchor">A10-364</a></p>

<p><i>The paper bag.</i>—Stombaugh received the paper bag, Commission
Exhibit No. 142, at 7:30 a.m. on November 23, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_A10-365" href="#Footnote_A10-365" class="fnanchor">A10-365</a> No foreign
material was found on the outside of the bag except traces of
fingerprint powder and several white cotton fibers, which were of
no significance, since white cotton is the most common textile, and
at any rate the fibers may have come from Stombaugh’s white cotton
gloves.<a id="FNanchor_A10-366" href="#Footnote_A10-366" class="fnanchor">A10-366</a> Inside the bag were a tiny wood fragment which was
too minute for comparison purposes, and may have come from the
woodpulp from which the paper was made; a particle of a waxy
substance, like candle wax; and a single brown delustered viscose
fiber and several light-green cotton fibers.<a id="FNanchor_A10-367" href="#Footnote_A10-367" class="fnanchor">A10-367</a></p>

<p>The fibers found inside the bag were compared with brown viscose
and green cotton fibers taken from the blanket. The brown viscose fiber
found in the bag matched some of the brown viscose fibers from the
blanket in all observable characteristics, i.e., shade, diameter, and size
and distribution of delustering agent.<a id="FNanchor_A10-368" href="#Footnote_A10-368" class="fnanchor">A10-368</a> The green cotton fibers found
in the bag were, like those from the blanket, of varying shades, but of
a uniform twist. Each green cotton fiber from the bag matched some
of the green cotton fibers from the blanket in all observable characteristics,
i.e., shade and degree of twist. Like the blanket cotton fibers,
the cotton fibers found in the bag were unmercerized.<a id="FNanchor_A10-369" href="#Footnote_A10-369" class="fnanchor">A10-369</a></p>

<p><i>The shirt.</i>—Stombaugh received the shirt, Commission Exhibit No.
150, at 7:30 a.m. on November 23, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_A10-370" href="#Footnote_A10-370" class="fnanchor">A10-370</a> Examination showed that
it was composed of gray-black, dark blue, and orange-yellow cotton
fibers.<a id="FNanchor_A10-371" href="#Footnote_A10-371" class="fnanchor">A10-371</a> The orange-yellow and gray-black cotton fibers were of a
uniform shade, and the dark-blue fibers were of three different
shades.<a id="FNanchor_A10-372" href="#Footnote_A10-372" class="fnanchor">A10-372</a> All the fibers were mercerized and of substantially uniform
degree of twist.<a id="FNanchor_A10-373" href="#Footnote_A10-373" class="fnanchor">A10-373</a></p>

<p><i>The C2766 rifle.</i>—The rifle, Commission Exhibit No. 139, was
received in the FBI Laboratory on the morning of November 23,
1963, and examined for foreign material at that time.<a id="FNanchor_A10-374" href="#Footnote_A10-374" class="fnanchor">A10-374</a> Stombaugh
noticed immediately that the rifle had been dusted for fingerprints,
“and at the time I noted to myself that I doubted very much if
there would be any fibers adhering to the outside of this gun—I
possibly might find some in a crevice some place—because when
the latent fingerprint man dusted this gun, apparently in Dallas,
they use a little brush to dust with they would have dusted any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">592</span>
fibers off the gun at the same time * * *.”<a id="FNanchor_A10-375" href="#Footnote_A10-375" class="fnanchor">A10-375</a> In fact, most of the
fibers Stombaugh found were either adhering to greasy, oily deposits
or were jammed down into crevices, and were so dirty, old, and
fragmented that he could not even determine what type of fibers they
were.<a id="FNanchor_A10-376" href="#Footnote_A10-376" class="fnanchor">A10-376</a> However, Stombaugh found that a tiny tuft of fibers had
caught on a jagged edge on the rifle’s metal butt plate where it met
the end of the wooden stock, and had adhered to this edge, so that when
the rifle had been dusted for fingerprints the brush had folded the tuft
into a crevice between the butt plate and the stock, where it remained.<a id="FNanchor_A10-377" href="#Footnote_A10-377" class="fnanchor">A10-377</a>
Stombaugh described these fibers as “fresh,”<a id="FNanchor_A10-378" href="#Footnote_A10-378" class="fnanchor">A10-378</a> by which he meant
that “they were clean, they had good color to them, there was no
grease on them and they were not fragmented.”<a id="FNanchor_A10-379" href="#Footnote_A10-379" class="fnanchor">A10-379</a> However, it was
not possible to determine how long the fibers had been on the rifle, in
the absence of information as to how frequently the rifle had been
used.<a id="FNanchor_A10-380" href="#Footnote_A10-380" class="fnanchor">A10-380</a> Examination showed that the tuft was composed of six or
seven orange-yellow, gray-black, and dark-blue cotton fibers. These
fibers were compared with fibers from the shirt, Commission Exhibit
No. 150, which was also composed of orange-yellow, gray-black, and
dark-blue cotton fibers. The orange-yellow and gray-black tuft fibers
matched the comparable shirt fibers in all observable characteristics,
i.e., shade and twist. The three dark-blue fibers matched two of the
three shades of the dark-blue shirt fibers, and also matched the
dark-blue shirt fibers in degree of twist.<a id="FNanchor_A10-381" href="#Footnote_A10-381" class="fnanchor">A10-381</a> Based on these facts, Stombaugh
concluded that the tuft of fibers found on the rifle “could easily” have
come from the shirt, and that “there is no doubt in my mind that these
fibers could have come from this shirt. There is no way, however, to
eliminate the possibility of the fibers having come from another
identical shirt.”<a id="FNanchor_A10-382" href="#Footnote_A10-382" class="fnanchor">A10-382</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr229">PHOTOGRAPHS</h3>

<p>Two photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald holding a rifle were found
among Oswald’s possessions in Mrs. Ruth Paine’s garage at 2515 West
Fifth Street, Irving, Tex.<a id="FNanchor_A10-383" href="#Footnote_A10-383" class="fnanchor">A10-383</a> In one, Commission Exhibit No. 133-A,
Oswald is holding the rifle generally in front of his body; in the other,
Commission Exhibit No. 133-B, he is holding the rifle to his right.
Also found at Mrs. Paine’s garage were a negative of 133-B and several
photographs of the rear of General Walker’s house.<a id="FNanchor_A10-384" href="#Footnote_A10-384" class="fnanchor">A10-384</a> An Imperial
reflex camera,<a id="FNanchor_A10-385" href="#Footnote_A10-385" class="fnanchor">A10-385</a> which Marina Oswald testified she used to take
133-A and 133-B, was subsequently produced by Robert Oswald,
Lee Harvey Oswald’s brother.<a id="FNanchor_A10-386" href="#Footnote_A10-386" class="fnanchor">A10-386</a> Testimony concerning the photographs,
the negative, and the camera was given by Lyndal D. Shaneyfelt
of the FBI.<a id="FNanchor_A10-387" href="#Footnote_A10-387" class="fnanchor">A10-387</a> Shaneyfelt has been connected with photographic
work since 1937. He has made 100-300 photographic examinations,
and has testified frequently on the subject in court.<a id="FNanchor_A10-388" href="#Footnote_A10-388" class="fnanchor">A10-388</a></p>

<p><i>Photographs 133-A and 133-B.</i>—The background and lighting in
133-A and 133-B are virtually identical; the only apparent difference
between the two photographs is the pose. However, in 133-A the rifle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">593</span>
is held in a position showing many more of its characteristics than
are shown in 133-B.<a id="FNanchor_A10-389" href="#Footnote_A10-389" class="fnanchor">A10-389</a> In order to bring out the details in the rifle
pictured in 133-A, Shaneyfelt rephotographed 133-A and prepared
prints of varying densities from the new negative.<a id="FNanchor_A10-390" href="#Footnote_A10-390" class="fnanchor">A10-390</a> He also took two
new photographs of the C2766 rifle itself: one shows the rifle in approximately
the same position as the rifle pictured in 133-A. The other
shows a man holding the rifle simulating the pose in 133-A.<a id="FNanchor_A10-391" href="#Footnote_A10-391" class="fnanchor">A10-391</a> Shaneyfelt
compared the actual rifle, the photograph 133-A, his rephotographs
of 133-A, and the two new photographs to determine whether
the rifle pictured in 133-A was the C2766 rifle. He found it to be the
same in all appearances, noted no differences, and found a notch in the
stock of the C2766 which also appeared very faintly in 133-A. However,
he did not find enough peculiarities to positively identify the
rifle in 133-A as the C2766 rifle, as distinguished from other rifles of
the same configuration.<a id="FNanchor_A10-392" href="#Footnote_A10-392" class="fnanchor">A10-392</a></p>

<p>The rifle’s position in 133-B is such that less of its characteristics
were visible than in 133-A; essentially, 133-B shows only the bottom
of the rifle. However, the characteristics of the rifle visible in 133-B
are also similar to the observable characteristics of the C2766 rifle,
except that while the C2766 rifle was equipped with a homemade
leather sling when it was found after the assassination, the rifle in
133-B seems to be equipped with a homemade rope sling.<a id="FNanchor_A10-393" href="#Footnote_A10-393" class="fnanchor">A10-393</a> The portion
of the sling visible in 133-A is too small to establish whether it is
rope or leather, but it has the appearance of rope, and its configuration
is consistent with the rope sling pictured in 133-B.<a id="FNanchor_A10-394" href="#Footnote_A10-394" class="fnanchor">A10-394</a></p>

<p><i>The negative.</i>—Shaneyfelt’s examination of the negative, Commission
Exhibit No. 749, showed that the photograph, 133-B, had been
printed directly or indirectly from the negative. It was Shaneyfelt’s
opinion that 133-B had been directly from the negative, but he could
not absolutely eliminate the possibility of an internegative, that is, the
possibility that a print had been produced from the negative 749, a
photograph had been taken of that print, and 133-B had been produced
from the new negative, rather than from the original negative.<a id="FNanchor_A10-395" href="#Footnote_A10-395" class="fnanchor">A10-395</a>
“I think this is highly unlikely, because if this were the result
of a copied negative, there would normally be evidence that I could
detect, such as a loss of detail and imperfections that show up due to the
added process.”<a id="FNanchor_A10-396" href="#Footnote_A10-396" class="fnanchor">A10-396</a> In any event, any “intermediate” print would
have been virtually indistinguishable from 133-B, so that Shaneyfelt’s
testimony conclusively established that either 133-B or a virtually
indistinguishable print had been produced from the negative 749.</p>

aperture.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">595</span>
<i>The camera.</i>—The Imperial camera, Commission Exhibit No. 750,
was a relatively inexpensive, fixed-focus, one-shutter-speed, box-type
camera, made in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A10-397" href="#Footnote_A10-397" class="fnanchor">A10-397</a> Shaneyfelt compared this
camera with the negative, Commission Exhibit No. 749, to determine
whether this negative had been taken with the camera.<a id="FNanchor_A10-398" href="#Footnote_A10-398" class="fnanchor">A10-398</a> To make this
determination, Shaneyfelt compared the margins of the image on Commission
Exhibit No. 749 with the margins of the image on a negative
he himself had taken with the camera. Microscopic examination shows
that the margins of a negative’s image, although apparently straight,
are actually irregular. The irregularities usually do not show on a
finished print, because they are blocked out to give the print a neat
border.<a id="FNanchor_A10-399" href="#Footnote_A10-399" class="fnanchor">A10-399</a> The cause of these irregularities can be best understood
by examination of Commission Exhibit No. 751 (<a href="#Page_594">p. 594</a>), a photograph
of the Imperial camera with the back removed to show the camera’s
film-plane aperture. When the camera’s shutter is opened, light exposes
that portion of the film which is not blocked off by this aperture.
The edges of the aperture, therefore, define the edges of the image
which will appear on the developed negative. In effect, the edge of
the image is a shadowgraph of the edge of the aperture. As Shaneyfelt
testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * the basis of the examination was a close microscopic study
of the negative made in the camera to study the shadowgraph that
is made of the edge of the aperture.</p>

<p>As the film is placed across the aperture of the camera, and the
shutter is opened, light comes through and exposes the film only
in the opening within the edges. Where the film is out over the
edges of the aperture it is not exposed, and your result is an exposed
negative with a clear edge, and on the negative then, the
edges of that exposure of the photograph, are actually shadowgraphs
of the edges of the aperture.<a id="FNanchor_A10-400" href="#Footnote_A10-400" class="fnanchor">A10-400</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The basis of the identification is that the microscopic characteristics
of every film-plane aperture, like those of a rifle barrel, are distinctive,
for much the same reason; that is, when the camera is manufactured,
certain handwork is done which differs microscopically from camera
to camera, and further differences accrue as the camera is used. As
Shaneyfelt testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Q. Mr. Shaneyfelt, what is the basis of your statement, the theoretical
basis of your statement, that every camera with this type
of back aperture arrangement is unique in the characteristics of
the shadowgraph it makes on the negative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. It is because of the minute variations that
even two cameras from the same mold will have. Additional
handwork on cameras, or filing the edges where a little bit of plastic
or a little bit of metal stays on, make individual characteristics
apart from those that would be general characteristics on all of
them from the same mold.</p>

<p>In addition, as the film moves across the camera and it is used
for a considerable length of time, dirt and debris tend to accumulate
a little—or if the aperture is painted, little lumps in the paint
will make little bumps along that edge that would make that then
individually different from every other camera.</p>

<p>Q. Is this similar then to toolmark identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shaneyfelt</span>. Very similar; yes.<a id="FNanchor_A10-401" href="#Footnote_A10-401" class="fnanchor">A10-401</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">596</span>
Based on his examination of the shadowgraph on the negative,
Commission Exhibit No. 749, Shaneyfelt determined that it had been
taken with the Imperial camera.<a id="FNanchor_A10-402" href="#Footnote_A10-402" class="fnanchor">A10-402</a></p>

<p>Three edges of the shadowgraph of the film-plane aperture were
also visible on one of the photographs of General Walker’s house, not
having been blocked out in the making of the print. On the basis
of these three margins, Shaneyfelt determined that this photograph
had also been taken with Oswald’s Imperial Reflex camera. Shaneyfelt
could not determine whether 133-A had been photographed with
the Imperial camera, because the negative of 133-A had not been
found, and the print itself did not show a shadowgraph area.<a id="FNanchor_A10-403" href="#Footnote_A10-403" class="fnanchor">A10-403</a></p>

<p>During his interrogations Oswald had been shown 133-A, and had
claimed it was a composite—that the face in the picture was his, but
the body was not.<a id="FNanchor_A10-404" href="#Footnote_A10-404" class="fnanchor">A10-404</a> Shaneyfelt examined 133-A and 133-B to
determine if they were composite pictures. He concluded that they
were not:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * it is my opinion that they are not composites. Again
with very, very minor reservation, because I cannot entirely eliminate
an extremely expert composite. I have examined many composite
photographs, and there is always an inconsistency, either
in lighting of the portion that is added, or the configuration indicating
a different lens used for the part that was added to the
original photograph, things many times that you can’t point to
and say this is a characteristic, or that is a characteristic, but they
have definite variations that are not consistent throughout the
picture.</p>

<p>I found no such characteristics in this picture.</p>

<p>In addition, with a composite it is always necessary to make a
print that you then make a pasteup of. In this instance paste the
face in, and rephotograph it, and then retouch out the area where
the head was cut out, which would leave a characteristic that would
be retouched out on the negative and then that would be printed.</p>

<p>Normally, this retouching can be seen under magnification in
the resulting composite—points can be seen where the edge of
the head had been added and it hadn’t been entirely retouched
out.</p>

<p>This can nearly always be detected under magnification. I
found no such characteristics in these pictures.</p>

<p>Q. Did you use the technique of magnification in your analysis?</p>

<p>A. Yes.<a id="FNanchor_A10-405" href="#Footnote_A10-405" class="fnanchor">A10-405</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, the negative, Commission Exhibit No. 749, showed
absolutely no doctoring or composition.<a id="FNanchor_A10-406" href="#Footnote_A10-406" class="fnanchor">A10-406</a> Since the negative was
made in Oswald’s Imperial camera, Commission Exhibit No. 750, a
composite of 133-B could have been made only by putting two pictures
together and rephotographing them in the Imperial camera—all without
leaving a discernible trace. This, to Shaneyfelt, was “in the realm
of the impossible”:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">597</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In addition, in this instance regarding 133-B which I have
just stated, I have identified as being photographed or exposed
in the camera which is Exhibit 750, for this to be a
composite, they would have had to make a picture of the background
with an individual standing there, and then substitute
the face, and retouch it and then possibly rephotograph it
and retouch that negative, and make a print, and then photograph
it with this camera, which is Commission Exhibit 750, in
order to have this negative which we have identified with the
camera, and is Commission Exhibit 749.</p>

<p>This to me is beyond reasonable doubt, it just doesn’t seem that
it would be at all possible, in this particular photograph.<a id="FNanchor_A10-407" href="#Footnote_A10-407" class="fnanchor">A10-407</a></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Q. You have the negative of this? [Referring to Exhibit
133B.]</p>

<p>A. We have the negative of 133B.</p>

<p>Q. You have the negative of 133B. That negative in itself
shows no doctoring or composition at all?</p>

<p>A. It shows absolutely no doctoring or composition.</p>

<p>Q. So that the only composition that could have been made
would have been in this process which you have described of picture
on picture and negative and then photographing?</p>

<p>A. And then finally rephotographing with this camera.</p>

<p>Q. Rephotographing with this camera, this very camera?</p>

<p>A. That is correct, and this then, to me, becomes in the realm
of the impossible.<a id="FNanchor_A10-408" href="#Footnote_A10-408" class="fnanchor">A10-408</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Following the assassination, photographs similar to 133-A appeared
in a number of newspapers and magazines.<a id="FNanchor_A10-409" href="#Footnote_A10-409" class="fnanchor">A10-409</a> At least some
of these photographs, as reproduced, differed both from 133-A and
from each other in minor details.<a id="FNanchor_A10-410" href="#Footnote_A10-410" class="fnanchor">A10-410</a> Shaneyfelt examined several of
these reproductions and concluded that in each case the individual
publisher had taken a reproduction of 133-A and retouched it in various
ways, apparently for clarifying purposes, thus accounting for
the differences between the reproductions and 133-A, and the differences
between the reproductions themselves.<a id="FNanchor_A10-411" href="#Footnote_A10-411" class="fnanchor">A10-411</a> Subsequently one of the
publishers involved submitted the original photographs which it had
retouched. Shaneyfelt’s examination of this photograph confirmed
his original conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_A10-412" href="#Footnote_A10-412" class="fnanchor">A10-412</a> The remaining publishers either confirmed
that they had retouched the photographs they had used, or failed to
contradict Shaneyfelt’s testimony after having been given an opportunity
to do so.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">598</span><a id="FNanchor_A10-413" href="#Footnote_A10-413" class="fnanchor">A10-413</a></p>

<span class="subhead">Reports Relating to the Interrogation of Lee Harvey
Oswald at the Dallas Police Department</span></h2>
</div>

<p>As discussed in chapters IV and V, Lee Harvey Oswald was interrogated
for a total of approximately 12 hours between 2:30 p.m. on
Friday, November 22, 1963, and 11:15 a.m. on Sunday, November 24,
1963. There were no stenographic or tape recordings of these interviews.
Several of the investigators present at one or more of the
interrogation sessions, prior to testifying before the Commission, had
prepared memoranda setting forth their recollections of the questioning
of Oswald and his responses. The following are the most
important of these reports.</p>

<hr class="sec" />
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">599</span></p>

<h3 class="newpage">REPORT OF CAPT. J. W. FRITZ, DALLAS POLICE
DEPARTMENT</h3>

<p class="p1 center">INTERROGATION OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD</p>

<p>We conducted the investigation at the Texas Book Depository
Building on November 22, 1963, immediately after the President was shot
and after we had found the location where Lee Harvey Oswald had done the
shooting from and left three empty cartridge cases on the floor and the
rifle had been found partially hidden under some boxes near the back
stairway. These pieces of evidence were protected until the Crime Lab
could get pictures and make a search for fingerprints. After Lt. Day,
of the Crime Lab, had finished his work with the rifle, I picked it up
and found that it had a cartridge in the chamber, which I ejected. About
this time some officer came to me and told me that Mr. Roy S. Truly
wanted to see me, as one of his men had left the building. I had talked
to Mr. Truly previously, and at that time he thought everyone was accounted
for who worked in the building. Mr. Truly then came with another
officer and told me that a Lee Harvey Oswald had left the building. I
asked if he had an address where this man lived, and he told me that he
did, that it was in Irving at 2515 W. 5th Street.</p>

<p>I then left the rest of the search of the building with Chief
Lumpkin and other officers who were there and told Dets. R. K. Sims and
E. L. Boyd to accompany me to the City Hall where we could make a quick check
for police record and any other information of value, and we would then go
to Irving, Texas, in an effort to apprehend this man. While I was in the
building, I was told that Officer J. D. Tippit had been shot in Oak Cliff.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">600</span>
Immediately after I reached my office, I asked the officers who had brought
in a prisoner from the Tippit shooting who the man was who shot the officer.
They told me his name was Lee Harvey Oswald, and I replied that that was
our suspect in the President’s killing. I instructed the officers to bring
this man into the office after talking to the officers for a few minutes
in the presence of Officers R. M. Sims and E. L. Boyd of the Homicide Bureau
and possibly some Secret Service men. Just as I had started questioning
this man, I received a call from Gordon Shanklin, Agent in Charge of the
FBI office here in Dallas, who asked me to let him talk to Jim Bookhout,
one of his agents. He told Mr. Bookhout that he would like for James P.
Hosty to sit in on this interview as he knew about these people and had
been investigating them before. I invited Mr. Bookhout and Mr. Hosty in
to help with the interview.</p>

<p>After some questions about this man’s full name I asked him if he
worked for the Texas School Book Depository, and he told me he did. I
asked him which floor he worked on, and he said usually on the second
floor but sometimes his work took him to all the different floors. I asked
him what part of the building he was in at the time the President was
shot, and he said that he was having his lunch about that time on the first
floor. Mr. Truly had told me that one of the police officers had stopped
this man immediately after the shooting somewhere near the back stairway,
so I asked Oswald where he was when the police officer stopped him. He
said he was on the second floor drinking a coca cola when the officer came
in. I asked him why he left the building, and he said there was so much
excitement he didn’t think there would be any more work done that day, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">601</span>
that as this company wasn’t particular about their hours, that they did not
punch a clock, and that he thought it would be just as well that he left for
the rest of the afternoon. I asked him if he owned a rifle, and he said
that he did not. He said that he had seen one at the building a few days
ago, and that Mr. Truly and some of the employees were looking at it. I
asked him where he went to when he left work, and he told me that he had
a room on 1026 North Beckley, that he went over there and changed his trousers
and got his pistol and went to the picture show. I asked him why he carried
his pistol, and he remarked, “You know how boys do when they have a gun, they
just carry it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hosty asked Oswald if he had been in Russia. He told him, “Yes,
he had been in Russia three years.” He asked him if he had written to
the Russian Embassy, and he said he had. This man became very upset and
arrogant with Agent Hosty when he questioned him and accused him of accosting
his wife two different times. When Agent Hosty attempted to talk to
this man, he would hit his fist on the desk. I asked Oswald what he meant
by accosting his wife when he was talking to Mr. Hosty. He said Mr. Hosty
mistreated his wife two different times when he talked with her, practically
accosted her. Mr. Hosty also asked Oswald if he had been to Mexico City,
which he denied. During this interview he told me that he had gone to
school in New York and in Fort Worth, Texas, that after going into the
Marines, finished his high school education. I asked him if he won any
medals for rifle shooting in the Marines. He said he won the usual medals.</p>

<p>I asked him what his political beliefs were, and he said he had none
but that he belonged to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and told me that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">602</span>
they had headquarters in New York and that he had been Secretary for this
organization in New Orleans when he lived there. He also said that he supports
the Castro Revolution. One of the officers had told me that he had
rented the room on Beckley under the name of O. F. Lee. I asked him why
he did this. He said the landlady did it. She didn’t understand his
name correctly.</p>

<p>Oswald asked if he was allowed an attorney and I told him he could
have any attorney he liked, and that the telephone would be available to him
up in the jail and he could call anyone he wished. I believe it was during
this interview that he first expressed a desire to talk to Mr. Abt, an
attorney in New York. Interviews on this day were interrupted by showups
where witnesses identified Oswald positively as the man who killed Officer
Tippit, and the time that I would have to talk to another witness or to
some of the officers. One of these showups was held at 4:35 pm and the
next one at 6:30 pm, and at 7:55 pm. At 7:05 pm I signed a complaint before
Bill Alexander of the District Attorney’s office, charging Oswald with
the Tippit murder. At 7:10 pm Tippit was arraigned before Judge Johnston.
During the second interview I asked Oswald about a card that he had in
his purse showing that he belonged to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which
he admitted was his. I asked him about another identification card in his
pocket bearing the name of Alex Hidell. He said he picked up that name
in New Orleans while working in the Fair Play for Cuba organization. He
said he spoke Russian, that he corresponded with people in Russia, and that
he received newspapers from Russia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">603</span>
I showed the rifle to Marina Oswald, and she could not positively
identify it, but said that it looked like the rifle that her husband had
and that he had been keeping it in the garage at Mrs. Paine’s home in
Irving. After this, I questioned Oswald further about the rifle, but he
denied owning a rifle at all, and said that he did have a small rifle
some years past. I asked him if he owned a rifle in Russia, and he said,
“You know you can’t buy a rifle in Russia, you can only buy shotguns.
I had a shotgun in Russia and hunted some while there.” Marina Oswald
had told me that she thought her husband might have brought the rifle
from New Orleans, which he denied. He told me that he had some things
stored in a garage at Mrs. Paine’s home in Irving and that he had a few
personal effects at his room on Beckley. I instructed the officers to
make a thorough search of both of these places.</p>

<p>After reviewing all of the evidence pertaining to the killing
of President Kennedy before District Attorney Henry Wade and his assistant,
Bill Alexander, and Jim Allen, former First Assistant District
Attorney of Dallas County, I signed a complaint before the District
Attorney charging Oswald with the murder of President Kennedy. This was
at 11:26 pm. He was arraigned before Judge David Johnston at 1:35 am,
November 23, 1963.</p>

<p>Oswald was placed in jail about 12:00 midnight and brought from the
jail for arraignment before Judge David Johnston at 1:36 am.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">604</span>
On November 23 at 10:25 AM Oswald was brought from the jail for
an interview. Present at this time was FBI agent Jim Bookhout, Forrest
Sorrells, special agent and in charge of Secret Service, United States
Marshall Robert Nash, and Homicide officers. During this interview I
talked to Oswald about his leaving the building and he told me he
left by bus and rode to a stop near home and walked on to his house.
At the time of Oswald’s arrest he had a bus transfer in his pocket.
He admitted this was given to him by the bus driver when he rode the
bus after leaving the building.</p>

<p>One of the officers had told me that a cab driver, William Wayne
Whaley, thought he had recognized Oswald’s picture as the man who had
gotten in his cab near the bus station and rode to Becklay Avenue. I
asked Oswald if he had ridden a cab on that day, and he said, “Yes, I
did ride in the cab. The bus I got on near where I work got into
heavy traffic and was traveling too slow, and I got off and caught a
cab.” I asked him about his conversation with the cab driver, and he
said he remembered that when he got in the cab a lady came up who also
wanted a cab, and he told Oswald to tell the lady to “take another cab”.</p>

<p>We found from the investigation the day before that when Oswald
left home, he was carrying a long package. He usually went to see his
wife of week ends, but this time he had gone on Thursday night. I
asked him if he had told Buell Wesley Frazier why he had gone home a
different night, and if he had told him anything about bringing back
some curtain rods. He denied it.</p>

<p>During this conversation he told me he reached his home by cab
and changed both his shirt and trousers before going to the show. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_605">605</span>
said his cab fare home was 85 cents. When asked what he did with his
clothing he took off when he got home, he said he put them in the dirty
clothes. In talking with him further about his location at the time the
President was killed, he said he ate lunch with some of the colored boys who
worked with him. One of them was called “Junior” and the other one was
a little short man whose name he did not know. He said he had a cheese
sandwich and some fruit and that was the only package he had brought with
him to work and denied that he had brought the long package described by
Mr. Frazier and his sister.</p>

<p>I asked him why he lived in a room, while his wife lived in Irving.
He said Mrs. Paine, the lady his wife lived with, was learning Russian,
that his wife needed help with the young baby, and that it made a nice
arrangement for both of them. He said he didn’t know Mr. Paine very
well, but Mr. Paine and his wife, he thought, were separated a great deal
of the time. He said he owned no car, but that the Paines have two cars,
and told that in the garage at the Paine’s home he had some sea bags that
had a lot of his personal belongings, that he had left them there after
coming back from New Orleans in September.</p>

<p>He said he had a brother, Robert, who lived in Fort Worth. We
later found that this brother lived in Denton. He said the Paines were
close friends of his.</p>

<p>I asked him if he belonged to the Communist Party, but he said
that he had never had a card, but repeated that he belonged to the Fair
Play for Cuba organization, and he said that he belonged to the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">606</span>
Civil Liberties Union and paid $5.00 dues. I asked him again why he
carried the pistol to the show. He refused to answer questions about
the pistol. He did tell me, however, that he had bought it several
months before in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>

<p>I noted that in questioning him that he did answer very quickly,
and I asked him if he had ever been questioned before, and he told me
that he had. He was questioned one time for a long time by the FBI
after he had returned from Russia. He said they used different methods,
they tried the hard and soft, and the buddy method, and said he was very
familiar with interrogation. He reminded me that he did not have to
answer any questions at all until he talked to his attorney, and I
told him again that he could have an attorney any time he wished.
He said he didn’t have money to pay for a phone call to Mr. Abt. I
told him to call “collect”, if he liked, to use the jail phone or that
he could have another attorney if he wished. He said he didn’t want
another attorney, he wanted to talk to this attorney first. I believe
he made this call later as he thanked me later during one of our interviews
for allowing him the use of the telephone. I explained to him
that all prisoners were allowed to use the telephone. I asked him why
he wanted Mr. Abt, instead of some available attorney. He told me he
didn’t know Mr. Abt personally, but that he was familiar with a case
where Mr. Abt defended some people for a violation of the Smith Act,
and that if he didn’t get Mr. Abt, that he felt sure the American Civil
Liberties Union would furnish him a lawyer. He explained to me that
this organization helped people who needed attorneys and weren’t able
to get them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_607">607</span>
While in New Orleans, he lived at 1907 Magazine Street and at one
time worked for the William Riley Company near that address. When asked
about any previous arrests, he told me that he had had a little trouble
while working with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and had a fight with
some anti-Castro people. He also told me of a debate on some radio
station in New Orleans where he debated with some anti-Castro people.</p>

<p>I asked him what he thought of President Kennedy and his family,
and he said he didn’t have any views on the President. He said, “I like
the President’s family very well. I have my own views about national
policies.” I asked him about a polygraph test. He told me he had refused
a polygraph test with the FBI, and he certainly wouldn’t take one
at this time. Both Mr. Bookhout, of the FBI, and Mr. Kelley, and the
Marshall asked Oswald some questions during this interview.</p>

<p>Oswald was placed back in jail at 11:33 am. At 12:35 pm Oswald
was brought to the office for another interview with Inspector Kelley and
some of the other officers and myself. I talked to Oswald about the
different places he had lived in Dallas in an effort to find where he was
living when the picture was made of him holding a rifle which looked to
be the same rifle we had recovered. This picture showed to be taken
near a stairway with many identifying things in the back yard. He told
me about one of the places where he had lived.</p>

<p>Mr. Paine had told me about where Oswald lived on Neely Street.
Oswald was very evasive about this location. We found later that this
was the place where the picture was made. I again asked him about his property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">608</span>
and where his things might be kept, and he told me about the things at
Mrs. Paine’s residence and a few things on Beckley. He was placed
back in jail at 1:10 PM.</p>

<p>At 6:00 PM I instructed the officers to bring Oswald back into
the office, and in the presence of Jim Bookhout, Homicide officers,
and Inspector Kelley, of the Secret Service, I showed Oswald an enlarged
picture of him holding a rifle and wearing a pistol. This
picture had been enlarged by our Crime Lab from a picture found in
the garage at Mrs. Paine’s house. He said the picture was not his,
that the face was his face, but that this picture had been made by
someone superimposing his face, the other part of the picture was
not him at all and that he had never seen the picture before. When
I told him that the picture was recovered from Mrs. Paine’s garage,
he said that the picture had never been in his possession, and I explained
to him that it was an enlargement of the small picture obtained in
the search. At that time I showed him the smaller picture. He
denied ever seeing that picture and said that he knew all about
photography, that he had done a lot of work in photography himself,
that the small picture was a reduced picture of the large picture,
and had been made by some person unknown to him. He further stated
that since he had been photographed here at the City Hall and that
people had been taking his picture while being transferred from my
office to the jail door that someone had been able to get a picture
of his face and that with that, they had made this picture. He told
me that he understood photography real well, and that in time, he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609">609</span>
be able to show that it was not his picture, and that it had been made
by someone else. At this time he said that he did not want to answer
any more questions and he was returned to the jail about 7:15 pm.</p>

<p>At 9:30 on the morning of November 24, I asked that Oswald be
brought to the office. At that time I showed him a map of the City of
Dallas which had been recovered in the search of his room on North Beckley.
This map had some markings on it, one of which was about where the President
was shot. He said that the map had nothing to do with the President’s
shooting and again, as he had one in the previous interviews, denied knowing
anything about the shooting of the President, or of the shooting of
Officer Tippit. He said the map had been used to locate buildings where
he had gone to talk to people about employment.</p>

<p>During this interview Inspector Kelley asked Oswald about his religious
views, and he replied that he didn’t agree with all the philosophies on
religion. He seemed evasive with Inspector Kelley about how he felt about
religion, and I asked him if he believed in a Diety. He was evasive and
didn’t answer this question.</p>

<p>Someone of the Federal officers asked Oswald if he thought Cuba
would be better off since the President was assassinated. To this he replied
that he felt that since the President was killed that someone else would
take his place, perhaps Vice-President Johnson, and that his views would
probably be largely the same as those of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>I again asked him about the gun and about the picture of him
holding a similar rifle, and at that time he again positively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_610">610</span>
denied having any knowledge of the picture or the rifle and
denied that he had ever lived on Neely Street, and when I told
him that friends who had visited him there said that he had
lived there, he said that they were mistaken about visiting
him there, because he had never lived there.</p>

<p>During this interview, Oswald said he was a Marxist. He
repeated two or three times, “I am a Marxist, but not a Leninist-Marxist.”
He told me that the station that he had debated on in
New Orleans was the one who carried Bill Stakey’s program. He
denied again knowing Alex Hidell in New Orleans, and again reiterated
his belief in Fair Play for Cuba and what the committee
stood for.</p>

<p>After some questioning, Chief Jesse E. Curry came to the
office and asked me if I was ready for the man to be transferred.
I told him we were ready as soon as the security was completed in
the basement, where we were to place Oswald in a car to transfer
him to the County Jail. I had objected to the cameras obstructing
the jail door, and the Chief explained to me that these have been
moved, and the people were moved back, and the cameramen were well
back in the garage. I told the Chief then that we were ready to
go. He told us to go ahead with the prisoner, and that he and
Chief Stevenson, who was with him, would meet us at the County Jail.</p>

<p>Oswald’s shirt, which he was wearing at the time of arrest,
had been removed and sent to the crime lab in Washington with all
the other evidence for a comparison test. Oswald said he would
like to have a shirt from his clothing that had been brought to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_611">611</span>
office to wear over the T-short that he was wearing at the time. We
selected the best-looking shirt from his things, but he said he would
prefer wearing a black Ivy League type shirt, indicating that it might
be a little warmer. We made this change and I asked him if he wouldn’t
like to wear a hat to more or less camouflage his looks in the car
while being transferred as all of the people who had been viewing
him had seen him bareheaded. He didn’t want to do this. Then
Officer J. R. Leavalle handcuffed his left hand to Oswald’s right
hand, then we left the office for the transfer.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as this report was made from rough notes and memory,
it is entirely possible that one of these questions could be in a
separate interview from the one indicated in this report. He was
interviewed under the most adverse conditions in my office which is
9 feet 6 inches by 14 feet, and has only one front door, which forced
us to move this prisoner through hundreds of people each time he was
carried from my office to the jail door, some 20 feet, during each
of these transfers. The crowd would attempt to jam around him,
shouting questions and many containing slurs. This office is also
surrounded by large glass windows, and there were many officers
working next to these windows. I have no records in this office
and was unable to record the interview. I was interrupted many
times during these interviews to step from the office to talk to
another witness or secure additional information from officers
needed for the interrogation.</p>

INVESTIGATION</h3>

<p class="p2 in0"><span class="small">FD-302 (Rev 3-3-59)</span></p>
<p class="center sans up1">FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="sans smaller">Date</span> 11/23/63</p>

<p class="p2 ti6">LEE HARVEY OSWALD, 1026 North Beckley, Dallas,
Texas, was interviewed by Captain WILL FRITZ of the
Homicide Bureau, Dallas Police Department. Special
Agents JAMES P. HOSTY, JR. and JAMES W. BOOKHOUT were
present during this interview. When the Agents entered
the interview room at 3:15 p.m., Captain FRITZ had been
previously interviewing LEE HARVEY OSWALD for an undetermined
period of time. Both Agents identified themselves to
OSWALD and advised him they were law enforcement officers
and anything he said could be used against him. OSWALD
at this time adopted a violent attitude toward the FBI
and both Agents and made many uncomplimentary remarks
about the FBI. OSWALD requested that Captain FRITZ remove
the cuffs from him, it being noted that OSWALD was handcuffed
with his hands behind him. Captain FRITZ had one
of his detectives remove the handcuffs and handcuff
OSWALD with his hands in front of him.</p>

<p class="ti6">Captain FRITZ asked OSWALD if he ever owned a rifle
and OSWALD stated that he had observed a MR. TRUELY (phonetic),
a supervisor at the Texas Schoolbook Depository on November
20, 1963, display a rifle to some individuals in his office
on the first floor of the Texas Schoolbook Depository, but
denied ever owning a rifle himself. OSWALD stated that he
had never been in Mexico except to Tijuana on one occasion.
However, he admitted to Captain FRITZ to having resided in
the Soviet Union for three years where he has many friends
and relatives of his wife.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD also admitted that he was the secretary
for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans,
Louisiana a few months ago. OSWALD stated that the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee has its headquarters in New York
City. OSWALD admitted to having received an award for
marksmanship while a member of the U.S. Marine Corps. He
further admitted that he was living at 1026 N. Beckley in
Dallas, Texas, under the name of O. H. LEE. OSWALD admitted
that he was present in the Texas Schoolbook Depository on
November 22, 1963, where he has been employed since October 15,
1963. OSWALD stated that as a laborer, he has access to
the entire building which has offices on the first and second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">613</span>
floors and storage on the third and fourth, as well as the
fifth and sixth floors. OSWALD stated that he went to
lunch at approximately noon and he claimed he ate his lunch
on the first floor in the lunchroom; however he went to the
second floor where the Coca-Cola machine was located and
obtained a bottle of Coca-Cola for his lunch. OSWALD claimed
to be on the first floor when President JOHN F. KENNEDY
passed this building.</p>

<p class="ti6">After hearing what had happened, he said that
because of all the confusion there would be no work performed
that afternoon so he decided to go home. OSWALD
stated he then went home by bus and changed his clothes
and went to a movie. OSWALD admitted to carrying a pistol
with him to this movie stating he did this because he
felt like it, giving no other reason. OSWALD further
admitted attempting to fight the Dallas police officers
who arrested him in this movie theater when he received a
cut and a bump.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD frantically denied shooting Dallas police
officer TIPPETT or shooting President JOHN F. KENNEDY. The
interview was concluded at 4:05 p.m. when OSWALD was removed
for a lineup.</p>

<p class="ti6">LEE HARVEY OSWALD, interviewed in offices of the
Dallas Police Department, was advised that he did not have to
make any statement, any statement he made could be used against
him in court and of his right to an attorney. He was requested
to furnish descriptive and biographical data concerning himself.</p>

<p class="ti6">The following was obtained from his responses and
examination of contents of his wallet:</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD declined to explain his possession of a photograph
of a Selective Service card in the name of “ALEK JAMES
HIDELL”.</p>

<p class="ti6">When interview had been substantially completed and
OSWALD was asked as to his present employment, he stated he
thought perhaps interview to obtain descriptive information was
too prolonged, that he had declined to be interviewed by any
other officers previously, and did not desire to be interviewed
by this agent. He remarked “I know your tactics—there is a
similar agency in Russia. You are using the soft touch and, of
course, the procedure in Russia would be quite different.”</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD was advised questions were intended to obtain
his complete physical description and background. Upon repetition
of the question as to his present employment, he furnished
same without further discussion.</p>

<p class="center sans up1">FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="sans smaller">Date</span> 11/25/63</p>

<p class="ti6">LEE HARVEY OSWALD was interviewed at the Homicide
and Robbery Bureau, Dallas Police Department, by Captain
J. W. FRITZ in the presence of Special Agent JAMES W. BOOKHOUT,
Federal Bureau of Investigation. OSWALD was advised of the
identity and official capacity of said agent and the fact
that he did not have to make any statement, that any statement
he did make could be used in a court of law against
him, and that any statement made must be free and voluntary
and that he had the right to consult with an attorney.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that he did not own any rifle. He advised
that he saw a rifle day before yesterday at the Texas School
Book Depository which MR. TRULY and two other gentlemen had
in their possession and were looking at.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that on November 22, 1963, at the
time of the search of the Texas School Book Depository
building by Dallas police officers, he was on the second
floor of said building, having just purchased a Coca-cola
from the soft-drink machine, at which time a police
officer came into the room with pistol drawn and asked him
if he worked there. MR. TRULY was present and verified that
he was an employee and the police officer thereafter left
the room and continued through the building. OSWALD
stated that he took this Coke down to the first floor and
stood around and had lunch in the employees lunch room.
He thereafter went outside and stood around for five or
ten minutes with foreman BILL SHELLY, and thereafter went
home. He stated that he left work because, in his opinion,
based upon remarks of BILL SHELLY, he did not believe that
there was going to be any more work that day due to the
confusion in the building. He stated after arriving at his
residence, then he went to a movie, where he was subsequently
apprehended by the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that his hours of work at the Texas
School Book Depository are from 8 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., but
that he is not required to punch a time clock. His usual
place of work in the building is on the first floor; however,
he frequently is required to go to the fourth, fifth, sixth,
and seventh floors of the building in order to get books and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">620</span>
this was true on November 22, 1963, and he had been on
all of the floors in the performance of his duties on
November 22, 1963.</p>

<p class="ti6">LEE HARVEY OSWALD was interviewed by Captain
J. W. FRITZ, Homicide and Robbery Bureau, Dallas Police
Department. OSWALD was advised of the identity of SA
JAMES W. BOOKHOUT, and his capacity as a Special Agent
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was informed
of his right to an attorney, that any statement he might
make could be used against him in a court of law, and
that any statement which he might make must be free and
voluntary. He furnished the following information in
the presence of T. J. TULLY, U.S. Secret Service; DAVID
B. GRANT, Secret Service; ROBERT I. NASH, United States
Marshall; and Detectives BILLY L. SENKEL and FAY M.
TURNER of the Homicide and Robbery Bureau, Dallas
Police Department.</p>

<p class="ti6">Following his departure from the Texas School
Book Depository, he boarded a city bus to his residence
and obtained transfer upon departure from the bus. He
stated that officers at the time of arresting him took
his transfer out of his pocket.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD advised that he had only one post office
box which was at Dallas, Texas. He denied bringing any
package to work on the morning of November 22, 1963. He
stated that he was not in the process of fixing up his
apartment and he denied telling WESLEY FRAZIER that the
purpose of his visit to Irving, Texas, on the night of
November 21, 1963, was to obtain some curtain rods from
MRS. RUTH PAINE.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that it was not exactly true
as recently stated by him that he rode a bus from his
place of employment to his residence on November 22, 1963.
He stated actually he did board a city bus at his place
of employment but that after about a block or two, due to
traffic congestion, he left the bus and rode a city cab to
his apartment on North Beckley. He recalled that at the time
of getting into the cab, some lady looked in and asked the
driver to call her a cab. He stated that he might have
made some remarks to the cab driver merely for the purpose
of passing the time of day at that time. He recalled that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">622</span>
his fare was approximately 85 cents. He stated that
after arriving at his apartment, he changed his shirt and
trousers because they were dirty. He described his dirty
clothes as being a reddish colored, long sleeved, shirt
with a button-down collar and gray colored trousers. He
indicated that he had placed these articles of clothing
in the lower drawer of his dresser.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that on November 22, 1963, he had eaten
lunch in the lunch room at the Texas School Book Depository,
alone, but recalled possibly two Negro employees walking
through the room during this period. He stated possibly
one of these employees was called “Junior” and the other
was a short individual whose name he could not recall but
whom he would be able to recognize. He stated that his
lunch had consisted of a cheese sandwich and an apple which
he had obtained at MRS. RUTH PAINE’s residence in Irving,
Texas, upon his leaving for work that morning.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that MRS. PAINE receives no pay
for keeping his wife and children at her residence. He
stated that their presence in MRS. PAINE’s residence is
a good arrangement for her because of her language
interest, indicating that his wife speaks Russian and
MRS. PAINE is interested in the Russian language.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD denied having kept a rifle in MRS. PAINE’s
garage at Irving, Texas, but stated that he did have certain
articles stored in her garage, consisting of two sea bags,
a couple of suitcases, and several boxes of kitchen articles
and also kept his clothes at MRS. PAINE’s residence. He stated
that all of the articles in MRS. PAINE’s garage had been
brought there about September, 1963, from New Orleans,
Louisiana.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that he has had no visitors at his
apartment on North Beckley.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that he has no receipts for purchase
of any guns and has never ordered any guns and does not own
a rifle nor has he ever possessed a rifle.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD denied that he is a member of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that he purchased a pistol, which
was taken off him by police officers November 22, 1963, about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">623</span>
six months ago. He declined to state where he had purchased
it.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that he arrived about July, 1962,
from USSR and was interviewed by the FBI at Fort Worth,
Texas. He stated that he felt they overstepped their
bounds and had used various tactics in interviewing him.</p>

<p class="ti6">He further complained that on interview of RUTH PAINE
by the FBI regarding his wife, that he felt that his
wife was intimidated.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that he desired to contact Attorney
ABT, New York City, indicating that ABT was the attorney
who had defended the Smith Act case about 1949-1950. He
stated that he does not know Attorney ABT personally.
Captain FRITZ advised OSWALD that arrangements would be
immediately made whereby he could call Attorney ABT.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that prior to coming to Dallas
from New Orleans he had resided at a furnished apartment
at 4706 Magazine Street, New Orleans, Louisiana. While
in New Orleans, he had been employed by WILLIAM B. RILEY
Company, 640 Magazine Street, New Orleans.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that he has nothing against
President JOHN F. KENNEDY personally; however in view
of the present charges against him, he did not desire to
discuss this phase further.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that he would not agree to take
a polygraph examination without the advice of counsel.
He added that in the past he has refused to take polygraph
examinations.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that he is a member of the American
Civil Liberties Union and added that MRS. RUTH PAINE was
also a member of same.</p>

<p class="ti6">With regard to Selective Service card in the
possession of OSWALD bearing photograph of OSWALD and
the name of ALEK JAMES HIDELL, OSWALD admitted that he
carried this Selective Service card but declined to state
that he wrote the signature of ALEK J. HIDELL appearing
on same. He further declined to state the purpose of
carrying same or any use he has made of same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">624</span></p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD stated that an address book in his possession
contains the names of various Russian immigrants residing in
Dallas, Texas, whom he has visited with.</p>

<p class="ti6">OSWALD denied shooting President JOHN F. KENNEDY

<p>LEE HARVEY OSWALD was interviewed at the Homicide
and Robbery Bureau, Dallas Police Department, at 6:35 p.m.,
by Captain J. W. FRITZ in the presence of Special Agent
JAMES W. BOOKHOUT, Federal Bureau of Investigation. OSWALD
was advised of the identity and official capacity of said
Agent and the fact that he did not have to make any statement,
that any statement he did make could be used in a
court of law against him, and that any statement made must
be free and voluntary and that he had the right to consult
with an attorney.</p>

<p>Captain J. W. FRITZ exhibited to LEE HARVEY
OSWALD a photograph which had been obtained by the Dallas
Police Department in a search, by starch warrant, of the
garage at the residence of MRS. RUTH PAINE, located at
Irving, Texas, which photograph reflects OSWALD holding a
rifle and wearing a holstered pistol. OSWALD was asked
if this was a photograph of himself. OSWALD stated that
he would not discuss the photograph without advice of
an attorney. He stated that the head of the individual
in the photograph could be his but that it was entirely
possible that the Police Department had superimposed
this part of the photograph over the body of someone
else. He pointed out that numerous news media had
snapped his photograph during the day and the possibility
existed that the police had doctored up this photograph.</p>

<p>OSWALD denied that he had purchased any rifle
from Kleins Store in Chicago, Illinois.</p>

<p>OSWALD complained of a lineup wherein he had not
been granted a request to put on a jacket similar to those
worn by some of the other individuals in the lineup.</p>

<h3>REPORTS OF INSPECTOR THOMAS J. KELLEY,
U.S. SECRET SERVICE</h3>

<p class="p1 center">FIRST INTERVIEW OF<br />
LEE HARVEY OSWALD</p>

<p class="p2">At about 10:30 A.M., November 23, 1963, I attended my first interview
with Oswald. Present during the interview at the Homicide Division, Dallas
Police Department, were Special Agent Jim Bookhout, FBI; Captain Will Fritz,
Homicide Division, Dallas Police Department; U.S. Marshal Robert Nash;
SA David Grant and SAIC Sorrels; and Officers Boyd and Hall of Captain
Fritz’s detail. The interview was not recorded. Mr. Sorrels and my presence
was as observers, since Oswald was being held for murder and his custody and
interrogation at that time was the responsibility of the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>In response to questions by Captain Fritz, Oswald said that immediately
after having left the building where he worked, he went by bus to
the theater where he was arrested; that when he got on the bus he secured a
transfer and thereafter transferred to other buses to get to his destination.
He denied that he brought a package to work on that day and he denied that
he had ever had any conversation about curtain rods with the boy named Wesley
who drove him to his employment. Fritz asked him if he had ridden a taxi
that day and Oswald then changed his story and said that when he got on the
bus he found it was going too slow and after two blocks he got off the bus
and took a cab to his home; that he passed the time with the cab driver and
that the cab driver had told him that the President was shot. He paid a cab
fare of 85¢.</p>

<p>In response to questions, he stated that this was the first time he had
ever ridden in a cab since a bus was always available. He said he went home,
changed his trousers and shirt, put his shirt in a drawer. This was a red
shirt, and he put it with his dirty clothes. He described the shirt as
having a button down collar and of reddish color. The trousers were grey
colored.</p>

<p>He said he ate his lunch with the colored boys who worked with him.
He described one of them as “Junior”, a colored boy, and the other was a
little short negro boy. He said his lunch consisted of cheese, bread, fruit,
and apples, and was the only package he had with him when he went to work.</p>

<p>He stated that Mrs. Paine practices Russian by having his wife live with
her. He denied that he had ever owned a rifle. He said he does not know Mr.
Paine very well but that Paine usually comes by the place where his wife was
living with Mrs. Paine on Friday or Wednesday. He stated that Mr. Paine has
a car and Mrs. Paine has had two cars. He said in response to questions by
Captain Fritz that his effects were in Mrs. Paine’s garage and that they consisted
of two sea bags with some other packages containing his personal belongings
and that he had brought those back from New Orleans with him sometime
in September. He stated that his brother, Robert, lived at 7313 Davenport
Street, Fort Worth, and that the Paines were his closest friends in town.
He denied that he had ever joined the Communist party; that he never had a
Communist card. He did belong to the American Civil Liberties Union and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_627">627</span>
paid $5 a year dues. He stated that he had bought the pistol that was
found in his possession when he was arrested about seven months ago.
He refused to answer any questions concerning the pistol or a gun until
he talked to a lawyer.</p>

<p>Oswald stated that at various other times he had been thoroughly
interrogated by the FBI; that they had used all the usual interrogation
practices and all their standard operating procedure; that he was very
familiar with interrogation, and he had no intention of answering any
questions concerning any shooting; that he knew he did not have to answer
them and that he would not answer any questions until he had been given
counsel. He stated that the FBI had used their hard and soft approach to
him, they used the buddy system; that he was familiar with all types of
questioning and had no intention of making any statements. He said that
in the past three weeks when the FBI had talked to his wife, they were
abusive and impolite; that they had frightened his wife and he considered
their activities obnoxious. He stated that he wanted to contact a Mr. Abt,
a New York lawyer whom he did not know but who had defended the Smith Act
“victims” in 1949 or 1950 in connection with a conspiracy against the
Government; that Abt would understand what this case was all about and that
he would give him an excellent defense. He stated in returning a question
about his former addresses that he lived at 4907 Magazine Street in New
Orleans at one time and worked for the William Riley Company; that he was
arrested in New Orleans for disturbing the peace and paid a $10 fine while
he was demonstrating for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee; that he had a
fight with some anti-Castro refugees and that they were released while he
was fined.</p>

<p>Upon questioning by Captain Fritz, he said, “I have no views on the
President.” “My wife and I like the President’s family. They are interesting
people. I have my own views on the President’s national policy.
I have a right to express my views but because of the charges I do not
think I should comment further.” Oswald said, “I am not a malcontent;
nothing irritated me about the President.” He said that during 1962 he was
interviewed by the FBI and that he at that time refused to take a polygraph
and that he did not intend to take a polygraph test for the Dallas police.
At this time Captain Fritz showed a Selective Service Card that was taken out
of his wallet which bore the name of Alex Hidell. Oswald refused to discuss
this after being asked for an explanation of it, both by Fritz and by James
Bookhout, the FBI Agent. I asked him if he viewed the parade and he said he
had not. I then asked him if he had shot the President and he said he had not.
I asked him if he had shot Governor Connally and he said he had not. He did
not intend to answer further questions without counsel and that if he could not
get Abt, then he would hope that the Civil Liberties Union would give him an
attorney to represent him. At that point Captain Fritz terminated the interview
at about 11:30 A.M., 11-23-63.</p>

<p class="newpage p2 center">INTERVIEWS WITH LEE HARVEY OSWALD
ON NOVEMBER 23, 1963</p>

<p>At about 12:35 P.M., November 23, 1963, Lee Oswald was interviewed in
the offices of Captain Will Fritz of the Homicide Division, Dallas Police Department.
Among those present at this interview were Inspector Kelley,
Captain Fritz, Detectives Senkel and Tiernon of the Homicide Division and
SA James Bookout, FBI. Captain Fritz conducted the interview which was
concerned mostly with Oswald’s place of residence in Dallas and was an
attempt to ascertain where the bulk of Oswald’s belongings were located in
Dallas. As a result of the interview, Oswald furnished information to
Captain Fritz that most of his personal effects, including a sea bag, were
in the garage at the address of Mrs. Paine, 2515 West 5th Street, Irving,
Texas.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The interview was concluded about 1:10 P.M. and immediately
thereafter members of the Homicide Division secured a search
warrant and recovered Oswald’s effects from the home of Mrs.
Paine. Found among the effects were two different poses in
snapshot type photographs taken of Oswald holding a rifle in
one hand and holding up a copy of a paper called the <cite>Militant</cite>
and “The Worker” in the other hand. Oswald was wearing a
revolver in a holster on his right side. This photograph was
enlarged by the Dallas Police Laboratories and was used as a
basis of additional questioning of Oswald at approximately
6:00 P.M. that same evening.</p></blockquote>

<p>On November 23, 1963, at 6:00 P.M., in the office of Captain Fritz,
Homicide Division, Dallas Police Department, I was present at an interview
with Oswald. Also present were Captain Fritz, FBI Agent Jim Bookhoutt, and
four officers from the Homicide Division. This interview was conducted with
Oswald for the purpose of displaying to him the blow-ups of photographs showing
him holding a rifle and a pistol which were seized as a result of the
search warrant for the garage of Mrs. Paine at 2515 West 5th Street, Irving,
Texas. When the photographs were presented to Oswald, he sneered at them
saying that they were fake photographs; that he had been photographed a
number of times the day before by the police and apparently after they
photographed him they superimposed on the photographs a rifle and put a gun
in his pocket. He got into a long argument with Captain Fritz about his
knowledge of photography and asked Fritz a number of times whether the
smaller photograph was made from the larger or whether the larger photograph
was made from the smaller. He said at the proper time he would show that the
photographs were fakes. Fritz told him that the smaller photograph was taken
from his effects at the garage. Oswald became arrogant and refused to answer
any further questions concerning the photographs and would not identify the
photographs as being a photograph of himself. Captain Fritz displayed great
patience and tenacity in attempting to secure from Oswald the location of what
apparently is the backyard of an address at which Oswald formerly lived, but
it was apparent that Oswald, though slightly shaken by the evidence, had no
intention of furnishing any information.</p>

<p>The interview was terminated at about 7:15 P.M.</p>

Covers third interview with Oswald and<br />
circumstances immediately following his murder</p>

<p class="p2 in0">This interview started at approximately 9:30 AM on Sunday, November 24, 1963.
The interview was conducted in the office of Captain Will Fritz of the Homicide
Bureau, Dallas Police. Present at the interview in addition to Oswald were
Captain Fritz, Postal Inspector Holmes, SAIC Sorrels, Inspector Kelley and four
members of the Homicide Squad. The interview had just begun when I arrived and
Captain Fritz was again requesting Oswald to identify the place where the photograph
of him holding the gun was taken. Captain Fritz indicated that it would
save the Police a great deal of time if he would tell them where the place was
located. Oswald refused to discuss the matter. Captain Fritz asked, “Are you
a Communist?” Oswald answered, “No, I am a Marxist but I am not a Marxist
Leninist”. Captain Fritz asked him what the difference was and Oswald said it
would take too long to explain it to him. Oswald said that he became interested
in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee while he was in New Orleans; that he wrote
to the Committee’s Headquarters in New York and received some Committee literature
and a letter signed by Alex Hidell. He stated that he began to distribute
that literature in New Orleans and it was at that time that he got into an
altercation with a group and he was arrested. He said his opinions concerning
Fair Play for Cuba are well known; that he appeared on Bill Stukey’s television
program in New Orleans on a number of occasions and was interviewed by the local
press often. He denies knowing or ever seeing Hidell in New Orleans, said he
believed in all of the tenets of the Fair Play for Cuba and the things which the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee stood for which was free intercourse with Cuba and
freedom for tourists of the both countries to travel within each other’s borders.</p>

<p class="in0">Among other things, Oswald said that Cuba should have <span class="strike">folded</span> full diplomatic relationship
with the United States. I asked him if he thought that the President’s
assassination would have any effect on the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He said
there would be no change in the attitude of the American people toward Cuba with
President Johnson becoming President because they both belonged to the same
political party and the one would follow pretty generally the policies of the
other. He stated that he is an avid reader of Russian literature whether it is
communistic or not; that he subscribes to “The Militant”, which, he says, is the
weekly of the Socialist party in the United States (it is a copy of “The Militant”
that Oswald is shown holding in the photograph taken from his effects at Irving
Street). At that time he asked me whether I was an FBI Agent and I said that I
was not that I was a member of the Secret Service. He said when he was standing
in front of the Textbook Building and about to leave it, a young crew-cut man
rushed up to him and said he was from the Secret Service, showed a book of
identification, and asked him where the phone was. Oswald said he pointed toward
the pay phone in the building and that he saw the man actually go to the phone
before he left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_630">630</span>
I asked Oswald whether as a Marxist he believed that religion was an opiate
of the people and he said very definitely so that all organized religions tend
to become monopolistic and are the causes of a great deal of class warfare. I
asked him whether he considered the Catholic Church to be an enemy of the
Communist philosophy and he said well, there was no Catholicism in Russia;
that the closest to it is the Orthodox Churches but he said he would not further
discuss his opinions of religion since this was an attempt to have him say something
which could be construed as being anti-religious or anti Catholic.</p>

<p class="in0">Capt. Fritz displayed an Enco street map of Dallas which had been found among
Oswald’s effects at the rooming house. Oswald was asked whether the map was his
and whether he had put some marks on it. He said it was his and remarked “My
God don’t tell me there’s a mark near where this thing happened”. The mark was
pointed out to him and he said “What about the other marks on the map?—I put a
number of marks on it. I was looking for work and marked the places where I went
for jobs or where I heard there were jobs”.</p>

<p class="in0">Since it was obvious to Captain Fritz that Oswald was not going to be cooperative,
he terminated the interview at that time.</p>

<p class="in0">I approached Oswald then and, out of the hearing of the others except perhaps one
of Captain Fritz’s men, said that as a Secret Service agent, we are anxious to
talk with him as soon as he had secured counsel; that we were responsible for the
safety of the President; that the Dallas Police had charged him with the assassination
of the President but that he had denied it; we were therefore very anxious
to talk with him to make certain that the correct story was developing as it
related to the assassination. He said that he would be glad to discuss this
proposition with his attorney and that after he talked to one, we could either
discuss it with him or discuss it with his attorney, if the attorney thought it
was the wise thing to do, but that at the present time he had nothing more to say
to me. Oswald was then handed some different clothing to put on. The clothing
included a sweater. Captain Fritz made a number of telephone calls to ascertain
whether the preparations he had placed into effect for transferring the prisoner
to the County Jail were ready and upon being so advised, Captain Fritz and members
of the Detective Bureau escorted Oswald from the Homicide Office on the third
floor to the basement where Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby.</p>

<p class="in0">On the completion of the interview, SAIC Sorrels and I proceeded to the office of
the Chief of Police on the third floor and were discussing the interview when we
heard that Oswald had been shot. We both ran down the steps to the basement. I
arrived in the ante-room where they had dragged Oswald. SAIC Sorrels located and
interviewed Ruby. Someone was bending over Oswald with a stethoscope and he
appeared to be unconscious in very serious condition at that time. I asked Captain
Fritz what had happened and he said Oswald had been shot by one Jack “Rubio” whom
the police knew as a tavern operator. Shortly thereafter a stretcher arrived and
I accompanied the stretcher to the ambulance which had been hastily backed into the
garage. I observed that during the transfer that Oswald was unconscious; when the
ambulance drove away from the building, I attempted to board a cruiser that
apparently was going to follow the ambulance but I was unable to get into the car
before it pulled away. Special Agents Warner and Patterson had heard of the shooting
on their radio, proceeded to Parkland Hospital where Oswald was being taken and
arrived vary shortly after Oswald had arrived at the emergency entrance and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_631">631</span>
being taken into the emergency treatment room. One or the other of these agents
was in close proximity to Oswald while he was being treated. When I arrived at
the hospital, I rode up on the elevator with Dr. Shaw who had looked at Oswald
as he had come in and was being recalled to the operating room where Oswald had
been taken. While Oswald was in the operating room, no one other than medical
personnel was present but a Dallas policeman who had accompanied Oswald in the
ambulance was standing in the doorway of the operating room in operating room
scrub clothes. No other investigating personnel were in the vicinity. In the
immediate vicinity of the detective was Special Agent Warner. Oswald made no
statements from the time he was shot until the time of his death. He was unconscious
during the ambulance run to the hospital which I verified through
Detective Daugherty, who accompanied him. He did not regain consciousness at
any time during the treatment until he died. At the time of his death, myself,
Detective Daugherty and Colonel Garrison of the Texas State Police were on the
fifth floor of the hospital arranging a security room in which to take Oswald,
in the event he survived the operating room treatment. It was never necessary
to use this room and upon learning of his death, I proceeded to the morgue to
arrange for his family to view the body. When the family heard of the death
they were in the process of being interviewed by Special Agents Kunkel and Howard,
and requested to be brought to the hospital. Oswald’s brother, Robert, who had
also come to the hospital, was being interviewed by Special Agent Howlett. Before
the post mortem was performed, Oswald’s family, with the exception of Robert,
viewed the body. Robert arrived too late to view the body before the autopsy
had started and was not permitted by hospital authorities to view the body. The
family was accompanied during the viewing by the hospital chaplain.</p>

<p class="in0">After making arrangements through the chaplain and another clergyman for the
burial of the body, the family was returned to a secluded spot under the protection
of Special Agents Kunkel and Howard, and the Irving Texas police. Precaution
was taken to insure their safety in view of the excitement caused by the killing
of Oswald. Special Agents Howard and Kunkel did an excellent job in handling the
security of this family detail and insuring their safety. Thereafter, I was
called by SAIC Bouck who advised me that the President and the Attorney General
were concerned about the safety of this family and instructed that all precautions
should be taken to insure that no harm befell them. SAIC Bouck was advised that
the family was presently under our protection; we would continue providing
protection until further notice.</p>

<p class="in0">Later that same day, I was contacted by SA Robertson of the FBI who asked whether
we had someone with the family. He was assured that we had. He requested to be
advised where the family had been taken. Since their ultimate destination was
unknown to me at the time, I assured him that when I learned of their whereabouts
I would relay it to him. He said that they received instructions from the Attorney
General and President Johnson that precaution should be taken to insure the family
safety.</p>

<p class="in0">At 11 pm, Sunday, November 24th, I was advised of the location of the family and
immediately notified Robertson and inquired whether they now wished to take over
their protection. He said no they had no such instructions, they merely wished to
be assured that someone was looking out for their safety. I assured them that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_632">632</span>
adequate protection was being provided and that they were available for interviews
by the FBI. He stated that they did not wish to interview the family
at this time; that they merely wanted to make sure they were in safe hands.</p>

<h3 class="newpage">REPORT OF U.S. POSTAL INSPECTOR H. D. HOLMES</h3>

<p class="p1 in0">Dallas, Texas</p>
<p class="up1 sigright">December 17, 1963</p>

<p class="p2 center"><i>MEMORANDUM OF INTERVIEW</i></p>

<p class="p2 in0">Informal memorandum furnished by Postal Inspector H. D. Holmes, Dallas, Texas,
of an interview he took part in with Lee H. Oswald on Sunday morning, November
24, 1963, between the approximate hours of 9:25 a.m. to 11:10 a.m. Those
present, in addition to Inspector Holmes, were Captain Will Fritz, Dallas
Police, Forrest V. Sorrels, Local Agent in Charge, Secret Service, and Thomas
J. Kelly, Inspector, Secret Service. In addition, there were three Detectives
who were apparently assigned to guarding Oswald as none of them took part in
the interrogation.</p>

<p class="in0">Oswald at no time appeared confused or in doubt as to whether or not he should
answer a question. On the contrary, he was quite alert and showed no hesitancy
in answering those questions which he wanted to answer, and was quite skillful
in parrying those questions which he did not want to answer. I got the impression
that he had disciplined his mind and reflexes to a state where I personally
doubted if he would ever have confessed. He denied, emphatically, having taken
part in or having had any knowledge of the shooting of the policeman Tippitt or
of the President, stating that so far as he is concerned the reason he was in
custody was because he “popped a policeman in the nose in a theater on Jefferson
Avenue.”</p>

<p class="in0">P. O. BOXES—He was questioned separately about the three boxes he had
rented, and in each instance his answers were quick, direct and accurate as
reflected on the box rental applications. He stated without prompting that
he had rented Box 2915 at the Main Post Office for several months prior to
his going to New Orleans, that this box was rented in his own name, Lee H.
Oswald, and that he had taken out two keys to the box, and that when he had
closed the box, he directed that his mail be forwarded to him at his street
address in New Orleans.</p>

<p class="in0">He stated that no one received mail in this box other than himself, nor did
he receive any mail under any other name than his own true name; that no one
had access to the box other than himself nor did he permit anyone else to use
this box. He stated it was possible that on rare occasions he may have handed
one of the keys to his wife to go get his mail but certainly nobody else. He
denied emphatically that he ever ordered a rifle under his name or any other
name, nor permitted anyone else to order a rifle to be received in this box.
Further, he denied that he had ever ordered any rifle by mail order or bought any
money order for the purpose of paying for such a rifle. In fact, he claimed he
owned no rifle and had not practiced or shot a rifle other than possibly a .22,
small bore rifle, since his days with the Marine Corp. He stated that “How
could I afford to order a rifle on my salary of $1.25 an hour when I can’t
hardly feed myself on what I make.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_634">634</span></p>

<p class="in0">When asked if he had a post office box in New Orleans he stated that he did,
for the reason that he subscribed to several publications, at least two of
which were published in Russia, one being the hometown paper published in
Minsk where he met and married his wife, and that he moved around so much
that it was more practical to simply rent post office boxes and have his
mail forwarded from one box to the next rather than going through the process
of furnishing changes of address to the publishers. When asked if he permitted
anyone other than himself to get mail in box 30061 at New Orleans, he stated
that he did not. It will be recalled that on this box rent application he
showed that both Marina Oswald and A. J. Hidell were listed under the caption
“Persons entitled to receive mail through box”. After denying that anyone else
was permitted to get mail in the box, he was reminded that this application
showed the name Marina Oswald as being entitled to receive mail in the box
and he replied “well so what, she was my wife and I see nothing wrong with
that, and it could very well be that I did place her name on the application”.
He was then reminded that the application also showed the name A. J. Hidell
was also entitled to receive mail in the box, at which he simply shrugged his
shoulders and stated “I don’t recall anything about that”.</p>

<p class="in0">He stated that when he came back to Dallas and after he had gone to work for
the Texas School Book Depository, he had rented a box at the nearby Terminal
Annex postal station, this being Box 6225, and that this box was also rented
in his name, Lee H. Oswald. He stated he had only checked out one key for
this box, which information was found to be accurate, and this key was found
on his person at the time of his arrest. He professed not to recall the fact
that he showed on the box rental application under name of corporation “Fair
Play For Cuba Committee” and “American Civil Liberties Union”. When asked as
to why he showed these organizations on the application, he simply shrugged
and said that he didn’t recall showing them. When asked if he paid the box
rental fee or did the organizations pay it, he stated that he paid it. In
answer to another question, he also stated that no one had any knowledge that
he had this box other than himself.</p>

<p class="in0">ORGANIZATIONS- MEMBERSHIP IN—With respect to American Civil Liberties Union
he was a little evasive stating something to the effect that he had made some
effort to join but it was never made clear whether he had or had not been
accepted. He stated that he first became interested in the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee, after he went to New Orleans, that it started out as being a group
of individuals who, like him, who thought and had like political opinions.
They did decide to organize, and did organize after a fashion, but denied that
they had any president or any elected officers. He stated that he, himself,
could probably be considered the secretary since he wrote some letters on their
behalf and attempted to collect dues which, if I recall, were $1.00 per month.
He also stated that there was a “Fair Play for Cuba Committee” in New York which
was better organized. He denied that he was sent to Dallas for the purpose of
organizing such a cell in Dallas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_635">635</span></p>

<p class="in0">When asked if he was a communist, he stated emphatically not, that he was a
Marxist. Someone asked the difference and he stated that a communist is a
Lenin-Marxist, that he himself was a pure Marxist, and when someone asked
the difference, he stated that it was a long story and if they didn’t know,
it would take too long to tell them. He stated further that he had read about
everything written by or about Karl Marx.</p>

<p class="in0">When asked as to his religion, he stated that Karl Marx was his religion, and
in response to further questioning he stated that some people may find the
Bible interesting reading, but it was not for him, stating further that even
as a philosophy there was not much to the Bible.</p>

<p class="in0">MARINE CORP SERVICE—Captain Fritz made some mention of his dishonorable
discharge from the Marine Corp at which point he bristled noticeably, stating
that he had been discharged with an “honorable” discharge and that this was
later changed due to his having attempted to denounce his American Citizenship
while he was living in Russia. He stated further that since his change of
citizenship did not come to pass, he had written a letter to Mr. Connally,
then Secretary of the Navy, and after considerable delay, received a very
respectful reply wherein Connally stated he had resigned to run for Governor
of Texas, and that his letter was being referred to the new Secretary, a Mr.
Cork, Kurth, or something like that. He showed no particular animosity toward
Mr. Connally while discussing this feature.</p>

<p class="in0">MAP—Captain Fritz advised him that among his effects in his room, there was
found a map of the City of Dallas that had some marks on it and asked him to
explain this map. Oswald said he presumed he had reference to an old City map
which he had on which he had made some X’s denoting location of firms that had
advertised job vacancies. He stated that he had no transportation and either
walked or rode a bus and that as he was constantly looking for work, in fact
had registered for employment at the Texas Employment Bureau, and that as he
would receive leads either from newspaper ads or from the Bureau or from
neighbors, he would chart these places on the map to save time in his traveling.
He said to the best of his recollection, most of them were out Industrial,
presumably meaning Industrial Blvd. When asked as to why the X at the location
of the Texas School Book Depository at Elm and Houston, he stated that “Well,
I interviewed there for a job, in fact, got the job, therefore the X”.</p>

<p class="in0">When asked as to how he learned about this vacancy, he stated that “Oh, it was
general information in the neighborhood, I don’t recall just who told me about
it, but I learned it from people in Mrs. Paynes’ neighborhood” and that all the
people around there were looking out for possible employment for him.</p>

<p class="in0">ACTIVITY JUST PRIOR TO AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT—To an
inquiry as to why he went to visit his wife on Thursday night, November 21,
whereas he normally visited her over the weekend, he stated that on this
particular weekend he had learned that his wife and Mrs. Payne were giving a
party for the children and that they were having in a “houseful” of neighborhood
children and that he just didn’t want to be around at such a time. Therefore,
he made his weekly visit on Thursday night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_636">636</span></p>

<p class="in0">When asked if he didn’t bring a sack with him the next morning to work, he
stated that he did, and when asked as to the contents of the sack, he stated
that it contained his lunch. Then, when asked as to the size or shape of the
sack, he said “Oh, I don’t recall, it may have a small sack or a large sack,
you don’t always find one that just fits your sandwiches.” When asked as to
where he placed the sack when he got in the car, he said in his lap, or possibly
the front seat beside him, as he always did because he didn’t want to get it
crushed. He denied that he placed any package in the back seat. When advised
that the driver stated that he had brought out a long parcel and placed it in
the back seat, he stated “Oh, he must be mistaken or else thinking about some
other time when he picked me up.”</p>

<p class="in0">When asked as to his whereabouts at the time of the shooting, he stated that
when lunch time came, and he didn’t say which floor he was on, he said one of
the Negro employees invited him to eat lunch with him and he stated “You go
on down and send the elevator back up and I will join you in a few minutes.”
Before he could finish whatever he was doing, he stated, the commotion
surrounding the assassination took place and when he went down stairs, a policeman
questioned him as to his identification and his boss stated that “he is one
of our employees” whereupon the policeman had him step aside momentarily.
Following this, he simply walked out the front door of the building. I don’t
recall that anyone asked why he left or where or how he went. I just presumed
that this had been covered in an earlier questioning.</p>

<p class="in0">A. J. HIDELL IDENTIFICATION CARD—Captain Fritz asked him if he knew anyone
by the name of A. J. Hidell and he denied that he did. When asked if he had
ever used this name as an alias, he also made a denial. In fact, he stated
that he had never used the name, didn’t know anyone by this name, and never
had heard of the name before. Captain Fritz then asked him about the I.D.
card he had in his pocket bearing such a name and he flared up and stated
“I’ve told you all I’m going to about that card. You took notes, just read
them for yourself, if you want to refresh your memory.” He told Captain Fritz
that “You have the card. Now you know as much about it as I do.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p class="in0">About 11:00 a.m. or a few minutes thereafter, someone handed through the door
several hangers on which there were some trousers, shirts, and a couple of
sweaters. When asked if he wanted to change any of his clothes before being
transferred to the County jail, he said “Just give me one of these sweaters.”
He didn’t like the one they handed him and insisted on putting on a black
slip-over sweater than had some jagged holes in it near the front of the right
shoulder. One cuff was released while he slipped this over the head, following
which he was again cuffed. During this change of clothing, Chief of Police
Curry came into the room and discussed something in an inaudible undertone with
Captain Fritz, apparently for the purpose of not letting Oswald hear what was
being said. I have no idea what this conversation was, but just presume they
were discussing the transfer of the prisoner. I did not go downstairs to
witness the further transfer of the prisoner.</p>

<span class="subhead">Speculations and Rumors</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Myths have traditionally surrounded the dramatic assassinations
of history. The rumors and theories about the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln that are still being publicized were for the most
part first bruited within months of his death. Wherever there is any
element of mystery in such dramatic events misconceptions often result
from sensational speculations.</p>

<p>Lacking the testimony of Lee Harvey Oswald, it has been necessary
to reconstruct painstakingly all of the facts that led the Commission
to the conclusion that Oswald assassinated President Kennedy, acting
alone and without advice or assistance. The Commission has found
no credible evidence that he was a member of a foreign or domestic
conspiracy of any kind. Nor was there any evidence that he was
involved with any criminal or underworld elements or that he had
any association with his slayer, Jack Ruby, except as his victim. The
evidence on these issues has been set forth in great detail in this report.</p>

<p>In addition the Commission has inquired into the various hypotheses,
rumors, and speculations that have arisen from the tragic
developments of November 22-24, 1963. It is recognized that the
public judgment of these events has been influenced, at least to some
extent, by these conjectures.</p>

<p>Many questions have been raised about the facts out of genuine
puzzlement or because of misinformation which attended some of
the early reporting of the fast-crowding events of these 3 days. Most
of the speculation and attempted reconstruction of these events by the
public centered on these basic questions: Was Lee Harvey Oswald
really the assassin of the President; why did he do it; did he have any
accomplices; and why did Ruby shoot Oswald? Many of the theories
and hypotheses advanced have rested on premises which the Commission
feels deserve critical examination.</p>

<p>Many people who witnessed the assassination and the killing of
Oswald or were present in the area were a major source of diverse and
often contradictory information. As is easily understood under such
circumstances, all of the witnesses did not see and hear the same thing
or interpret what they saw and heard the same way and many changed
their stories as they repeated them. Moreover, they were interviewed
at different times after the event by different people and often under
circumstances which made accurate reporting extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Even the occupants of the cars in the Presidential motorcade were
not entirely in agreement in their accounts because they, too, saw
and heard what happened from different positions. Moreover, those
closest to the assassination were subjected to a physical and emotional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_638">638</span>
strain that tended to affect their recollections of what they thought
they saw or heard. Consequently, the presentation of the news from
Dallas included much misinformation. This, to some extent, was
unavoidable, but the widespread and repetitive dissemination of every
scrap of information about the President’s assassination and its aftermath
has helped to build up a large number of erroneous conclusions.
The manner in which local authorities released information about the
investigation, sometimes before it could be verified in all detail, has
further contributed to the fund of ill-founded theories. Typographical
mistakes in the press and failure to transcribe sound accurately
from tapes resulted in errors, some of which have remained uncorrected
in print at the time of the publication of this report.</p>

<p>Much of the speculation that has persisted in one form or another
since November 22-24 came from people who usually spoke in good
faith. Some of the errors have resulted simply from a lack of complete
knowledge at the time of the event. In this category are the statements
attributed to doctors at Parkland Memorial Hospital who attended
the dying President and described his wounds to the press
afterward. It remained for the autopsy in Washington, completed
early the next morning, to ascertain the full facts concerning the
wounds. The correction of earlier assertions of fact on the basis
of later and fuller analysis or investigation is a normal part of the
process of accumulation of evidence. But it is not often that the
process is conducted in such an intense glare of worldwide publicity,
and later corrections have difficulty overtaking the original sensational
reports.</p>

<p>There is still another category of speculation and rumor that complicated
and broadened the work of the Commission. Numerous
people claimed to have seen Oswald or Ruby at various times and
places in the United States or abroad. Others insisted that during
the days following the assassination, they had detected significant
actions on television that were witnessed by no one else. Still others
assumed from a widely published picture that Oswald was standing
on the steps of the entrance to the Texas School Book Depository at
the time the President was shot. Throughout the country people reported
overheard remarks, conversations, threats, prophesies, and
opinions that seemed to them to have a possible bearing on the assassination.
More than a few informants initially told their speculations
or professed firsthand information to newspaper and television
reporters. Later, many of them changed or retracted their stories in
telling them to official investigators.</p>

<p>The U.S. investigative agencies expended much valuable time and
effort inquiring into these leads. Investigations of a vast number of
rumors and speculations reached into almost every part of the United
States and to most of the other continents of the world.</p>

<p>The Commission’s work was also handicapped by those witnesses
and other persons connected with the investigation who sold for publication
evidence pertinent to the investigation. These persons sold
pictures and documents and even recollections, sometimes before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_639">639</span>
Commission had an opportunity to receive their evidence. Some of
the evidence thus published was changed from its original form and
gave misleading impressions to the public. The piecemeal release of
this evidence, sometimes in distorted or exaggerated form, and often
out of context, provided the basis for new speculations and rumors
or served to reinforce already current ones. The practice was frequently
harmful to the work of the Commission and a disservice to
the public.</p>

<p>This appendix is intended to clarify the most widespread factual
misunderstandings. False or inaccurate speculations concerning the
assassination and related events are set forth below together with
brief summary statements of what the Commission has found to be
the true facts. The citation following each Commission finding is
either to that portion of the report in which the subject is discussed
more fully, to the evidence in the record supporting the finding, or
to both. For complete answers to these speculations, the sources cited
in the footnotes should be consulted. The speculations are considered

<h3 id="hdr232">THE SOURCE OF THE SHOTS</h3>

<p>There have been speculations that some or all of the shots aimed
at President Kennedy and Governor Connally came from the railroad
overpass as the Presidential automobile approached it, or from somewhere
other than the Texas School Book Depository Building. Related
speculations maintain that the shots came from both the railroad
overpass and the Texas School Book Depository Building.
These are supported by a number of assertions that have been carefully
examined by the Commission in the course of its investigation and
rejected as being without foundation. They are set forth below, together
with the results of the Commission’s investigation.</p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The shots that killed the President came from the
railroad overpass above the triple underpass.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The shots that entered the neck and head of
the President and wounded Governor Connally came from behind and
above. There is no evidence that any shots were fired at the President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_640">640</span>
from anywhere other than the Texas School Book
Depository Building.<a id="FNanchor_A12-1" href="#Footnote_A12-1" class="fnanchor">A12-1</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The railroad overpass was left unguarded on
November 22.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—On November 22 the railroad overpass was
guarded by two Dallas policemen, Patrolmen J. W. Foster and J. C.
White, who have testified that they permitted only railroad personnel
on the overpass.<a id="FNanchor_A12-2" href="#Footnote_A12-2" class="fnanchor">A12-2</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—There are witnesses who alleged that the shots came
from the overpass.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Commission does not have knowledge
of any witnesses who saw shots fired from the overpass. Statements
or depositions from the 2 policemen and 13 railroad employees who
were on the overpass all affirm that no shots were fired from the overpass.
Most of these witnesses who discussed the source of the shots
stated that they came from the direction of Elm and Houston Streets.<a id="FNanchor_A12-3" href="#Footnote_A12-3" class="fnanchor">A12-3</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—A rifle cartridge was recovered on the overpass.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—No cartridge of any kind was found on the
overpass nor has any witness come forward to claim having found
one.<a id="FNanchor_A12-4" href="#Footnote_A12-4" class="fnanchor">A12-4</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—A witness to the assassination said that she saw a
man run behind the concrete wall of the overpass and disappear.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Mrs. Jean L. Hill stated that after the firing
stopped she saw a white man wearing a brown overcoat and a hat
running west away from the Depository Building in the direction of
the railroad tracks. There are no other witnesses who claim to have
seen a man running toward the railroad tracks. Examination of all
available films of the area following the shooting, reexamination of
interviews with individuals in the vicinity of the shooting, and interviews
with members of the Dallas Police Department and the Dallas
County sheriff’s office failed to corroborate Mrs. Hill’s recollection
or to reveal the identity of the man described by Mrs. Hill.<a id="FNanchor_A12-5" href="#Footnote_A12-5" class="fnanchor">A12-5</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Immediately after the shooting a motorcycle policeman
was seen racing up the grassy embankment to the right of the
shooting scene pursuing a couple seeking to flee from the overpass.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—There are no witnesses who have ever stated
this and there is no evidence to support the claim. A motorcycle
policeman, Clyde A. Haygood, dismounted in the street and ran up
the incline. He stated that he saw no one running from the railroad
yards adjacent to the overpass. Subsequently, at 12:37 p.m., Haygood
reported that the shots had come from the Texas School Book Depository
Building.<a id="FNanchor_A12-6" href="#Footnote_A12-6" class="fnanchor">A12-6</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—More than three shots, perhaps as many as five or
six, were fired at the President and Governor Connally.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The weight of the evidence indicates that
three shots were fired, of which two struck President Kennedy. There
is persuasive evidence from the experts that one of these two bullets
also struck Governor Connally. Some witnesses claimed that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_641">641</span>
heard more than three shots but, as fully described in chapter III, the
great majority heard only three shots.<a id="FNanchor_A12-7" href="#Footnote_A12-7" class="fnanchor">A12-7</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—At least four or five bullets have been found.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—After the assassination, metal remains of bullets
were recovered. These included an almost whole bullet of 158.6
grains, fragments weighing 44.6 grains and 21.0 grains, and other
fragments too small to be identified. These metal remains indicate that
at least two shots were fired. The Commission believes that three shots
were fired.<a id="FNanchor_A12-8" href="#Footnote_A12-8" class="fnanchor">A12-8</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—A bullet was found on the stretcher used for President
Kennedy at Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—No bullet was found on the stretcher used by
President Kennedy. An almost whole bullet was found when it
rolled off the stretcher used by Governor Connally.<a id="FNanchor_A12-9" href="#Footnote_A12-9" class="fnanchor">A12-9</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—A bullet was found in the grass near the scene of the
assassination shortly afterward by a deputy sheriff of Dallas County,
E. R. Walthers.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Walthers has denied that he found a bullet
at any time or that he told anyone that he had found one. With
another deputy sheriff he made a diligent search for such a bullet 2 or
3 days after the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_A12-10" href="#Footnote_A12-10" class="fnanchor">A12-10</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The Presidential car stopped momentarily or almost
came to a complete halt after the first shot. This is evidence that
the driver had the impression that the first shot came from the front
and therefore hesitated to drive closer to the overpass.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Presidential car did not stop or almost
come to a complete halt after the firing of the first shot or any other
shots. The driver, Special Agent William E. Greer, has testified that
he accelerated the car after what was probably the second shot.
Motion pictures of the scene show that the car slowed down momentarily
after the shot that struck the President in the head and then speeded
up rapidly.<a id="FNanchor_A12-11" href="#Footnote_A12-11" class="fnanchor">A12-11</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The Presidential car had a small round bullet hole
in the front windshield. This is evidence that a shot or shots were
fired at the President from the front of the car.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The windshield was not penetrated by any
bullet. A small residue of lead was found on the inside surface of
the windshield; on the outside of the windshield was a very small
pattern of cracks immediately in front of the lead residue on the inside.
The bullet from which this lead residue came was probably one of those
that struck the President and therefore came from overhead and to
the rear. Experts established that the abrasion in the windshield
came from impact on the inside of the glass.<a id="FNanchor_A12-12" href="#Footnote_A12-12" class="fnanchor">A12-12</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The throat wound sustained by the President was the
result of a shot fired from the front according to doctors at Parkland
Hospital.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Doctors at Parkland Hospital originally
believed that the throat wound could have been either an entry or exit
wound, but they made no examination to determine entry and exit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_642">642</span>
wounds. Subsequently, when the evidence of the autopsy became
available, the doctors at Parkland agreed that it was an exit wound.<a id="FNanchor_A12-13" href="#Footnote_A12-13" class="fnanchor">A12-13</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—It is inconceivable that the doctors at Parkland Hospital
did not turn the President over on his face and notice the bullet
hole in the back of his neck.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Doctors at Parkland Hospital have testified
that the President remained on his back while he was at Parkland
Hospital for treatment and that they did not turn him over at any
time; they were busy trying to save his life. Consequently, they were
never aware of the hole in the back of his neck until they were notified
of it later.<a id="FNanchor_A12-14" href="#Footnote_A12-14" class="fnanchor">A12-14</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The first shot struck the President in the throat as
the car was proceeding along Houston Street toward the Texas School
Book Depository. The car then made a left turn on to Elm Street
and proceeded for some distance before additional shots were fired
at the President.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Before the autopsy findings made it clear that
the shots were fired from the rear, there was speculation that the first
shot may have been fired before the Presidential car turned on to Elm
Street. As this report demonstrates, all of the shots that struck the
President were fired from the rear and in a time period inconsistent
with the theory that the first shot struck him while his car was coming
down Houston Street. Motion pictures taken at the time show that
the first shot struck the President after the car had turned onto Elm
Street and was proceeding away from the Depository.<a id="FNanchor_A12-15" href="#Footnote_A12-15" class="fnanchor">A12-15</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr233">THE ASSASSIN</h3>

<p>Speculations tending to support the theory that Oswald could not
have assassinated President Kennedy are based on a wide variety of
assertions. Among these are statements that Oswald could not have
been acquainted with the motorcade route before he came to work on
November 22, that he may well have carried curtain rods rather than
a rifle in a brown paper package he brought with him, that there may
have been other people in the building who could have fired the rifle,
that Oswald could not have fired the shots in the time available to him,
that he was not a good enough marksman to have scored the hits with
the rifle, that there were other people in the lunchroom of the Depository
Building when he was confronted by Patrolman M. L. Baker,
and that there are no eyewitnesses who could identify Oswald as
having been in the window. Each of these speculations is dealt with
below in the light of the testimony and evidence considered by the
Commission.</p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald could not have known the motorcade route
before he arrived at work on November 22.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The motorcade route was published in both
Dallas papers on November 19 and was therefore available at least
72 hours before Oswald reported for work on November 22.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_643">643</span><a id="FNanchor_A12-16" href="#Footnote_A12-16" class="fnanchor">A12-16</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The route as shown in the newspaper took the motorcade
through the Triple Underpass via Main Street, a block away from
the Depository. Therefore, Oswald could not have known that the
motorcade would pass directly by the Texas School Book Depository
Building.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The motorcade route as published showed
the motorcade turning right off Main Street onto Houston for one
block and then left on Elm to the access road to the Stemmons Freeway.
This route was clearly indicated in published descriptions and
maps of the motorcade route. There was no mention of continuing
on Main Street through the Triple Underpass.<a id="FNanchor_A12-17" href="#Footnote_A12-17" class="fnanchor">A12-17</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The motorcade route was changed on November 22
after the map had been printed. The motorcade was shifted from
Main Street over to Elm Street to bring it by the Texas School Book
Depository Building.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The motorcade route was decided upon on
November 18 and published in the Dallas newspapers on November
19. It was not changed in any way thereafter. The route called for
the motorcade to turn off Main Street at Houston, go up to Elm, and
then turn left on Elm Street.<a id="FNanchor_A12-18" href="#Footnote_A12-18" class="fnanchor">A12-18</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The normal and logical route would have been
straight down Main Street through the Triple Underpass to the Stemmons
Freeway. It is possible to drive from Main onto the access
road to the Stemmons Freeway from a point beyond the underpass.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The normal, direct, and only permissible
route to the Stemmons Freeway from Main Street is via Houston and
Elm Streets. Any attempt to turn onto the access road to the Stemmons
Freeway from Main Street beyond the Triple Underpass would
have been extremely difficult because of a concrete strip dividing Elm
and Main Streets. Such an attempt would have required making an
S-turn beyond the strip at a very tight angle, thereby slowing the
Presidential car almost to a stop.<a id="FNanchor_A12-19" href="#Footnote_A12-19" class="fnanchor">A12-19</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald may well have carried curtain rods to work
on November 22 in the brown paper package he was observed to bring
into the building because he lived in a room where he needed them.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—According to Oswald’s landlady at 1026
North Beckley Avenue, Mrs. A. C. Johnson, the room had venetian
blinds, curtain rods, and curtains while Oswald was living there. The
curtain rods in the Paine garage that belonged to Mrs. Paine were
still there after Oswald went to work on November 22. Mrs. Paine
and Marina Oswald testified that Oswald had not spoken to them
about curtain rods. After the assassination the empty package was
found near the window from which the shots were fired, but no curtain
rods were found.<a id="FNanchor_A12-20" href="#Footnote_A12-20" class="fnanchor">A12-20</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald spent the morning of November 22 in the
company of other workers in the building and remained with them
until they went downstairs to watch the President go by, no later
probably than 12:15.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_644">644</span>
<i>Commission finding.</i>—Oswald did not spend the morning in the
company of other workers in the building, and before the assassination
he was last seen in the building on the sixth floor at about 11:55
a.m. by Charles Givens, another employee.<a id="FNanchor_A12-21" href="#Footnote_A12-21" class="fnanchor">A12-21</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—It is probable that the chicken lunch, remains of which
were found on the sixth floor, was eaten by an accomplice of Oswald
who had hidden on the sixth floor overnight.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The chicken lunch had been eaten shortly
after noon on November 22 by Bonnie Ray Williams, an employee of
the Texas School Book Depository, who after eating his lunch went
to the fifth floor where he was when the shots were fired. Oswald did
not eat the chicken lunch, nor did he drink from the soft drink bottle
found near the chicken lunch.<a id="FNanchor_A12-22" href="#Footnote_A12-22" class="fnanchor">A12-22</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Laboratory tests showed remains of the chicken lunch
found on the sixth floor were 2 days old.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The chicken lunch remains had been left
there shortly after noon on November 22 by Bonnie Ray Williams.<a id="FNanchor_A12-23" href="#Footnote_A12-23" class="fnanchor">A12-23</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—An amateur 8-millimeter photograph taken at 12:20
p.m., 10 minutes before the assassination of President Kennedy,
showed two silhouettes at the sixth-floor window of the Depository.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—A film taken by an amateur photographer,
Robert J. E. Hughes, just before the assassination, shows a shadow in
the southeast corner window of the sixth floor. This has been determined
after examination by the FBI and the U.S. Navy Photographic
Interpretation Center to be the shadow from the cartons near the
window.<a id="FNanchor_A12-24" href="#Footnote_A12-24" class="fnanchor">A12-24</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—A picture published widely in newspapers and magazines
after the assassination showed Lee Harvey Oswald standing on
the front steps of the Texas School Book Depository Building shortly
before the President’s motorcade passed by.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The man on the front steps of the building,
thought or alleged by some to be Lee Harvey Oswald, is actually Billy
Lovelady, an employee of the Texas School Book Depository, who
somewhat resembles Oswald. Lovelady has identified himself in the
picture, and other employees of the Depository standing with him, as
shown in the picture, have verified that he was the man in the picture
and that Oswald was not there.<a id="FNanchor_A12-25" href="#Footnote_A12-25" class="fnanchor">A12-25</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The post office box in Dallas to which Oswald had
the rifle mailed was kept under both his name and that of A. Hidell.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—It is not known whether Oswald’s application
listed the name A. Hidell as one entitled to receive mail at the
box. In accordance with U.S. Post Office regulations, the portion of
the application listing the names of persons other than the applicant
entitled to receive mail was discarded after the box was closed on
May 14, 1963. During the summer of 1963, Oswald rented a post
office box in New Orleans, listing the name “Hidell” in addition to his
own name and that of his wife. Hidell was a favorite alias used by
Oswald on a number of occasions. Diligent search has failed to reveal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_645">645</span>
any person in Dallas or New Orleans by that name. It was
merely a creation for his own purposes.<a id="FNanchor_A12-26" href="#Footnote_A12-26" class="fnanchor">A12-26</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The President’s car was going at a speed estimated
at from 12 to 20 miles per hour, thus presenting a target comparable
to the most difficult that a soldier would encounter under battlefield
conditions.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—During the period between the time that the
first and second shots struck the President, the Presidential car was
traveling at an average speed of approximately 11.2 miles per hour.
Expert witnesses testified that the target is regarded as a favorable
one because the car was going away from the marksman in a straight
line.<a id="FNanchor_A12-27" href="#Footnote_A12-27" class="fnanchor">A12-27</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald could not have fired three shots from the
Mannlicher-Carcano rifle in 5½ seconds.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—According to expert witnesses, exacting tests
conducted for the Commission demonstrated that it was possible to fire
three shots from the rifle within 5½ seconds. It should be noted that
the first loaded shell was already in the chamber ready for firing; Oswald
had only to pull the trigger to fire the first shot and to work the
bolt twice in order to fire the second and third shots. They testified
that if the second shot missed, Oswald had between 4.8 and 5.6 seconds
to fire the three shots. If either the first or third shot missed, Oswald
had in excess of 7 seconds to fire the three shots.<a id="FNanchor_A12-28" href="#Footnote_A12-28" class="fnanchor">A12-28</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald did not have the marksmanship ability demonstrated
by the rifleman who fired the shots.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Oswald qualified as a sharpshooter and a
marksman with the M-1 rifle in the Marine Corps. Marina Oswald
testified that in New Orleans her husband practiced operating the
bolt of the rifle. Moreover, experts stated that the scope was a substantial
aid for rapid, accurate firing. The Commission concluded
that Oswald had the capability with a rifle to commit
assassination.<a id="FNanchor_A12-29" href="#Footnote_A12-29" class="fnanchor">A12-29</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The name of the rifle used in the assassination appeared
on the rifle. Therefore, the searchers who found the rifle on
the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository should have been
able to identify it correctly by name.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—An examination of the rifle does not reveal
any manufacturer’s name. An inscription on the rifle shows that it
was made in Italy. The rifle was identified by Captain Fritz and
Lieutenant Day, who were the first to actually handle it.<a id="FNanchor_A12-30" href="#Footnote_A12-30" class="fnanchor">A12-30</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School
Book Depository was identified as a 7.65 Mauser by the man who found
it, Deputy Constable Seymour Weitzman.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Weitzman, the original source of the speculation
that the rifle was a Mauser, and Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone
found the weapon. Weitzman did not handle the rifle and did not
examine it at close range. He had little more than a glimpse
of it and thought it was a Mauser, a German bolt-type rifle similar in
appearance to the Mannlicher-Carcano. Police laboratory technicians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_646">646</span>
subsequently arrived and correctly identified the weapon as a 6.5
Italian rifle.<a id="FNanchor_A12-31" href="#Footnote_A12-31" class="fnanchor">A12-31</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—There is evidence that a second rifle was discovered
on the roof of the Texas School Book Depository or on the overpass.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—No second rifle was found in either of these
places or in any other place. The shots that struck President Kennedy
and Governor Connally came from the rifle found on the sixth floor of
the Texas School Book Depository.<a id="FNanchor_A12-32" href="#Footnote_A12-32" class="fnanchor">A12-32</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—It is possible that there was a second Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle involved in the assassination. The Irving Sports Shop
mounted a scope on a rifle 3 weeks before the assassination.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Dial D. Ryder, an employee of the Irving
Sports Shop, has stated that he found on his workbench on November
23 an undated work tag with the name “Oswald” on it, indicating
that sometime during the first 2 weeks of November three holes had
been bored in a rifle and a telescopic sight mounted on it and bore-sighted.
However, Ryder and his employer, Charles W. Greener,
had no recollection of Oswald, of his Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, of the
transaction allegedly represented by the repair tag, or of any person
for whom such a repair was supposedly made. The rifle found on
the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository had two holes
in it bored for the installation of a scope prior to shipment to Oswald
in March 1963. The Commission concluded that it is doubtful whether
the tag produced by Ryder was authentic. All of the evidence developed
proves that Oswald owned only the one rifle—the Mannlicher-Carcano—and
that he did not bring it or a second rifle to the Irving
Sports Shop.<a id="FNanchor_A12-33" href="#Footnote_A12-33" class="fnanchor">A12-33</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Ammunition for the rifle found on the sixth floor of
the Texas School Book Depository had not been manufactured since
the end of World War II. The ammunition used by Oswald must,
therefore, have been at least 20 years old, making it extremely unreliable.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The ammunition used in the rifle was American
ammunition recently made by the Western Cartridge Co., which
manufactures such ammunition currently. In tests with the same
kind of ammunition, experts fired Oswald’s Mannlicher-Carcano rifle
more than 100 times without any misfires.<a id="FNanchor_A12-34" href="#Footnote_A12-34" class="fnanchor">A12-34</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The assertion that Oswald’s palmprint appeared on
the rifle is false. The FBI told newsmen in an off-the-record briefing
session that there was no palmprint on the rifle.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The FBI confirmed that the palmprint lifted
by the Dallas police from the rifle found on the sixth floor of the
Texas School Book Depository Building was Oswald’s palmprint.
The FBI informed the Commission that no FBI agent made statements
of any type to the press concerning the existence or nonexistence
of this print.<a id="FNanchor_A12-35" href="#Footnote_A12-35" class="fnanchor">A12-35</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—If Oswald had been gloveless, he would have left
fingerprints on the rifle because he would not have had time to wipe
the prints off the rifle after he had fired it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_647">647</span>
<i>Commission finding.</i>—An FBI fingerprint expert testified that the
poor quality of the metal and wooden parts would cause them to
absorb moisture from the skin, thereby making a clear print unlikely.
There is no evidence that Oswald wore gloves or that he wiped prints
off the rifle. Latent fingerprints were found on the rifle but they
were too incomplete to be identified.<a id="FNanchor_A12-36" href="#Footnote_A12-36" class="fnanchor">A12-36</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Gordon Shanklin, the special agent in charge of the
Dallas office of the FBI, stated that the paraffin test of Oswald’s face
and hands was positive and proved that he had fired a rifle.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The paraffin tests were conducted by members
of the Dallas Police Department and the technical examinations
by members of the Dallas City-County Criminal Investigation Laboratory.
The FBI has notified the Commission that neither Shanklin
nor any other representative of the FBI ever made such a statement.
The Commission has found no evidence that Special Agent Shanklin
ever made this statement publicly.<a id="FNanchor_A12-37" href="#Footnote_A12-37" class="fnanchor">A12-37</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Marina Oswald stated that she did not know that her
husband owned a rifle nor did she know that he owned a pistol.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—There is no evidence that Marina Oswald
ever told this to any authorities. On the afternoon of November 22,
she told the police that her husband owned a rifle and that he kept
it in the garage of the Paine house in Irving. Later, at Dallas police
headquarters, she said that she could not identify as her husband’s
the rifle shown her by policemen. When Marina Oswald appeared
before the Commission she was shown the Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5
rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository and identified it as the
“fateful rifle of Lee Oswald.”<a id="FNanchor_A12-38" href="#Footnote_A12-38" class="fnanchor">A12-38</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The picture of Oswald taken by his wife in March
or April 1963 and showing him with a rifle and a pistol was “doctored”
when it appeared in magazines and newspapers in February
1964. The rifle held by Oswald in these pictures is not the same rifle
that was found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository
Building.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Life magazine, Newsweek, and the New York
Times notified the Commission that they had retouched this picture.
In doing so, they inadvertently altered details of the configuration of
the rifle. The original prints of this picture have been examined
by the Commission and by photographic experts who have identified
the rifle as a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5, the same kind as the one found
on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. FBI experts
testified that the picture was taken with Oswald’s camera.<a id="FNanchor_A12-39" href="#Footnote_A12-39" class="fnanchor">A12-39</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The rifle picture of Oswald was a composite one with
Oswald’s face pasted on somebody else’s body.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Marina Oswald has testified that she took
this picture with a camera owned by her husband and subsequently
identified as Oswald’s Imperial Reflex camera. She identified the man
in the picture as her husband. Experts also state the picture was
not a composite.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_648">648</span><a id="FNanchor_A12-40" href="#Footnote_A12-40" class="fnanchor">A12-40</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—After firing the shots, Oswald could not have disposed
of the rifle and descended the stairs to the lunchroom in time to get
a drink from a soft drink machine and be there when Patrolman
Baker came in.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—A series of time tests made by investigators
and by Roy S. Truly and Patrolman M. L. Baker at the request of
the Commission, show that it was possible for Oswald to have placed
the rifle behind a box and descended to the lunchroom on the second
floor before Patrolman Baker and Truly got up there. Oswald did
not have a soft drink bottle in his hand at the time he was confronted
by Baker and he was not standing by the soft drink machine. He
was just entering the lunchroom; Baker caught a glimpse of him
through the glass panel in the door leading to the lunchroom
vestibule.<a id="FNanchor_A12-41" href="#Footnote_A12-41" class="fnanchor">A12-41</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—There were other people present in the lunchroom at
the time that Baker and Truly saw Oswald there.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Baker and Truly have both stated that there
was no one in the lunchroom other than Oswald at the time that they
entered. No other witness to this incident has been found.<a id="FNanchor_A12-42" href="#Footnote_A12-42" class="fnanchor">A12-42</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Police were sealing off all exits from the building by
the time Oswald got to the second floor.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Police may have begun to take up positions
at the exits to the building as early as 12:33, but it is unlikely
that they had blocked them off completely until 12:37 p.m. at the
earliest. Oswald was seen in an office, walking toward an exit leading
to the front stairway, at about 12:33 p.m. Oswald probably had
at least 7 minutes in which to get out of the building without being
stopped.<a id="FNanchor_A12-43" href="#Footnote_A12-43" class="fnanchor">A12-43</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr234">OSWALD’S MOVEMENTS BETWEEN 12:33 AND 1:15 P.M.</h3>

<p>One of the major theses urged in support of the theory that Oswald
did not murder Patrolman Tippit was that his known movements after
he left the Texas School Book Depository would not have permitted
him to have arrived at 10th Street and Patton Avenue in time to encounter
Tippit by 1:16 p.m. Careful reenactments by investigative
agencies and by members of the Commission staff of Oswald’s movements
from the time he left the Texas School Book Depository until
he encountered Tippit verified that Oswald could reach his roominghouse
at 1026 North Beckley Avenue at approximately 1 p.m. or
earlier. The housekeeper at the roominghouse testified that Oswald
spent only a few minutes at the house, leaving as hurriedly as he
had arrived. During police interrogation after his arrest, Oswald
admitted to riding both bus and taxi in returning to his roominghouse
after the assassination of the President. From 1026 North Beckley
Avenue, Oswald could easily have walked the nine tenths of a mile
to 10th Street and Patton Avenue where he encountered Tippit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_649">649</span>
<i>Speculation.</i>—A detailed and remarkably clear description of
Oswald was sent over the police radio in Dallas at 12:36 p.m., November
22, 1963.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The radio logs of the Dallas Police Department
and the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office show that no description of
a suspect in the assassination of the President was broadcast before
12:45 p.m. on that day. No reference to Oswald by name was broadcast
before he was arrested. The description of the suspect that was
broadcast was similar to that of Oswald, but it lacked some important
specific details such as color of hair and eyes. The information for
the initial broadcasts most probably came from Howard Brennan, who
saw Oswald in the window when he was firing the rifle.<a id="FNanchor_A12-44" href="#Footnote_A12-44" class="fnanchor">A12-44</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald did not have time for all of the movements
imputed to him between his departure from the Texas School Book
Depository and his encounter with Tippit.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Time tests of all of Oswald’s movements
establish that these movements could have been accomplished in the
time available to him.<a id="FNanchor_A12-45" href="#Footnote_A12-45" class="fnanchor">A12-45</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald was stopped by police as he left the building
and was permitted to pass after he told them he worked in the building.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Commission has found no witness who
saw Oswald leave the building. This speculation is probably a misinterpretation
of the fact that he was stopped in the lunchroom by
Patrolman Baker before he left the building and was allowed to proceed
after Truly, the Depository superintendent, identified him as an
employee there. Police did not seal off the building until at least
several minutes after Oswald could have left.<a id="FNanchor_A12-46" href="#Footnote_A12-46" class="fnanchor">A12-46</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The log of the cabdriver who took Oswald to North
Beckley Avenue, William W. Whaley, shows that Oswald entered his
cab at 12:30 p.m. Since this occurred at some distance from the point
of the President’s assassination, Oswald could not have shot the
President.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Whaley’s log does show 12:30 p.m., but he has
testified that he was not accurate in logging the time that passengers
entered his cab, that he usually logged them at 15-minute intervals,
and that it was undoubtedly some time later than 12:30 when Oswald
entered his cab. Sometimes he did not make entries in his logbook
until three or four trips later. The bus transfer in Oswald’s possession
was issued after 12:36 p.m. The Commission has determined that
Oswald probably entered Whaley’s cab at about 12:47 or 12:48 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_A12-47" href="#Footnote_A12-47" class="fnanchor">A12-47</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The distance from the Greyhound terminal in Dallas,
where Oswald entered the cab, to North Beckley Avenue, where he
probably left the cab, is something over 3 miles—normally a 10-minute
cab drive. Given the traffic jam that existed at the time, it
is doubtful that Whaley could have made the trip in less than 15
minutes. One estimate has placed the time at 24 minutes from the
Greyhound terminal to Oswald’s roominghouse.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The distance from the Greyhound bus terminal
at Jackson and Lamar Streets to the 500 block of North Beckley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_650">650</span>
is 2.5 miles. Oswald actually got out in the 700 block of North Beckley.
The distance was, therefore, less than 2.5 miles. Whaley has
testified to the Commission that the trip took 6 minutes. Test runs
made by members of the Commission staff under traffic conditions
somewhat similar to those that existed on November 22, took approximately
5 minutes and 30 seconds. To walk from Beckley and Neely,
which is the 700 block of Beckley, where Oswald probably left the cab,
to 1026 North Beckley, took Commission staff members 5 minutes and 45 seconds.<a id="FNanchor_A12-48" href="#Footnote_A12-48" class="fnanchor">A12-48</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald was on his way to Jack Ruby’s apartment
when he was stopped by Patrolman Tippit.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—There is no evidence that Oswald and Ruby
knew each other or had any relationship through a third party or
parties. There is no evidence that Oswald knew where Ruby lived.
Accordingly, there is neither evidence nor reason to believe that
Oswald was on his way to Ruby’s apartment when he was stopped by
Tippit.<a id="FNanchor_A12-49" href="#Footnote_A12-49" class="fnanchor">A12-49</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr235">MURDER OF TIPPIT</h3>

<p>Speculations on the murder of Tippit centered about assertions that
he was elsewhere than he was supposed to be when he was shot, that
he knew the man who shot him, and that the description of the
murderer given by one of the eyewitnesses did not fit Oswald’s description.</p>

<p>The Commission found that Tippit was unquestionably patrolling
in an area to which he had been directed by police headquarters.
There was no evidence to support the speculation that Tippit and
Oswald knew each other or had ever seen each other before. The
description of the murderer imputed to one of the witnesses was denied
by her and had no support from any other eyewitness.</p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Tippit was driving alone in his police car even
though standing orders for police in Dallas were that radio cars of
the type Tippit was driving must have two policemen in them.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Dallas police officials stated that department
policy required about 80 percent of the patrolmen on the day shift,
7 a.m. to 3 p.m., to work alone. Tippit was one of the patrolmen assigned
to work alone that day.<a id="FNanchor_A12-50" href="#Footnote_A12-50" class="fnanchor">A12-50</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Tippit was violating an order he had received the day
before not to leave the sector to which he had been assigned. This
sector was supposed to be in downtown Dallas at the time he stopped
Oswald.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—A review of Tippit’s file in the Dallas Police
Department and the department’s radio log revealed that following
the shooting of the President, Tippit was directed to move into and
remain in the central Oak Cliff area available for any emergency.<a id="FNanchor_A12-51" href="#Footnote_A12-51" class="fnanchor">A12-51</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The police had been withdrawn from the area in
which Tippit found Oswald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_651">651</span>
<i>Commission finding.</i>—Other police cars were operating in the Oak
Cliff area at the same time as Tippit. They participated in the subsequent
search for and apprehension of Tippit’s slayer.<a id="FNanchor_A12-52" href="#Footnote_A12-52" class="fnanchor">A12-52</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Tippit violated a procedure governing radio cars
when he failed to notify headquarters that he was stopping to question
a suspect.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Dallas Police Department had no requirement
or regulation for police officers to notify headquarters
when stopping to question a suspect. Therefore, Tippit did not violate
any police radio procedure in failing to notify the radio dispatcher
that he was stopping Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A12-53" href="#Footnote_A12-53" class="fnanchor">A12-53</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Tippit could not have recognized Oswald from the
description sent out over the police radio.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—There is no certain way of knowing whether
Tippit recognized Oswald from the description put out by the police
radio. The Dallas Police Department radio log shows that the
police radio dispatcher at 1:29 p.m. noted a similarity between the
broadcast descriptions of the President’s assassin and Tippit’s slayer.
It is conceivable, even probable, that Tippit stopped Oswald because
of the description broadcast by the police radio.<a id="FNanchor_A12-54" href="#Footnote_A12-54" class="fnanchor">A12-54</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Tippit and his killer knew each other.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Investigation has revealed no evidence that
Oswald and Tippit were acquainted, had ever seen each other, or
had any mutual acquaintances. Witnesses to the shooting observed
no signs of recognition between the two men.<a id="FNanchor_A12-55" href="#Footnote_A12-55" class="fnanchor">A12-55</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Mrs. Helen Markham, a witness to the slaying of
Tippit, put the time at just after 1:06 p.m. This would have made
it impossible for Oswald to have committed the killing since he would
not have had time to arrive at the shooting scene by that time.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The shooting of Tippit has been established
at approximately 1:15 or 1:16 p.m. on the basis of a call to police headquarters
on Tippit’s car radio by another witness to the assassination,
Domingo Benavides. In her various statements and in her
testimony, Mrs. Markham was uncertain and inconsistent in her recollection
of the exact time of the slaying.<a id="FNanchor_A12-56" href="#Footnote_A12-56" class="fnanchor">A12-56</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Mrs. Helen Markham is the only witness to the killing
of Tippit.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Other witnesses to the killing of Tippit include
Domingo Benavides, who used Tippit’s car radio to notify the
police dispatcher of the killing at 1:16 p.m., and William Scoggins,
a cabdriver parked at the corner of 10th Street and Patton Avenue.
Barbara Jeanette Davis and Virginia Davis saw a man with a pistol
in his hand walk across their lawn immediately after they heard the
sound of the shots that killed Tippit. The man emptied the shells from
his pistol and turned the corner from 10th Street onto Patton Avenue.
All of these witnesses, except Benavides, subsequently picked Oswald
out of a lineup as the slayer. Benavides did not feel that he could
make a positive identification and never attended a lineup for the
purpose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_652">652</span><a id="FNanchor_A12-57" href="#Footnote_A12-57" class="fnanchor">A12-57</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Mrs. Markham said that the man she saw shooting
Tippit was about 30, short, with bushy hair, and wearing a white coat.
Since Oswald does not fit this description he could not be the killer.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—In evaluating Helen Markham’s testimony
the Commission is aware of allegations that she described the killer
of Patrolman Tippit as short, stocky, and with bushy hair, which
would not be a correct description of Oswald. It has also been
alleged that Mrs. Markham identified Oswald in the lineup because
of his clothing rather than his appearance. When Oswald appeared
in the lineup at which Mrs. Markham was present, he was not wearing
the jacket which he wore at the time of the shooting, and Mrs. Markham
has testified that her identification was based “mostly from his
face.”<a id="FNanchor_A12-58" href="#Footnote_A12-58" class="fnanchor">A12-58</a> Moreover, Mrs. Markham has denied that she ever described
the man who killed Tippit as short, stocky, and with bushy hair. The
Commission reviewed the transcript of a telephone conversation in
which Mrs. Markham was alleged to have made such a description.
In the transcription Mrs. Markham reaffirmed her positive identification
of Oswald and denied having described the killer as short, stocky,
and bushy haired.<a id="FNanchor_A12-59" href="#Footnote_A12-59" class="fnanchor">A12-59</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Another witness to the slaying of Patrolman Tippit,
an unidentified woman, was interviewed by the FBI but was never
called as a witness by the President’s Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy. This witness is alleged to have stated that
she saw two men involved in the shooting and that they ran off in
opposite directions afterward.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The only woman among the witnesses to the
slaying of Tippit known to the Commission is Helen Markham. The
FBI never interviewed any other woman who claimed to have seen
the shooting and never received any information concerning the existence
of such a witness. Two women, Barbara Jeanette Davis and
Virginia Davis, saw the killer immediately after the shooting as
he crossed the lawn at the corner of Patton Avenue and 10th Street,
but they did not witness the shooting itself. They were both interviewed
by the FBI and appeared before the Commission. The Commission
has no evidence that there was any witness to the slaying
other than those identified in chapter IV.<a id="FNanchor_A12-60" href="#Footnote_A12-60" class="fnanchor">A12-60</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—No witness saw Oswald between the time he was
supposed to have reloaded his gun near the scene of the slaying and
his appearance at the shoestore on Jefferson Boulevard.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Six witnesses identified Oswald as the man
they saw in flight after the murder of Tippit. The killer was
seen, gun in hand, by Ted Callaway and Sam Guinyard in the block
of Patton Avenue between 10th Street and Jefferson Boulevard after
the shooting of Tippit. They saw him run to Jefferson and turn right.
On the evening of November 22, Callaway and Guinyard picked
Oswald out of a police lineup as the man they saw with the gun.
Two other men, Warren Reynolds and Pat Patterson, saw a man
with a pistol in his hand running south on Patton Avenue. They
followed him for a block on Jefferson Boulevard and then lost sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_653">653</span>
of him. Both men subsequently identified pictures of Oswald as the
man they saw with the gun. Harold Russell also saw a man with a
gun running south on Patton Avenue and later identified him from
pictures as Oswald. Mrs. Mary Brock saw a man she later identified
as Oswald walk at a fast pace into the parking lot behind the service
station at the corner of Jefferson and Crawford, where Oswald’s
jacket was found shortly after.<a id="FNanchor_A12-61" href="#Footnote_A12-61" class="fnanchor">A12-61</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—When Oswald left his roominghouse at about 1 p.m.
on November 22 he had on a zipper-type tan plaid jacket.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The jacket that Oswald was wearing at the
time of the slaying of Tippit was a light-gray jacket. According to
Marina Oswald, her husband owned only two jackets—one blue and
the other light gray. The housekeeper at 1026 North Beckley Avenue,
Mrs. Earlene Roberts, was not certain about the color of the jacket
that Oswald was wearing when he left the house.<a id="FNanchor_A12-62" href="#Footnote_A12-62" class="fnanchor">A12-62</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald wore an olive-brown plain jacket which is
visible in all the pictures of him after his arrest.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—At the time of his arrest, Oswald was not
wearing a jacket. The jacket that was subsequently recovered in a
parking lot and identified as Oswald’s was a light-gray one. There
are no witnesses who have stated that Oswald was wearing an olive-brown
jacket immediately before or after his arrest. The Commission
has seen no pictures of Oswald taken subsequent to his arrest
that show him in such a jacket. Pictures taken shortly after his
arrest show him in the shirt that Mrs. Bledsoe described him as wearing
when she saw him on the bus at approximately 1:40 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_A12-63" href="#Footnote_A12-63" class="fnanchor">A12-63</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald’s landlady, Mrs. A. C. Johnson, said that
Oswald never had a gun in the room.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—In her testimony before the Commission, Mrs.
Johnson said that he “never brought that rifle in my house. * * * He
could have had this pistol, I don’t know, because they found the
scabbard.”<a id="FNanchor_A12-64" href="#Footnote_A12-64" class="fnanchor">A12-64</a> As shown in chapter IV, Oswald kept his rifle in the
Paine garage in Irving while he was living in Dallas during October
and November. The pistol was small and easily concealed.<a id="FNanchor_A12-65" href="#Footnote_A12-65" class="fnanchor">A12-65</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—There was absolutely no place to hide a gun in
Oswald’s room at 1026 North Beckley Avenue.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—In the search of Oswald’s room after his
apprehension police found a pistol holster. Oswald’s landlady, Mrs.
A. C. Johnson, stated that she had not seen the holster before.
There is no reason to believe that Oswald could not have had both a
pistol and the holster hidden in the room. Oswald’s pistol was a
small one with the barrel cut down to 2¼ inches. It could have been
concealed in a pocket of his clothes.<a id="FNanchor_A12-66" href="#Footnote_A12-66" class="fnanchor">A12-66</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald did not pick up the revolver from his room
at 1 p.m.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—There is reason to believe that Oswald did
pick up the revolver from his room, probably concealing it beneath
his jacket. This likelihood is reinforced by the finding of the pistol
holster in the room after the assassination, since this indicates that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_654">654</span>
Oswald did not store the pistol at the home of Mrs. Paine where he
spent the night before the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_A12-67" href="#Footnote_A12-67" class="fnanchor">A12-67</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—No one saw Oswald enter the Texas Theatre.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—A nearby shoe store manager, Johnny C.
Brewer, and the theatre cashier, Julia Postal, saw Oswald enter the
lobby of the theatre from where he went on into the theatre proper.<a id="FNanchor_A12-68" href="#Footnote_A12-68" class="fnanchor">A12-68</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Not a single one of the people in the Texas Theatre at
the time of Oswald’s arrest has come forward or been brought forward
to give an eyewitness account of the arrest.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Johnny C. Brewer, the shoe store manager,
and two patrons of the theatre—John Gibson and George Jefferson
Applin, Jr.—were present in the theatre and testified before the Commission
on the circumstances of Oswald’s arrest at the Texas Theatre.
Only 6 or 7 people were seated on the main floor of the theatre.<a id="FNanchor_A12-69" href="#Footnote_A12-69" class="fnanchor">A12-69</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—There is no independent witness aside from the police
who testified that Oswald was carrying a gun when arrested by the
police.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Johnny Brewer testified before the Commission
that he saw Oswald pull a gun and that he saw it taken away
from him by a policeman.<a id="FNanchor_A12-70" href="#Footnote_A12-70" class="fnanchor">A12-70</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr236">OSWALD AFTER HIS ARREST</h3>

<p>The Commission found that assertions that the Dallas police treated
Oswald brutally and denied him his constitutional rights to legal
counsel had no foundation in fact. Insinuations that Dallas police
officials and District Attorney Henry M. Wade fabricated or altered
evidence to establish the guilt of Oswald were baseless. It is true
that police officials and the district attorney made errors in giving
evidential information to the press, but these were clearly the result
of misapprehensions or ignorance rather than intent, and at the worst
represent bad judgment. At least one imputed fabrication of fact,
further embellished by repetition, never really occurred. Sinister
connotations were evoked by the attribution to the district attorney of
the statement that a taxicab driver named Darryl Click drove Oswald
from downtown Dallas to the area of his roominghouse in Oak Cliff.
It has been correctly ascertained that no such taxicab driver existed in
Dallas. On the other hand, the district attorney, who was quoted in
a newspaper transcript as making the statement, never made the statement
nor did any one else. Audio tapes of the district attorney’s
press conference make clear that the person who transcribed the conference
rendered a reference to the “Oak Cliff” area of Dallas as a
person, “Darryl Click”. This error in transcription is the sole source
for the existence of a “Darryl Click” as a taxicab driver.</p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald was the victim of police brutality.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Oswald resisted arrest in the Texas Theatre
and drew a gun. He received a slight cut over his right eye and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_655">655</span>
bruise under his left eye in the course of his struggles. During the
time he was in police custody, he was neither ill-treated nor abused.<a id="FNanchor_A12-71" href="#Footnote_A12-71" class="fnanchor">A12-71</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald was never formally charged with the assassination
of the President; he was charged only with the shooting of
Patrolman J. D. Tippit.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Oswald was arraigned for the murder of
President Kennedy before Justice of the Peace David Johnston on
the fourth floor of the Police Department building at 1:35 a.m., November
23. Previously, he had been arraigned before Johnston for
the murder of Tippit at 7:10 p.m., November 22.<a id="FNanchor_A12-72" href="#Footnote_A12-72" class="fnanchor">A12-72</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The police questioned Oswald extensively about the
Tippit murder on the first day of his detention. They did not question
him about the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Dallas police officials stated that they questioned
Oswald repeatedly on November 22 about the assassination of
President Kennedy and his relationship to it. At the first interrogation,
Captain Fritz asked Oswald to account for himself at the time
the President was shot. FBI agents who were present also stated that
he was questioned about the assassination of the President.<a id="FNanchor_A12-73" href="#Footnote_A12-73" class="fnanchor">A12-73</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald’s attempts to get legal counsel were deliberately
thwarted by the police and he was cut off from outside calls
that would have permitted him to obtain a lawyer.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—On November 23, Oswald was visited by the
president of the Dallas Bar Association, H. Louis Nichols, who offered
him help in getting a lawyer; Oswald refused the offer. Oswald was
told by the police that he could use the telephone when he wished, and
he did make telephone calls. He attempted to call attorney John
Abt in New York but was unsuccessful in reaching him. Mrs.
Paine testified that at Oswald’s request she tried without success to
reach Abt. Oswald was also visited by his wife, mother, and brother,
to any of whom he could have turned for help in getting counsel.<a id="FNanchor_A12-74" href="#Footnote_A12-74" class="fnanchor">A12-74</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr237">OSWALD IN THE SOVIET UNION</h3>

<p>Oswald’s residence in the Soviet Union for more than 2½ years
aroused speculation after his arrest that he was an agent of the Soviet
Union or in some way affiliated with it. This speculation was supported
by assertions that he had received exceptionally favored treatment
from the Soviet Government in securing permission to enter and
leave the country, especially the latter, because his Russian wife and
child were permitted to leave with him. The careful analysis of these
speculations in chapter VI of this report led to the Commission’s conclusion
that there is no credible evidence that Oswald was an agent of
the Soviet Government and that he did not receive unusually favorable
treatment in entering or leaving the Soviet Union or in returning to the
United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_656">656</span>
<i>Speculation.</i>—A young private in the Marine Corps in the 1950’s
could not study Marxism, learn Russian, and read Soviet newspapers
without any adverse repercussions in his unit.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Although Oswald’s interest in the Soviet
Union was well known, his interest in Marxism was apparently known
to only a few of his fellow marines. While stationed in California,
he studied Russian. In February 1959, while still in the Marines, he
took an official test on his proficiency in Russian and was rated “Poor.”
In California at about this time he probably read a Russian-language
newspaper. The reactions of his fellow Marines who were aware of
his interests in Marxism and the Soviet Union were apparently not
antagonistic and did not deter him from pursuing these interests.<a id="FNanchor_A12-75" href="#Footnote_A12-75" class="fnanchor">A12-75</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald learned Russian during his service in the Marines
as part of his military training.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Oswald never received any training from the
Marine Corps in the Russian language. His studies of Russian were
entirely on his own time and at his own initiative.<a id="FNanchor_A12-76" href="#Footnote_A12-76" class="fnanchor">A12-76</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald could not have saved $1,600 from his Marine
pay for his trip to Russia in 1959.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—In November 1959, Oswald told an American
reporter in Moscow, Aline Mosby, that he had saved $1,500 (not $1,600)
while in the Marines. It is entirely consistent with Oswald’s
known frugality that he could have saved the money from the $3,452.20
in pay he received while he was in the Marines. Moreover, despite
his statement to Aline Mosby, he may not actually have saved $1,500,
for it was possible for him to have made the trip to Russia in 1959
for considerably less than that amount.<a id="FNanchor_A12-77" href="#Footnote_A12-77" class="fnanchor">A12-77</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—It is probable that Oswald had prior contacts with
Soviet agents before he entered Russia in 1959 because his application
for a visa was processed and approved immediately on receipt.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—There is no evidence that Oswald was in touch
with Soviet agents before his visit to Russia. The time that it took
for him to receive his visa in Helsinki for entrance to the Soviet Union
was shorter than the average but not beyond the normal range for the
granting of such visas. Had Oswald been recruited as a Russian agent
while he was still in the Marines, it is most improbable that he would
have been encouraged to defect. He would have been of greater value
to Russian intelligence as a Marine radar operator than as a defector.<a id="FNanchor_A12-78" href="#Footnote_A12-78" class="fnanchor">A12-78</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Soviet suspicion of Oswald is indicated by the fact
that he was sent off to work in a radio plant in Minsk as an unskilled
hand at the lowest rate of pay although he qualified as a trained radar
and electronics technician.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Soviet Government probably was suspicious
of Oswald, as it would be of any American who appeared in Moscow
and said he wanted to live in the Soviet Union. Under the circumstances
it is to be expected that he would be placed in a position
that would not involve national security. Moreover, Oswald had
been a radar operator, not a technician, in the Marines. His total
income in Russia was higher than normal because his pay was supplemented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_657">657</span>
for about a year by payments from the Soviet “Red Cross,”
an official agency of the Soviet Government. Oswald believed that
these payments really came from the MVD. It is a policy of the
Soviet Government to subsidize defectors from Western nations who
settle in the Soviet Union, in order that their standard of living may
not be too much lower than their previous standard in their own
country. <a id="FNanchor_A12-79" href="#Footnote_A12-79" class="fnanchor">A12-79</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald was trained by the Russians in a special
school for assassins at Minsk.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Commission investigations revealed no evidence
to support this claim or the existence of such a school in Minsk
during the time Oswald was there. Oswald belonged to a hunting
club near Minsk, but there is no evidence that this was other than an
ordinary hunting club.<a id="FNanchor_A12-80" href="#Footnote_A12-80" class="fnanchor">A12-80</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Marina Oswald’s father was an important part of
the Soviet intelligence apparatus.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Marina Oswald’s father died while she was
still an infant. This reference is presumably to her uncle, Ilya Prusakov,
who was an executive in the lumber industry, which position
carried with it the rank of lieutenant colonel or colonel in the Ministry
of Internal Affairs (MVD). Since 1953 the MVD has not been concerned
with internal security or other police functions.<a id="FNanchor_A12-81" href="#Footnote_A12-81" class="fnanchor">A12-81</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—It was most exceptional that Oswald was able to
bring his wife and child out of the Soviet Union with him.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—There is no reason to believe that the Oswalds
received unusually favorable treatment in being permitted or assisted
to leave the Soviet Union together. Other American citizens have
brought their Russian wives out of the Soviet Union, both before and
after Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A12-82" href="#Footnote_A12-82" class="fnanchor">A12-82</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald never would have been permitted to return
to the United States if Soviet intelligence had not planned to use
him in some way against the United States.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—There is no evidence that Oswald had any
working relationship with the Soviet Government or Soviet intelligence.
The Russians have permitted other American defectors to
return to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A12-83" href="#Footnote_A12-83" class="fnanchor">A12-83</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Since the exit visa for Marina Oswald was granted
so promptly the Soviet authorities must have wanted Marina to accompany
her husband.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Marina Oswald’s exit visa application was
not acted upon with unusual rapidity. It took at least 5½ months
from the time the Oswalds applied until they were notified of permission
in December 1961. There have been many instances where
visas were granted more quickly to other Soviet wives of American
citizens.<a id="FNanchor_A12-84" href="#Footnote_A12-84" class="fnanchor">A12-84</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Soviet authorities gave Oswald notice a month and
a half in advance that they had granted him an exit visa, an unprecedented
act for the Soviet Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_658">658</span>
<i>Commission finding</i>—The Oswalds were notified on December 25,
1961, that their requests for exit visas had been granted by Soviet
authorities. Marina Oswald picked up her visa, valid until December
1, 1962, on January 11, 1962, 17 days after receiving notice that
it was available. Oswald did not pick up his visa until May 22. The
Soviets did not give the Oswalds any advance notice; the visas could
have been picked up immediately had the Oswalds so desired. Because
his exit visa had a 45-day expiration time after date of issuance,
Lee Oswald delayed picking it up until he knew when he was leaving.
He could not arrange a departure date until he received permission
from the Department of State in May to return to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A12-85" href="#Footnote_A12-85" class="fnanchor">A12-85</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr238">OSWALD’S TRIP TO MEXICO CITY</h3>

<p>Oswald’s trip to Mexico City in late September and early October
1963, less than 2 months before he assassinated President Kennedy,
has provoked speculation that it was related in some way to a conspiracy
to murder the President. Rumors include assertions that
he made a clandestine flight from Mexico to Cuba and back and
that he received a large sum of money—usually estimated at $5,000—which
he brought back to Dallas with him. The Commission has no
credible evidence that Oswald went to Mexico pursuant to a plan to
assassinate President Kennedy, that he received any instructions related
to such an action while there, or that he received large sums of
money from any source in Mexico.</p>

<p><i>Speculation</i>—Oswald could not have received an American passport
in June 1963 within 24 hours without special intervention on his behalf.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding</i>—Oswald’s passport application was processed
routinely by the Department of State. No person or agency intervened
specially on his behalf to speed the issuance of the passport.
The passports of 24 other persons, on the same list sent to Washington
from New Orleans, were authorized at the same time. The Passport
Office of the Department of State had no instructions to delay issuance
of or to deny a passport to Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A12-86" href="#Footnote_A12-86" class="fnanchor">A12-86</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The Walter-McCarran Act specifically requires anyone
who has attempted to renounce his U.S. citizenship to file an
affidavit stating why he should receive a U.S. passport. Therefore,
Oswald should have been required to file such an affidavit before receiving
his passport in June 1963.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Internal Security Act of 1950 (Walter-McCarran
Act) contains no reference to an affidavit being required
of a U.S. citizen who has attempted to expatriate himself.<a id="FNanchor_A12-87" href="#Footnote_A12-87" class="fnanchor">A12-87</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald did not have money for his trip to Mexico in
September 1963.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—An analysis of Oswald’s finances by the
Commission indicates that he had sufficient money to make the trip
to and from Mexico City. There is no evidence that he received any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_659">659</span>
assistance in financing his trip to Mexico. The total cost of his 7-day
trip has been reliably estimated at less than $85.<a id="FNanchor_A12-88" href="#Footnote_A12-88" class="fnanchor">A12-88</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald was accompanied on his trip to Mexico City
by a man and two women.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Investigation has revealed that Oswald
traveled alone on the bus. Fellow passengers on the bus between
Houston and Mexico City have stated that he appeared to be traveling
alone and that they had not previously known him.<a id="FNanchor_A12-89" href="#Footnote_A12-89" class="fnanchor">A12-89</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—While in Mexico, Oswald made a clandestine flight
to Havana and back.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Commission has found no evidence that
Oswald made any flight to Cuba while he was in Mexico. He never
received permission from the Cuban Government to enter Cuba nor
from the Mexican Government to leave Mexico bound for Cuba. A
confidential check of the Cuban airline in Mexico City indicates that
Oswald never appeared at its office there.<a id="FNanchor_A12-90" href="#Footnote_A12-90" class="fnanchor">A12-90</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald came back from Mexico City with $5,000.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—No evidence has ever been supplied or obtained
to support this allegation. Oswald’s actions in Mexico City
and after his return to Dallas lend no support to this speculation.<a id="FNanchor_A12-91" href="#Footnote_A12-91" class="fnanchor">A12-91</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—On November 27, 1963, in a speech at the University
of Havana, Fidel Castro, under the influence of liquor, said “The first
time that Oswald was in Cuba * * *.” Castro therefore had knowledge
that Oswald had made surreptitious visits to Cuba.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Castro’s speeches are monitored directly by
the U.S. Information Agency as he delivers them. A tape of this
speech reveals that it did not contain the alleged slip of the tongue.
Castro did refer to Oswald’s visit to the “Cuban Embassy” in Mexico
which he immediately corrected to “Cuban consulate.” The Commission
has found no evidence that Oswald had made surreptitious visits
to Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_A12-92" href="#Footnote_A12-92" class="fnanchor">A12-92</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr239">OSWALD AND U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES</h3>

<p>Rumors and speculations that Oswald was in some way associated
with or used by agencies of the U.S. Government grew out of his
Russian period and his investigation by the FBI after his return to
the United States. Insinuations were made that Oswald had been
a CIA agent or had some relationship with the CIA and that this
explained the supposed ease with which he received passports and
visas. Speculation that he had some working relationship with the
FBI was based on an entry in Oswald’s notebook giving the name
and telephone number of an agent from the FBI office in Dallas. The
Directors of the CIA and the FBI have testified before the Commission
that Oswald was never in the employ of their agencies in any
capacity. The Commission has concluded on the basis of its own investigations
of the files of Federal agencies that Oswald was not and
had never been an agent of any agency of the U.S. Government (aside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_660">660</span>
from his service in the Marines) and was not and had never been used
by any U.S. Government agency for any purpose. The FBI was
interested in him as a former defector and it maintained a file on him.</p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald was an informant of either the FBI or the
CIA. He was recruited by an agency of the U.S. Government and
sent to Russia in 1959.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Mrs. Marguerite Oswald frequently expressed
the opinion that her son was such an agent, but she stated
before the Commission that “I cannot prove Lee is an agent.”<a id="FNanchor_A12-93" href="#Footnote_A12-93" class="fnanchor">A12-93</a> The
Directors of the CIA and of the FBI testified before the Commission
that Oswald was never employed by either agency or used by either
agency in any capacity. Investigation by the Commission has revealed
no evidence that Oswald was ever employed by either the FBI or CIA
in any capacity.<a id="FNanchor_A12-94" href="#Footnote_A12-94" class="fnanchor">A12-94</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald told Pauline Bates, a public stenographer in
Fort Worth, Tex., in June 1962, that he had become a “secret agent”
of the U.S. Government and that he was soon going back to Russia
“for Washington.”</p>

<p><i>Commission-finding.</i>—Miss Bates denied a newspaper story reporting
that Oswald had told her that he was working for the U.S. Department
of State. She stated that she had assumed incorrectly that
he was working with the Department of State when he told her that
the State Department had told him in 1959 that he would be on his
own while in the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_A12-95" href="#Footnote_A12-95" class="fnanchor">A12-95</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The FBI tried to recruit Oswald. An FBI agent’s
name, telephone number, and automobile license number were found
among Oswald’s papers.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—FBI officials have testified that they had never
tried to recruit Oswald to act on behalf of the FBI in any capacity.
The Commission’s investigation corroborates this testimony. An FBI
agent, James P. Hosty, Jr., had given his name and telephone number
to Mrs. Ruth Paine so that she could call and give him Oswald’s
address in Dallas when she learned it. Mrs. Paine and Marina Oswald
have stated that Mrs. Paine gave Oswald a slip of paper with the
agent’s name and telephone number on it. Marina Oswald had taken
down the license number of Hosty’s car on one of his visits and given
it to her husband.<a id="FNanchor_A12-96" href="#Footnote_A12-96" class="fnanchor">A12-96</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Dallas police must have known where Oswald was
living in the city because Mrs. Paine had given the address of Oswald’s
room on North Beckley Avenue to the FBI some time before the
assassination.</p>

<p><i>Commission-finding.</i>—Mrs. Paine had never given the address of
Oswald’s roominghouse to the FBI, nor had she known the address
prior to the assassination. Therefore, the Dallas police could not have
learned the address from the FBI which did not know the address
before the assassination. The Dallas Police did not know that Oswald
was in the city before the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_A12-97" href="#Footnote_A12-97" class="fnanchor">A12-97</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—It has been FBI policy for 20 years to inform employers
of Communists or suspected Communists employed by them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_661">661</span>
It is a mystery, therefore, how Oswald retained his job at the Texas
School Book Depository.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The FBI advised the Commission that it has
never been its policy to inform employers that they have Communists
or suspected Communists working for them and that the FBI does
not disseminate internal security information to anyone outside the
executive branch of the U.S. Government. FBI agents had no contacts
with Texas School Book Depository officials until after the
assassination.<a id="FNanchor_A12-98" href="#Footnote_A12-98" class="fnanchor">A12-98</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Municipal and Federal police had observed Oswald
closely for some time but had not regarded him as a potential killer.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Dallas police had not been aware of
Oswald’s presence in the city before the assassination. The FBI knew
that Oswald was in Dallas from an interview with Mrs. Paine, but
no FBI agents had interviewed him there before the assassination.
The FBI had not regarded him as a potential killer.<a id="FNanchor_A12-99" href="#Footnote_A12-99" class="fnanchor">A12-99</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The FBI probably knew that Oswald had the rifle
before the President’s murder because it was most unlikely that it
could have traced the ownership of the rifle within 1 day if it had not
already had information on the rifle.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The FBI successfully traced the purchase of
the rifle by Oswald within 24 hours of the assassination. It had had
no previous information about the rifle.<a id="FNanchor_A12-100" href="#Footnote_A12-100" class="fnanchor">A12-100</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The FBI interviewed Oswald 10 days before the assassination.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The last FBI interview with Oswald, before
the assassination, took place in New Orleans in August 1963, when he
asked to see an FBI agent after his arrest by police for disturbing the
peace, the outcome of his distribution of Fair Play for Cuba handbills.
Neither Special Agent Hosty nor any other FBI agent saw or talked
with Oswald between his return to Dallas, on October 3, and November 22.
Hosty did interview Mrs. Paine at her home about Oswald
on November 1 and 5, 1963. He also saw Marina Oswald briefly on
November 1 at Mrs. Paine’s house, but he did not interview her.<a id="FNanchor_A12-101" href="#Footnote_A12-101" class="fnanchor">A12-101</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hdr240">CONSPIRATORIAL RELATIONSHIPS</h3>

<p>Rumors concerning accomplices and plots linked Oswald and Ruby
with each other, or with others, including Patrolman J. D. Tippit,
Gen. Edwin A. Walker, and Bernard Weissman of the nonexistent
American Factfinding Committee, in a conspiratorial relationship.
The Commission made intensive inquiry into the backgrounds and
relationships of Oswald and Ruby to determine whether they knew
each other or were involved in a plot of any kind with each other or
others. It was unable to find any credible evidence to support the
rumors linking Oswald and Ruby directly or through others. The
Commission concluded that they were not involved in a conspiratorial
relationship with each other or with any third parties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_662">662</span>
<i>Speculation.</i>—Lee Harvey Oswald, Jack Ruby, and Patrolman
J. D. Tippit lived within a few blocks of each other.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Oswald’s room was 1.3 miles from Ruby’s
apartment and Tippit lived 7 miles away from Ruby. Tippit’s residence
was about 7 miles from Oswald’s room.<a id="FNanchor_A12-102" href="#Footnote_A12-102" class="fnanchor">A12-102</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Since Oswald did not have the money to repay the
$435.61 he had received from the Department of State to cover part
of the expenses of his return from Russia, he must have received help
from some other source. Ruby lent Oswald money to pay back the
loan and lent him small amounts of money thereafter.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Commission has no credible evidence that
Oswald received any money from Ruby or anyone else to repay his
State Department loan, nor that he received small amounts of money
from Ruby at any time. An exhaustive analysis of Oswald’s income
and expenditures, made for the Commission by an Internal Revenue
Service expert, reveals that Oswald had sufficient funds to make the
State Department repayments from his earnings.<a id="FNanchor_A12-103" href="#Footnote_A12-103" class="fnanchor">A12-103</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Just before Oswald was shot by Ruby, he looked directly
at Ruby in apparent recognition of him.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Commission has been unable to establish
as a fact any kind of relationship between Ruby and Oswald other
than that Oswald was Ruby’s victim. The Commission has examined
television tapes and motion picture films of the shooting and has been
unable to discern any facial expression that could be interpreted to
signify recognition of Ruby or anyone else in the basement of the
building.<a id="FNanchor_A12-104" href="#Footnote_A12-104" class="fnanchor">A12-104</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The Dallas police suspected Oswald and Ruby of being
involved in an attack on General Walker and planned to arrest
the two when the FBI intervened, at the request of Attorney General
Robert F. Kennedy, and asked the police not to do so for reasons of
state.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—This allegation appeared in the November
29, 1963, issue (actually printed on November 25 or 26) of a German
weekly newspaper, Deutsche National Zeiting und Soldaten Zeitung,
published in Munich. The allegation later appeared in the National
Enquirer of May 17, 1964. The Commission has been reliably
informed that the statement was fabricated by an editor of the newspaper.
No evidence in support of this statement has ever been advanced
or uncovered. In their investigation of the attack on General
Walker, the Dallas police uncovered no suspects and planned no arrests.
The FBI had no knowledge that Oswald was responsible for
the attack until Marina Oswald revealed the information on December
3, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_A12-105" href="#Footnote_A12-105" class="fnanchor">A12-105</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Ruby and Oswald were seen together at the Carousel
Club.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—All assertions that Oswald was seen in the
company of Ruby or of anyone else at the Carousel Club have been
investigated. None of them merits any credence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_663">663</span><a id="FNanchor_A12-106" href="#Footnote_A12-106" class="fnanchor">A12-106</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald and General Walker were probably acquainted
with each other since Oswald’s notebook contained Walker’s
name and telephone number.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Although Oswald’s notebook contained
Walker’s name and telephone number there was no evidence that the
two knew each other. It is probable that this information was inserted
at the time that Oswald was planning his attack on Walker.
General Walker stated that he did not know of Oswald before the
assassination.<a id="FNanchor_A12-107" href="#Footnote_A12-107" class="fnanchor">A12-107</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Patrolman J.D. Tippit, Bernard Weissman, and Jack
Ruby met by prearrangement on November 14, 1963, at the Carousel
Club.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Investigation has revealed no evidence to support
this assertion. Nor is there credible evidence that any of the
three men knew each other.<a id="FNanchor_A12-108" href="#Footnote_A12-108" class="fnanchor">A12-108</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Ruby’s sister, Mrs. Eva Grant, said that Ruby and
Tippit were “like two brothers.”</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Mrs. Grant has denied ever making this statement
or any statement like it, saying it was untrue and without foundation.
Ruby was acquainted with another Dallas policeman named
Tippit, but this was G.M. Tippit of the special services bureau of the
department, not the Tippit who was killed.<a id="FNanchor_A12-109" href="#Footnote_A12-109" class="fnanchor">A12-109</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Jack Ruby was one of the most notorious of Dallas
gangsters.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—There is no credible evidence that Jack Ruby
was active in the criminal underworld. Investigation disclosed no
one in either Chicago or Dallas who had any knowledge that Ruby
was associated with organized criminal activity.<a id="FNanchor_A12-110" href="#Footnote_A12-110" class="fnanchor">A12-110</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The shooting in Dallas on January 23, 1964, of Warren
A. Reynolds, who witnessed the flight of Patrolman Tippit’s
slayer on November 22 and followed him for a short distance, may
have been connected in some way with the assassination of President
Kennedy and the slaying of Patrolman Tippit. A man arrested for
the attempt on Reynolds, Darrell Wayne Garner, was released as a
result, in part, of testimony by Betty (Nancy Jane Mooney) MacDonald,
who had allegedly worked at one time as a stripper at Jack
Ruby’s Carousel Club.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—This rumor, originally publicized by a newspaper
columnist on February 23, 1964, was apparently based on the
alleged connection between Betty MacDonald and the Carousel Club.
Investigation revealed no evidence that she had ever worked at the
Carousel Club. Employees of the club had no recollection that she
had ever worked there. Betty MacDonald was arrested and charged
with disturbing the peace on February 13, 1964. After being placed
in a cell at the Dallas city jail, she hanged herself. The Commission
has found no evidence that the shooting of Warren Reynolds was in
any way related to the assassination of President Kennedy or the murder
of Patrolman Tippit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_664">664</span><a id="FNanchor_A12-111" href="#Footnote_A12-111" class="fnanchor">A12-111</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr241">OTHER RUMORS AND SPECULATIONS</h3>

<p>Many rumors and speculations difficult to place in the categories
treated above also required consideration or investigation by the Commission.
In some way or other, much of this miscellany was related
to theories of conspiracy involving Oswald. The rest pertained to
peripheral aspects that were of sufficient import to merit attention.
The Commission’s findings are set forth below.</p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald was responsible in some way for the death
of Marine Pvt. Martin D. Schrand.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—This rumor was mentioned by at least one
of Oswald’s fellow Marines. Private Schrand was fatally wounded
by a discharge from a riot-type shotgun while he was on guard duty
on January 5, 1958, near the carrier pier, U.S. Naval Air Station,
Cubi Point, Republic of the Philippines. The official Marine investigation
in 1958 found that Schrand’s death was the result of an accidental
discharge of his gun and that no other person or persons were
involved in the incident. The rumor that Oswald was involved in
Schrand’s death in some way may have had its origin in two circumstances:
(1) Oswald was stationed at Cubi Point at the time of
Schrand’s death; (2) on October 27, 1957, while stationed in Japan,
Oswald accidentally shot himself in the left elbow with a .22 derringer
that he owned. The Commission has found no evidence that Oswald
had any connection with the fatal shooting of Private Schrand.<a id="FNanchor_A12-112" href="#Footnote_A12-112" class="fnanchor">A12-112</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The Texas School Book Depository is owned and
operated by the city of Dallas, and Oswald was therefore a municipal
employee. Accordingly, he could have secured his job at the Depository
only if someone in an official capacity vouched for him.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Texas School Book Depository is a private
corporation unconnected with the city of Dallas. Oswald therefore
was not a municipal employee. He obtained his position at the
Depository with the assistance of Mrs. Ruth Paine, who learned of
a possible opening from a neighbor and arranged an interview for
him with Superintendent Roy S. Truly at the Depository.<a id="FNanchor_A12-113" href="#Footnote_A12-113" class="fnanchor">A12-113</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Prior to the assassination Dallas police searched
other buildings in the area of the Texas School Book Depository but
not the School Book Depository itself.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Dallas police and the Secret Service both
notified the Commission that, other than the Trade Mart, they had
searched no buildings along the route of the President’s motorcade
or elsewhere in Dallas in connection with the President’s visit. It
was not Secret Service practice to search buildings along the routes
of motorcades.<a id="FNanchor_A12-114" href="#Footnote_A12-114" class="fnanchor">A12-114</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Sheriff E. J. Decker of Dallas County came on the
police radio at 12:25 p.m. with orders to calm trouble at the Texas
School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Commission finding.—The final edition of the Dallas Times-Herald
of November 22 (p. 1, col. 1) reported that “Sheriff Decker came on the
air at 12:25 p.m.” and stated: “‘I don’t know what’s happened. Take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_665">665</span>
every available man from the jail and the office and go to the railroad
yards off Elm near the triple underpass.’” The article in the Times-Herald
did not mention the time that the President was shot. The
radio log of the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office shows that Sheriff
Decker came on the air at 40 seconds after 12:30 p.m. and stated:
“Stand by me. All units and officers vicinity of station report to the
railroad track area, just north of Elm—Report to the railroad track
area, just north of Elm.” The radio log does not show any messages
by Sheriff Decker between 12:20 p.m. and 40 seconds after 12:30 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_A12-115" href="#Footnote_A12-115" class="fnanchor">A12-115</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Police precautions in Dallas on November 22 included
surveillance of many people, among them some who did no more than
speak in favor of school integration.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Dallas Police Department notified the
Commission that on November 22 it had no one under surveillance as
a precaution in connection with President Kennedy’s visit except at
the Trade Mart. The Commission received no evidence that the Dallas
police had under surveillance people who spoke in favor of school
integration.<a id="FNanchor_A12-116" href="#Footnote_A12-116" class="fnanchor">A12-116</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald was seen at shooting ranges in the Dallas area
practicing firing with a rifle.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Marina Oswald stated that on one occasion
in March or April 1963, her husband told her that he was going to
practice firing with the rifle. Witnesses have testified that they saw
Oswald at shooting ranges in the Dallas area during October and
November 1963. Investigation has failed to confirm that the man seen
by these witnesses was Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A12-117" href="#Footnote_A12-117" class="fnanchor">A12-117</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald could drive a car and was seen in cars at
various places.</p>

<p><i>Commission-finding.</i>—Oswald did not have a driver’s license.
Marina Oswald and Ruth Paine have testified that he could not drive
a car, and there is no confirmed evidence to establish his presence at
any location as the driver of a car. Mrs. Paine did give Oswald
some driving lessons and he did drive short distances on these
occasions.<a id="FNanchor_A12-118" href="#Footnote_A12-118" class="fnanchor">A12-118</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald received money by Western Union telegraph
from time to time for several months before the assassination of
President Kennedy.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—An employee in the Western Union main office
in Dallas, C. A. Hamblen, made statements that he remembered seeing
Oswald there on some occasions collecting money that had been telegraphed
to him. In his testimony before the Commission, Hamblen
was unable to state whether or not the person he had seen was Lee Harvey
Oswald. Western Union officials searched their records in Dallas
and other cities for the period from June through November 1963 but
found no money orders payable to Lee Oswald or to any of his known
aliases. A Western Union official concluded that the allegation was “a
figment of Mr. Hamblen’s imagination.”<a id="FNanchor_A12-119" href="#Footnote_A12-119" class="fnanchor">A12-119</a> The Commission has
found no evidence to contradict this conclusion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_666">666</span><a id="FNanchor_A12-120" href="#Footnote_A12-120" class="fnanchor">A12-120</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—On his way back from Mexico City in October 1963,
Oswald stopped in Alice, Tex., to apply for a job at the local radio
station.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—This rumor apparently originated with the
manager of radio station KOPY, Alice, who stated that Oswald visited
his office on the afternoon of October 4 for about 25 minutes. According
to the manager, Oswald was driving a battered 1953 model car
and had his wife and a small child in the car with him. Oswald
traveled from Mexico City to Dallas by bus, arriving in Dallas on
the afternoon of October 3. The bus did not pass through Alice. On
October 4, Oswald applied for two jobs in Dallas and then spent the
afternoon and night with his wife and child at the Paine residence
in Irving. Investigation has revealed that Oswald did not own a car
and there is no convincing evidence that he could drive a car. Accordingly,
Oswald could not have been in Alice on October 4. There is no
evidence that he stopped in Alice to look for a job on any occasion.<a id="FNanchor_A12-121" href="#Footnote_A12-121" class="fnanchor">A12-121</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald or accomplices had made arrangements for
his getaway by airplane from an airfield in the Dallas area.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Investigation of such claims revealed that
they had not the slightest substance. The Commission found no evidence
that Oswald had any prearranged plan for escape after the
assassination.<a id="FNanchor_A12-122" href="#Footnote_A12-122" class="fnanchor">A12-122</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—One hundred and fifty dollars was found in the
dresser of Oswald’s room at 1026 North Beckley Avenue after the
assassination.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—No money was found in Oswald’s room after
the assassination. Oswald left $170 in the room occupied by his wife
at the Paine residence in Irving. At the time of his arrest Oswald had
$13.87 on his person.<a id="FNanchor_A12-123" href="#Footnote_A12-123" class="fnanchor">A12-123</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—After Oswald’s arrest, the police found in his room
seven metal file boxes filled with the names of Castro sympathizers.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—The Dallas police inventories of Oswald’s
property taken from his room at 1026 North Beckley Avenue do not
include any file boxes. A number of small file boxes listed in the inventory
as having been taken from the Paine residence in Irving contained
letters, pictures, books and literature, most of which belonged
to Ruth Paine, not to Oswald. No lists of names of Castro sympathizers
were found among these effects.<a id="FNanchor_A12-124" href="#Footnote_A12-124" class="fnanchor">A12-124</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Oswald’s letters vary so greatly in quality (spelling,
grammar, sentence structure) that he must have had help in preparing
the better constructed letters or someone else wrote them for
him.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—There is no evidence that anyone in the United
States helped Oswald with his better written letters or that anyone
else wrote his letters for him. His wife stated that he would write
many drafts of his more important letters. His mother indicated that
he would work hard over the drafts of some of his letters. It is
clear that he did take greater pains with some of his letters than with
others and that the contrasts in quality were accordingly substantial.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_667">667</span>
It is also clear that even his better written letters contained some distinctive
elements of spelling, grammar, and punctuation that were
common to his poorer efforts. Oswald wrote in his diary that he
received help from his Intourist Guide, Rima Shirokova, in the
preparation of his letter of October 16, 1959, to the Supreme Soviet.<a id="FNanchor_A12-125" href="#Footnote_A12-125" class="fnanchor">A12-125</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—A Negro janitor who was a witness to the shooting and
was supposed to be able to identify Oswald as the killer was held in
protective custody by the Dallas police until he could appear before
the President’s Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Investigation revealed that this story had no
foundation in fact. No such witness was kept in protective custody by
the Dallas police for appearance before the Commission. The story
had its origin in a newspaper account based on hearsay.<a id="FNanchor_A12-126" href="#Footnote_A12-126" class="fnanchor">A12-126</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The Secret Service incarcerated Marina Oswald
immediately after the assassination.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Marina Oswald was given protection by the
Secret Service for a period of time after the assassination. She had
freedom to communicate with others at anytime she desired, to go
where she pleased, or to terminate the protection at any time.<a id="FNanchor_A12-127" href="#Footnote_A12-127" class="fnanchor">A12-127</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—Mrs. Marguerite Oswald was shown a photograph of
Jack Ruby by an FBI agent the night before Ruby killed her son.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—On the night of November 23, 1963, Special
Agent Bardwell D. Odum of the FBI showed Mrs. Marguerite Oswald
a picture of a man to determine whether the man was known to her.
Mrs. Oswald stated subsequently that the picture was of Jack Ruby.
The Commission has examined a copy of the photograph and determined
that it was not a picture of Jack Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_A12-128" href="#Footnote_A12-128" class="fnanchor">A12-128</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The son of the only witness to the Tippit slaying
was arrested after talking to some private investigators and soon
plunged to his death from an unbarred jail window.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—According to Mrs. Helen Markham, one of
the witnesses to the Tippit slaying, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald and two
men who claimed to be reporters from Philadelphia sought to interview
her on June 27, 1964. Mrs. Markham did not wish to be interviewed
and put them off. Afterward, Mrs. Markham’s son, William
Edward Markham, talked with Mrs. Oswald and the men about the
Oswald matter and the shooting of Patrolman Tippit. William Edward
Markham had been in Norfolk, Va., at the time of the assassination
and had not returned to Dallas until May 7, 1964. He had no
personal knowledge of the shooting of Patrolman Tippit. On June
30, 1964, another of Mrs. Markham’s sons, James Alfred Markham,
was arrested at Mrs. Markham’s apartment by Dallas Police on a
charge of burglary. While trying to escape, he fell from the bathroom
of the apartment to a concrete driveway about 20 feet below. He was
taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital, treated for injuries, and after
6½ hours was taken to jail. As of July 31, 1964, he was in Dallas
County Jail awaiting trial. There was also a warrant outstanding
against him for parole violation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_668">668</span><a id="FNanchor_A12-129" href="#Footnote_A12-129" class="fnanchor">A12-129</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The headquarters detachment of the U.S. Army, under
orders from [Secretary of Defense Robert S.] McNamara’s office,
began to rehearse for the funeral more than a week before the assassination.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—This assertion is based on an interview with
U.S. Army Capt. Richard C. Cloy that appeared in the Jackson, Miss.,
Clarion-Ledger of February 21, 1964. The newspaper quotes Captain
Cloy, who was a member of the Army unit charged with conducting
funeral ceremonials in honor of deceased Chiefs of State, as having
said that, “we were in a state of readiness and had just finished a
funeral rehearsal because there was grave concern for President
Hoover’s health. But we never expected that our practice was preparing
us for President Kennedy.”<a id="FNanchor_A12-130" href="#Footnote_A12-130" class="fnanchor">A12-130</a></p>

<p><i>Speculation.</i>—The ship in which Oswald went to Europe in 1959
stopped in Havana on the way.</p>

<p><i>Commission finding.</i>—Oswald boarded the SS <i>Marion Lykes</i> in
New Orleans and it sailed on September 20, 1959. It docked in Le
Havre, France, on October 8 with only one previous stop—at another
French port, La Pallice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_669">669</span><a id="FNanchor_A12-131" href="#Footnote_A12-131" class="fnanchor">A12-131</a></p>

</div>

<h3 id="hdr243">EARLY YEARS</h3>

<p>Marguerite Claverie, the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald, was born
in New Orleans in 1907,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1" href="#Footnote_A13-1" class="fnanchor">A13-1</a> into a family of French and German extraction.<a id="FNanchor_A13-2" href="#Footnote_A13-2" class="fnanchor">A13-2</a>
Her mother died a few years after Marguerite was born,
leaving her and five other young children in the care of their father,
a streetcar conductor.<a id="FNanchor_A13-3" href="#Footnote_A13-3" class="fnanchor">A13-3</a> Although Marguerite describes herself as “a
child of one parent,” she recalls being “one of the most popular young
ladies in the [grammar] school,” and thinks of her childhood as a
“very full happy” one.<a id="FNanchor_A13-4" href="#Footnote_A13-4" class="fnanchor">A13-4</a> Her older sister, Mrs. Lillian Murret, remembers
Marguerite as “a very pretty child, a very beautiful girl,”<a id="FNanchor_A13-5" href="#Footnote_A13-5" class="fnanchor">A13-5</a> as does
a former acquaintance, Clem H. Sehrt, who knew the Claveries.<a id="FNanchor_A13-6" href="#Footnote_A13-6" class="fnanchor">A13-6</a> The
family was poor but, according to Mrs. Murret, was a “happy family
* * * singing all the time.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-7" href="#Footnote_A13-7" class="fnanchor">A13-7</a> Marguerite had 1 year of high
school.<a id="FNanchor_A13-8" href="#Footnote_A13-8" class="fnanchor">A13-8</a> Shortly before she was 17, she went to work as a receptionist
for a law firm in New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_A13-9" href="#Footnote_A13-9" class="fnanchor">A13-9</a></p>

<p>In August 1929, while she was still working at the law firm, Marguerite
married Edward John Pic, Jr.,<a id="FNanchor_A13-10" href="#Footnote_A13-10" class="fnanchor">A13-10</a> a quiet man of her own age,
who worked as a clerk for T. Smith &amp; Son, a New Orleans stevedoring
company.<a id="FNanchor_A13-11" href="#Footnote_A13-11" class="fnanchor">A13-11</a> The marriage was not a success, and by the summer of
1931 she and Pic were separated.<a id="FNanchor_A13-12" href="#Footnote_A13-12" class="fnanchor">A13-12</a> Marguerite was then 3 months
pregnant; she told her family that Pic did not want any children
and refused to support her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-13" href="#Footnote_A13-13" class="fnanchor">A13-13</a> Pic ascribed the separation simply to
their inability to get along together.<a id="FNanchor_A13-14" href="#Footnote_A13-14" class="fnanchor">A13-14</a> A boy was born on January 17,
1932, whom Marguerite named John Edward Pic.<a id="FNanchor_A13-15" href="#Footnote_A13-15" class="fnanchor">A13-15</a> Pic saw his son
occasionally until he was about 1 year old; after that, he did not see
the boy again<a id="FNanchor_A13-16" href="#Footnote_A13-16" class="fnanchor">A13-16</a> but contributed to his support until he was 18 years
old.<a id="FNanchor_A13-17" href="#Footnote_A13-17" class="fnanchor">A13-17</a></p>

<p>During her separation from her first husband, Marguerite saw a
great deal of Robert Edward Lee Oswald, an insurance premium
collector,<a id="FNanchor_A13-18" href="#Footnote_A13-18" class="fnanchor">A13-18</a> who also was married but was separated from his wife.<a id="FNanchor_A13-19" href="#Footnote_A13-19" class="fnanchor">A13-19</a>
In 1933, Marguerite was divorced from Pic<a id="FNanchor_A13-20" href="#Footnote_A13-20" class="fnanchor">A13-20</a> and, Oswald’s wife
also having obtained a divorce,<a id="FNanchor_A13-21" href="#Footnote_A13-21" class="fnanchor">A13-21</a> they were married in a Lutheran
church on July 20.<a id="FNanchor_A13-22" href="#Footnote_A13-22" class="fnanchor">A13-22</a> Marguerite has described the period of her marriage
to Oswald as “the only happy part” of her life.<a id="FNanchor_A13-23" href="#Footnote_A13-23" class="fnanchor">A13-23</a> A son was born
on April 7, 1934, who was named for his father;<a id="FNanchor_A13-24" href="#Footnote_A13-24" class="fnanchor">A13-24</a> Oswald wanted to
adopt John Pic, but his mother objected on the ground that John’s
father might cut off the support payments.<a id="FNanchor_A13-25" href="#Footnote_A13-25" class="fnanchor">A13-25</a> In 1938, the Oswalds
purchased a new house on Alvar Street for $3,900,<a id="FNanchor_A13-26" href="#Footnote_A13-26" class="fnanchor">A13-26</a> in what John
remembered as “a rather nice neighborhood.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-27" href="#Footnote_A13-27" class="fnanchor">A13-27</a> The house was across
the street from the William Frantz School,<a id="FNanchor_A13-28" href="#Footnote_A13-28" class="fnanchor">A13-28</a> which first John and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_670">670</span>
later both he and Robert, Jr., attended.<a id="FNanchor_A13-29" href="#Footnote_A13-29" class="fnanchor">A13-29</a> On August 19, 1939, little
more than a year after the Oswalds bought the Alvar Street house,
Robert Oswald died suddenly of a heart attack.<a id="FNanchor_A13-30" href="#Footnote_A13-30" class="fnanchor">A13-30</a></p>

<p>Two months later, on October 18, 1939, a second son was born.<a id="FNanchor_A13-31" href="#Footnote_A13-31" class="fnanchor">A13-31</a>
He was named Lee after his father; Harvey was his paternal grandmother’s
maiden name.<a id="FNanchor_A13-32" href="#Footnote_A13-32" class="fnanchor">A13-32</a> For a while after her husband’s death, Mrs.
Oswald remained in the Alvar Street house without working; she
probably lived on life insurance proceeds.<a id="FNanchor_A13-33" href="#Footnote_A13-33" class="fnanchor">A13-33</a> Sometime in 1940, she
rented the house to Dr. Bruno F. Mancuso, the doctor who had delivered
Lee.<a id="FNanchor_A13-34" href="#Footnote_A13-34" class="fnanchor">A13-34</a> (Dr. Mancuso continued to rent the house until 1944,<a id="FNanchor_A13-35" href="#Footnote_A13-35" class="fnanchor">A13-35</a>
when Marguerite obtained a judgment of possession against him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-36" href="#Footnote_A13-36" class="fnanchor">A13-36</a>
She sold the house for $6,500 to the First Homestead and Savings
Association, which resold it to Dr. Mancuso.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-37" href="#Footnote_A13-37" class="fnanchor">A13-37</a> She herself moved to
a rented house at 1242 Congress Street, where she lived for about half
a year.<a id="FNanchor_A13-38" href="#Footnote_A13-38" class="fnanchor">A13-38</a> For part of this period after Oswald’s death, the two older
boys were placed in the Infant Jesus College, a Catholic boarding
school in Algiers, La., a suburb of New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_A13-39" href="#Footnote_A13-39" class="fnanchor">A13-39</a> Neither they nor
their mother liked this arrangement,<a id="FNanchor_A13-40" href="#Footnote_A13-40" class="fnanchor">A13-40</a> which John thought was intended
to save money;<a id="FNanchor_A13-41" href="#Footnote_A13-41" class="fnanchor">A13-41</a> it lasted for less than a year, after which
the boys returned to the school Frantz and then transferred to the
George Washington Elementary School.<a id="FNanchor_A13-42" href="#Footnote_A13-42" class="fnanchor">A13-42</a></p>

<p>On March 5, 1941, Mrs. Oswald purchased a frame<a id="FNanchor_A13-43" href="#Footnote_A13-43" class="fnanchor">A13-43</a> house at 1010
Bartholomew Street, for $1,300.<a id="FNanchor_A13-44" href="#Footnote_A13-44" class="fnanchor">A13-44</a> According to John’s recollection,
the neighborhood was not as pleasant as Alvar Street; the house had
a backyard, and the family kept a dog named “Sunshine.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-45" href="#Footnote_A13-45" class="fnanchor">A13-45</a> A neighbor,
Mrs. Viola Peterman, recalls that Mrs. Oswald kept to herself
but appeared to be “a good mother to her children.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-46" href="#Footnote_A13-46" class="fnanchor">A13-46</a> She opened
a shop in the front room, where she sold things like sewing supplies
and small groceries.<a id="FNanchor_A13-47" href="#Footnote_A13-47" class="fnanchor">A13-47</a> Oswald’s Notion Shop, as it was called,<a id="FNanchor_A13-48" href="#Footnote_A13-48" class="fnanchor">A13-48</a>
failed to make money,<a id="FNanchor_A13-49" href="#Footnote_A13-49" class="fnanchor">A13-49</a> and on January 16, 1942, Mrs. Oswald sold
the house back to the Third District Home Association, from which
she had purchased it, for a profit of $800.<a id="FNanchor_A13-50" href="#Footnote_A13-50" class="fnanchor">A13-50</a></p>

<p>Probably in contemplation of the sale of the house, Mrs. Oswald
applied in December 1941 to the Evangelical Lutheran Bethlehem
Orphan Asylum Association for the admission of her two older sons
to the orphan asylum, known as the Bethlehem Children’s Home;
she stated on the application that she could contribute $20 per month
to their maintenance and would supply shoes and clothing.<a id="FNanchor_A13-51" href="#Footnote_A13-51" class="fnanchor">A13-51</a> She had
inquired also about Lee, who was too young to be admitted.<a id="FNanchor_A13-52" href="#Footnote_A13-52" class="fnanchor">A13-52</a> John
and Robert were accepted and entered the home on January 3, 1942.<a id="FNanchor_A13-53" href="#Footnote_A13-53" class="fnanchor">A13-53</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Oswald moved to an apartment at 831 Pauline Street,<a id="FNanchor_A13-54" href="#Footnote_A13-54" class="fnanchor">A13-54</a> and
returned to work. In December 1942, she listed her occupation as
“telephone operator”;<a id="FNanchor_A13-55" href="#Footnote_A13-55" class="fnanchor">A13-55</a> this may be the job she held at the Pittsburgh
Plate Glass Co., a company for which she worked at some point during
this period.<a id="FNanchor_A13-56" href="#Footnote_A13-56" class="fnanchor">A13-56</a> She left Lee for much of this time with his aunt, Mrs.
Murret, who thought him a good looking, friendly child, but could
not devote a great deal of attention to him because she had five children
of her own.<a id="FNanchor_A13-57" href="#Footnote_A13-57" class="fnanchor">A13-57</a> In the late spring of 1942, Lee was watched for several
weeks by Mrs. Thomas Roach, who lived with her husband in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_671">671</span>
same house as the Oswalds.<a id="FNanchor_A13-58" href="#Footnote_A13-58" class="fnanchor">A13-58</a> Lee evidently did not get along with
Mrs. Roach who told the next occupant of the house that Lee was a
bad, unmanageable child who threw his toy gun at her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-59" href="#Footnote_A13-59" class="fnanchor">A13-59</a> Apparently
referring to the Roaches, Mrs. Oswald testified that she had once
hired a couple to care for Lee; the couple neglected him, so she “put
them out” and cared for Lee herself until Mrs. Murret was able to
help her again.<a id="FNanchor_A13-60" href="#Footnote_A13-60" class="fnanchor">A13-60</a> Soon after the incident with the Roaches, Mrs.
Oswald moved again,<a id="FNanchor_A13-61" href="#Footnote_A13-61" class="fnanchor">A13-61</a> this time to 111 Sherwood Forest Drive, near
the Murrets.<a id="FNanchor_A13-62" href="#Footnote_A13-62" class="fnanchor">A13-62</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Murret took care of Lee for several months longer. Near Lee’s
third birthday, Mrs. Oswald again inquired about his admission into
the Bethlehem Children’s Home,<a id="FNanchor_A13-63" href="#Footnote_A13-63" class="fnanchor">A13-63</a> perhaps because a disagreement
with her sister made it impossible to leave him with her any longer.<a id="FNanchor_A13-64" href="#Footnote_A13-64" class="fnanchor">A13-64</a>
He was admitted on December 26.<a id="FNanchor_A13-65" href="#Footnote_A13-65" class="fnanchor">A13-65</a> On his application, Mrs. Oswald
agreed to contribute $10 per month and to supply shoes and clothing,
as for the other boys.<a id="FNanchor_A13-66" href="#Footnote_A13-66" class="fnanchor">A13-66</a></p>

<p>Lee remained in the home for about 13 months, but according to
John’s testimony, left on several occasions to spend short periods of
time with his mother or the Murrets.<a id="FNanchor_A13-67" href="#Footnote_A13-67" class="fnanchor">A13-67</a> John and Robert have pleasant
memories of the home,<a id="FNanchor_A13-68" href="#Footnote_A13-68" class="fnanchor">A13-68</a> which apparently gave the children a good
deal of freedom.<a id="FNanchor_A13-69" href="#Footnote_A13-69" class="fnanchor">A13-69</a> Robert described it as nondenominational but
having “a Christian atmosphere”; “it might have been just a Protestant
home.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-70" href="#Footnote_A13-70" class="fnanchor">A13-70</a> Mrs. Oswald visited them regularly,<a id="FNanchor_A13-71" href="#Footnote_A13-71" class="fnanchor">A13-71</a> and they occasionally
left the home to visit her or the Murrets.<a id="FNanchor_A13-72" href="#Footnote_A13-72" class="fnanchor">A13-72</a></p>

<p>In July 1943, Mrs. Oswald was hired to manage a small hosiery
store.<a id="FNanchor_A13-73" href="#Footnote_A13-73" class="fnanchor">A13-73</a> This is probably the store to which she referred in her testimony
as the “Princess Hosiery Shop on Canal Street,” at which, she
testified, she was left by herself and “in 6 days’ time * * * hired four
girls.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-74" href="#Footnote_A13-74" class="fnanchor">A13-74</a> Her employer remembers her as a neat, attractive, and
hardworking woman, an aggressive person who would make a good
manager.<a id="FNanchor_A13-75" href="#Footnote_A13-75" class="fnanchor">A13-75</a> She was not good with figures, however, and after several
months he discharged her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-76" href="#Footnote_A13-76" class="fnanchor">A13-76</a> At about this same time, she met Edwin
A. Ekdahl, an electrical engineer older than herself, who was originally
from Boston but was then working in the area.<a id="FNanchor_A13-77" href="#Footnote_A13-77" class="fnanchor">A13-77</a> They saw
each other often. Ekdahl met the boys<a id="FNanchor_A13-78" href="#Footnote_A13-78" class="fnanchor">A13-78</a> and, according to John’s
testimony, on at least one occasion, they all spent a weekend at a
summer resort area in Covington, La.<a id="FNanchor_A13-79" href="#Footnote_A13-79" class="fnanchor">A13-79</a></p>

<p>By January 1944, Mrs. Oswald and Ekdahl had decided to marry.<a id="FNanchor_A13-80" href="#Footnote_A13-80" class="fnanchor">A13-80</a>
She withdrew Lee from the Children’s Home<a id="FNanchor_A13-81" href="#Footnote_A13-81" class="fnanchor">A13-81</a> and moved with him
to Dallas, where Ekdahl expected to be located.<a id="FNanchor_A13-82" href="#Footnote_A13-82" class="fnanchor">A13-82</a> They planned to
postpone the marriage until the end of the school year so that the
older boys could complete the year at the home before they left it.<a id="FNanchor_A13-83" href="#Footnote_A13-83" class="fnanchor">A13-83</a>
In the meantime, she would care for Ekdahl,<a id="FNanchor_A13-84" href="#Footnote_A13-84" class="fnanchor">A13-84</a> who was recovering
from a serious illness, probably a heart attack.<a id="FNanchor_A13-85" href="#Footnote_A13-85" class="fnanchor">A13-85</a> Mrs. Oswald has
testified that when she arrived in Dallas, she decided that she did
not want to marry Ekdahl after all.<a id="FNanchor_A13-86" href="#Footnote_A13-86" class="fnanchor">A13-86</a> Using part of the proceeds
from the sale of the Alvar Street house,<a id="FNanchor_A13-87" href="#Footnote_A13-87" class="fnanchor">A13-87</a> she purchased a house at
4801 Victor Street,<a id="FNanchor_A13-88" href="#Footnote_A13-88" class="fnanchor">A13-88</a> a portion of which she rented.<a id="FNanchor_A13-89" href="#Footnote_A13-89" class="fnanchor">A13-89</a> In June, John
and Robert left the Children’s Home and joined their mother in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_672">672</span>
Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-90" href="#Footnote_A13-90" class="fnanchor">A13-90</a> They entered the nearby Davy Crockett Elementary School
the following September.<a id="FNanchor_A13-91" href="#Footnote_A13-91" class="fnanchor">A13-91</a></p>

<p>Ekdahl visited Mrs. Oswald on weekends and stayed at Victor
Street.<a id="FNanchor_A13-92" href="#Footnote_A13-92" class="fnanchor">A13-92</a> By the following year she had resolved her doubts about
marrying him, influenced in part by his substantial income<a id="FNanchor_A13-93" href="#Footnote_A13-93" class="fnanchor">A13-93</a> and
perhaps by the visit some time earlier of his sister, who favored the
marriage because of his ill health.<a id="FNanchor_A13-94" href="#Footnote_A13-94" class="fnanchor">A13-94</a> Explaining that she expected to
travel a great deal, Mrs. Oswald tried unsuccessfully to return the
older boys to the home in February 1945.<a id="FNanchor_A13-95" href="#Footnote_A13-95" class="fnanchor">A13-95</a> She and Ekdahl were
married in May.<a id="FNanchor_A13-96" href="#Footnote_A13-96" class="fnanchor">A13-96</a> After a brief honeymoon, they returned to Victor
Street.<a id="FNanchor_A13-97" href="#Footnote_A13-97" class="fnanchor">A13-97</a></p>

<p>Ekdahl got along well with the boys, on whom he lavished much
attention.<a id="FNanchor_A13-98" href="#Footnote_A13-98" class="fnanchor">A13-98</a> John testified that Ekdahl treated them as if they were
his own children and that Lee seemed to find in Ekdahl “the father
he never had”; John recalled that on one occasion he told Lee that
Ekdahl and his mother had become reconciled after a separation, and
that “this seemed to really elate Lee, this made him really happy that
they were getting back together.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-99" href="#Footnote_A13-99" class="fnanchor">A13-99</a></p>

<p>Because Ekdahl’s business required him to make frequent trips,
in September, John and Robert were placed in the Chamberlain-Hunt
Military Academy at Port Gibson, Miss.;<a id="FNanchor_A13-100" href="#Footnote_A13-100" class="fnanchor">A13-100</a> their mother paid the
tuition herself, using the proceeds from the sale of the Alvar Street
property.<a id="FNanchor_A13-101" href="#Footnote_A13-101" class="fnanchor">A13-101</a> They remained at the academy for the next 3 years,
returning home only for vacations.<a id="FNanchor_A13-102" href="#Footnote_A13-102" class="fnanchor">A13-102</a> Lee accompanied his parents
on their travels.<a id="FNanchor_A13-103" href="#Footnote_A13-103" class="fnanchor">A13-103</a> Mrs. Myrtle Evans, who had known both Marguerite
and Ekdahl before their marriage,<a id="FNanchor_A13-104" href="#Footnote_A13-104" class="fnanchor">A13-104</a> testified that Marguerite
insisted on keeping Lee with her; Mrs. Evans thought that Marguerite
was “too close” to Lee and “spoiled him to death,” which hurt her
marriage to Ekdahl.<a id="FNanchor_A13-105" href="#Footnote_A13-105" class="fnanchor">A13-105</a></p>

<p>Sometime in the fall after John and Robert were at boarding school,
the Ekdahls moved to Benbrook, a suburb of Fort Worth, where they
lived on Granbury Road,<a id="FNanchor_A13-106" href="#Footnote_A13-106" class="fnanchor">A13-106</a> in a house of stone or brick, set on a large
plot of land.<a id="FNanchor_A13-107" href="#Footnote_A13-107" class="fnanchor">A13-107</a> Records of the Benbrook Common School show Lee’s
admission into the first grade on October 31; his birth date is incorrectly
given as July 9, 1939, his mother presumably having given that
date to satisfy the age requirement.<a id="FNanchor_A13-108" href="#Footnote_A13-108" class="fnanchor">A13-108</a> On February 8, 1946, he was
admitted to the Harris Hospital in Fort Worth with “acute mastoiditis.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-109" href="#Footnote_A13-109" class="fnanchor">A13-109</a>
A mastoidectomy was performed without complications, and
Lee left the hospital in 4 days.<a id="FNanchor_A13-110" href="#Footnote_A13-110" class="fnanchor">A13-110</a> (In 1955, Lee indicated on a school
form that he had an “abnormal ear drum in left ear,”<a id="FNanchor_A13-111" href="#Footnote_A13-111" class="fnanchor">A13-111</a> presumably
a reference to the mastoidectomy; but when he entered the Marines 1
year later, physical examination disclosed no physical defects.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-112" href="#Footnote_A13-112" class="fnanchor">A13-112</a></p>

<p>The Ekdahls’ marriage quickly broke down. Before they had been
married a year, Marguerite suspected Ekdahl of infidelity.<a id="FNanchor_A13-113" href="#Footnote_A13-113" class="fnanchor">A13-113</a> She
thought him stingy,<a id="FNanchor_A13-114" href="#Footnote_A13-114" class="fnanchor">A13-114</a> and there were frequent arguments about his
insistence that she account for her expenditures and his refusal to
share his money with her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-115" href="#Footnote_A13-115" class="fnanchor">A13-115</a> In the summer of 1946, she left Ekdahl,
picked up John and Robert at Chamberlain-Hunt, and moved with the
boys to Covington, La.,<a id="FNanchor_A13-116" href="#Footnote_A13-116" class="fnanchor">A13-116</a> where they lived for at least part of the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_673">673</span>
at 311 Vermont Street. <a id="FNanchor_A13-117" href="#Footnote_A13-117" class="fnanchor">A13-117</a> Mrs. Evans described them at Covington,
possibly during this summer, as “really a happy family”; Lee seemed
like a normal boy but “kept to himself” and seemed not “to want to be
with any other children.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-118" href="#Footnote_A13-118" class="fnanchor">A13-118</a> The separation continued after the two
boys returned to boarding school, and in September Lee was enrolled
in the Covington Elementary School.<a id="FNanchor_A13-119" href="#Footnote_A13-119" class="fnanchor">A13-119</a> His record at Benbrook had
been satisfactory—he was present on 82 school days and absent on 15,
and received all A’s and B’s<a id="FNanchor_A13-120" href="#Footnote_A13-120" class="fnanchor">A13-120</a>—but he had not completed the work of
the first grade, in which he was enrolled for a second time.<a id="FNanchor_A13-121" href="#Footnote_A13-121" class="fnanchor">A13-121</a></p>

<p>Lee received no grades at the Covington School, from which he
was withdrawn on January 23, 1947,<a id="FNanchor_A13-122" href="#Footnote_A13-122" class="fnanchor">A13-122</a> because his parents, now reconciled,
were moving to Fort Worth, where they lived at 1505 Eighth
Avenue.<a id="FNanchor_A13-123" href="#Footnote_A13-123" class="fnanchor">A13-123</a> Four days later, he enrolled in the Clayton Public School;
he was still in the first grade, which he completed in May with B’s in
every subject except physical education and health, in which he received
A’s.<a id="FNanchor_A13-124" href="#Footnote_A13-124" class="fnanchor">A13-124</a> In the fall, he entered the second grade in the same
school but, relations between his parents having deteriorated again,
was withdrawn before any grades were recorded.<a id="FNanchor_A13-125" href="#Footnote_A13-125" class="fnanchor">A13-125</a></p>

<p>After the move to Fort Worth, the Ekdahls continued to argue
frequently; according to John, “they would have a fight about every
other day and he would leave and come back.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-126" href="#Footnote_A13-126" class="fnanchor">A13-126</a> That summer,
Marguerite obtained what she regarded as proof that Ekdahl was
having some sort of affair. According to her testimony, a neighbor
told her that Ekdahl had been living on Eighth Avenue with another
woman while she was in Covington.<a id="FNanchor_A13-127" href="#Footnote_A13-127" class="fnanchor">A13-127</a> Then, at a time when Ekdahl
was supposed to be out of town,<a id="FNanchor_A13-128" href="#Footnote_A13-128" class="fnanchor">A13-128</a> she went with John and several of
his friends to an apartment in Fort Worth; one of the boys posed as a
telegram carrier, and when the door opened she pushed her way into
the apartment and found Ekdahl in his shirt sleeves in the company
of a woman in a negligee.<a id="FNanchor_A13-129" href="#Footnote_A13-129" class="fnanchor">A13-129</a></p>

<p>Despite this apparent confirmation of her suspicions, Marguerite
continued to live with Ekdahl until January 1948.<a id="FNanchor_A13-130" href="#Footnote_A13-130" class="fnanchor">A13-130</a> In January,
according to Ekdahl’s allegations in the subsequent divorce proceedings,
she “directed * * * [him] to leave the home immediately and
never to return,” which he did.<a id="FNanchor_A13-131" href="#Footnote_A13-131" class="fnanchor">A13-131</a> Ekdahl filed suit for divorce in
March.<a id="FNanchor_A13-132" href="#Footnote_A13-132" class="fnanchor">A13-132</a> The complaint alleged that Marguerite constantly nagged
Ekdahl and argued “with reference to money matters,” accused him of
infidelity, threw things at him, and finally ordered him out of the
house; that these acts were unprovoked by Ekdahl’s conduct toward
her; that her acts endangered his already impaired health; and that her
“excesses, harsh and cruel treatment and outrages” toward him made
it impossible for them to live together.<a id="FNanchor_A13-133" href="#Footnote_A13-133" class="fnanchor">A13-133</a> She denied all these allegations.<a id="FNanchor_A13-134" href="#Footnote_A13-134" class="fnanchor">A13-134</a>
After a trial, at which John testified and, he thought, Lee
was called to the stand but was excused without testifying,<a id="FNanchor_A13-135" href="#Footnote_A13-135" class="fnanchor">A13-135</a> the
jury found on special issues that Marguerite was “guilty of excesses,
cruel treatment, or outrages” unprovoked by Ekdahl’s conduct.<a id="FNanchor_A13-136" href="#Footnote_A13-136" class="fnanchor">A13-136</a> On
June 24, the court granted the divorce and approved an agreement
between the parties disposing of their property between them and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_674">674</span>
awarding Marguerite $1,500; at her request, the divorce restored to
Marguerite her former name, Marguerite C. Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A13-137" href="#Footnote_A13-137" class="fnanchor">A13-137</a></p>

<p>While the divorce suit was pending, Marguerite moved from Eighth
Avenue to a house on 3300 Willing Street, next to railroad tracks.<a id="FNanchor_A13-138" href="#Footnote_A13-138" class="fnanchor">A13-138</a>
The boys found her there in May when they returned from the military
academy; for John, the move signified that they “were back
down in the lower class again.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-139" href="#Footnote_A13-139" class="fnanchor">A13-139</a> Lee’s withdrawal from the Clayton
School on March 18, 1948,<a id="FNanchor_A13-140" href="#Footnote_A13-140" class="fnanchor">A13-140</a> probably coincided with the move to
Willing Street. He entered the Clark Elementary School on the
following day, and in June completed the second grade with a record
mostly of B’s and A’s.<a id="FNanchor_A13-141" href="#Footnote_A13-141" class="fnanchor">A13-141</a> Philip Vinson, a classmate at the Clayton
School, has described Lee at that time as “a quiet type of kid,” who
“didn’t make a lot of noise.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-142" href="#Footnote_A13-142" class="fnanchor">A13-142</a> Lee was “stocky and well built,” which
made other boys look up to him and regard him as the leader of one
of their schoolyard “gangs.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-143" href="#Footnote_A13-143" class="fnanchor">A13-143</a> Vinson thought that Lee was not a
bully and got along with his classmates, but had the impression that
he rarely played with them or brought them home after school.<a id="FNanchor_A13-144" href="#Footnote_A13-144" class="fnanchor">A13-144</a></p>

<p>Shortly after the divorce, Mrs. Oswald purchased a small house in
Benbrook, on what is now San Saba Street;<a id="FNanchor_A13-145" href="#Footnote_A13-145" class="fnanchor">A13-145</a> John has testified that
it had a single bedroom, in which Lee slept with his mother, and a
screened porch where John and Robert slept.<a id="FNanchor_A13-146" href="#Footnote_A13-146" class="fnanchor">A13-146</a> Mrs. Oswald worked
at a department store in Fort Worth, and left the three boys home
alone.<a id="FNanchor_A13-147" href="#Footnote_A13-147" class="fnanchor">A13-147</a> A neighbor, Mrs. W. H. Bell, has stated that Lee seemed to
enjoy being by himself and to resent discipline;<a id="FNanchor_A13-148" href="#Footnote_A13-148" class="fnanchor">A13-148</a> another neighbor,
Otis R. Carlton, stated that he once saw Lee chase John with a knife
and throw it at him, an incident which, Carlton said, their mother
passed off as a “little scuffle.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-149" href="#Footnote_A13-149" class="fnanchor">A13-149</a> At the end of the summer, Carlton
purchased the property. He stated that he appraised it at $2,750
at Mrs. Oswald’s request; she then insisted that he had made an offer
to purchase at that price, which he finally agreed to do.<a id="FNanchor_A13-150" href="#Footnote_A13-150" class="fnanchor">A13-150</a></p>

<p>After the house was sold, the family returned to Fort Worth, a
move necessitated by Mrs. Oswald’s, and now John’s, employment.<a id="FNanchor_A13-151" href="#Footnote_A13-151" class="fnanchor">A13-151</a>
Mrs. Oswald bought a two-bedroom, frame house at 7408 Ewing, from
which Robert and Lee could walk to school.<a id="FNanchor_A13-152" href="#Footnote_A13-152" class="fnanchor">A13-152</a> John, who was then
16, obtained a job as a shoe stockboy at Everybody’s Department Store;
he testified that he wanted to finish high school at the military academy,
but that his mother advised him to leave school and help to
support the family.<a id="FNanchor_A13-153" href="#Footnote_A13-153" class="fnanchor">A13-153</a> He gave her $15 per week out of his salary of
$25.<a id="FNanchor_A13-154" href="#Footnote_A13-154" class="fnanchor">A13-154</a> Robert returned to school.<a id="FNanchor_A13-155" href="#Footnote_A13-155" class="fnanchor">A13-155</a></p>

<p>Lee entered the third grade at the Arlington Heights Elementary
School.<a id="FNanchor_A13-156" href="#Footnote_A13-156" class="fnanchor">A13-156</a> He remained at Arlington Heights for the entire school
year, completing the third grade with a satisfactory record, which
included A’s in social studies, citizenship, elementary science, art,
and music, and a D in spelling.<a id="FNanchor_A13-157" href="#Footnote_A13-157" class="fnanchor">A13-157</a> In September 1949, he transferred
to the Ridglea West Elementary School, where he remained
for the next 3 years.<a id="FNanchor_A13-158" href="#Footnote_A13-158" class="fnanchor">A13-158</a> Lee’s record at Ridglea is not remarkable in
any respect. In the fourth and fifth grades, he received mostly B’s;
in the sixth grade, B’s and C’s predominate.<a id="FNanchor_A13-159" href="#Footnote_A13-159" class="fnanchor">A13-159</a> He received D’s in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_675">675</span>
both the fifth and sixth grades in spelling and arithmetic; in the fourth
and sixth grades, C’s are recorded for Spanish,<a id="FNanchor_A13-160" href="#Footnote_A13-160" class="fnanchor">A13-160</a> which may account
for his rudimentary familiarity with that language later on.<a id="FNanchor_A13-161" href="#Footnote_A13-161" class="fnanchor">A13-161</a> In
the fourth grade his IQ was recorded at 103; on achievement tests in
each of the 3 years, he twice did best in reading and twice did worst
in spelling.<a id="FNanchor_A13-162" href="#Footnote_A13-162" class="fnanchor">A13-162</a></p>

<p>Lee is generally characterized as an unexceptional but rather solitary
boy during these years. His mother worked in a variety of
jobs,<a id="FNanchor_A13-163" href="#Footnote_A13-163" class="fnanchor">A13-163</a> and, according to her own testimony, told Lee not to contact
her at work except in an emergency.<a id="FNanchor_A13-164" href="#Footnote_A13-164" class="fnanchor">A13-164</a> He ordinarily returned home
alone directly after school, in obedience to his mother’s instructions.<a id="FNanchor_A13-165" href="#Footnote_A13-165" class="fnanchor">A13-165</a>
A fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Clyde I. Livingston, described him as a
lonely boy, quiet and shy, who did not easily form friendships with
other students.<a id="FNanchor_A13-166" href="#Footnote_A13-166" class="fnanchor">A13-166</a> But Richard W. Garrett has stated that he was a
classmate of Lee in the fourth or fifth grade and found him easy to
get along with; he recalled playing with Lee often at school and sometimes
walking home together with him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-167" href="#Footnote_A13-167" class="fnanchor">A13-167</a> Mrs. Livingston recalled
that at Christmas 1949, Lee gave her a puppy and afterward came to
her home to see the puppy and talk to her and her family.<a id="FNanchor_A13-168" href="#Footnote_A13-168" class="fnanchor">A13-168</a></p>

<p>Lee’s relationship with his brothers was good but limited by the
difference in their ages.<a id="FNanchor_A13-169" href="#Footnote_A13-169" class="fnanchor">A13-169</a> He still had a dog,<a id="FNanchor_A13-170" href="#Footnote_A13-170" class="fnanchor">A13-170</a> but there were few
children of his age in the neighborhood, and he appears to have been
by himself after school most of the time.<a id="FNanchor_A13-171" href="#Footnote_A13-171" class="fnanchor">A13-171</a> He read a lot,<a id="FNanchor_A13-172" href="#Footnote_A13-172" class="fnanchor">A13-172</a> had a
stamp collection, and played chess and Monopoly with his brothers.<a id="FNanchor_A13-173" href="#Footnote_A13-173" class="fnanchor">A13-173</a>
Mrs. Murret remembered that on a visit to her home in New Orleans,
Lee refused to play with other children or even to leave the house; he
preferred to stay indoors and read (mostly “funnybooks”) or listen
to the radio.<a id="FNanchor_A13-174" href="#Footnote_A13-174" class="fnanchor">A13-174</a> After several weeks with the Murrets, Lee wrote to
his mother and asked her to come for him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-175" href="#Footnote_A13-175" class="fnanchor">A13-175</a> Hiram Conway, a
neighbor on Ewing Street, thought Lee was an intelligent child, who
picked things up easily; although he did not recall many specific
incidents to support his impressions, Conway regarded Lee as “a bad
kid,” who was “quick to anger” and “mean when he was angry, just
ornery.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-176" href="#Footnote_A13-176" class="fnanchor">A13-176</a> John’s general picture of Lee in these years is that of “a
normal healthy robust boy who would get in fights and still have his
serious moments.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-177" href="#Footnote_A13-177" class="fnanchor">A13-177</a></p>

<p>John returned to high school in January 1949, but continued to work
part time.<a id="FNanchor_A13-178" href="#Footnote_A13-178" class="fnanchor">A13-178</a> Early in 1950, he entered the Coast Guard.<a id="FNanchor_A13-179" href="#Footnote_A13-179" class="fnanchor">A13-179</a> Robert
left school soon after John’s departure and went to work full time,
contributing most of his earnings to the support of his family.<a id="FNanchor_A13-180" href="#Footnote_A13-180" class="fnanchor">A13-180</a> He
returned to school in 1951-52, and after completing his junior year
in high school, joined the Marines in July 1952.<a id="FNanchor_A13-181" href="#Footnote_A13-181" class="fnanchor">A13-181</a> In August, Mrs.
Oswald and Lee moved to New York, where John was living with his
wife and a very young baby in an apartment at 325 East 92d
Street; the apartment belonged to John’s mother-in-law, who was
temporarily away.<a id="FNanchor_A13-182" href="#Footnote_A13-182" class="fnanchor">A13-182</a> Mrs. Oswald has explained that with Robert
gone she did not want Lee to be alone while she worked and that she
went to New York City “not as a venture,” but because she “had
family” there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_676">676</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-183" href="#Footnote_A13-183" class="fnanchor">A13-183</a></p>

<p>The visit began well. John testified of his meeting with Lee: “We
met in the street and I was real glad to see him and he was real glad
to see me. We were real good friends.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-184" href="#Footnote_A13-184" class="fnanchor">A13-184</a> He took about a week of
leave and showed Lee the city; he remembered trips to the Museum
of Natural History and Polk’s Hobby Shop, and a ride on the
Staten Island ferry.<a id="FNanchor_A13-185" href="#Footnote_A13-185" class="fnanchor">A13-185</a> But when it became obvious that his
mother intended to stay, the atmosphere changed. Mrs. Oswald
did not get along with John’s wife, with whom she quarreled
frequently.<a id="FNanchor_A13-186" href="#Footnote_A13-186" class="fnanchor">A13-186</a> There was difficulty about her failure to contribute
anything towards her own and Lee’s support.<a id="FNanchor_A13-187" href="#Footnote_A13-187" class="fnanchor">A13-187</a> According to
John, his wife liked Lee and would have been glad to have him
alone stay with them but felt that his mother set Lee against her;
they never suggested that Lee remain with them since they knew that
it would not work out.<a id="FNanchor_A13-188" href="#Footnote_A13-188" class="fnanchor">A13-188</a> The visit ended when Lee threatened Mrs.
Pic with a pocket knife during a quarrel,<a id="FNanchor_A13-189" href="#Footnote_A13-189" class="fnanchor">A13-189</a> and she asked Mrs. Oswald
to leave.<a id="FNanchor_A13-190" href="#Footnote_A13-190" class="fnanchor">A13-190</a> John testified that during this same quarrel Lee hit his
mother, who appeared to have lost all control over him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-191" href="#Footnote_A13-191" class="fnanchor">A13-191</a> The
incident permanently destroyed the good relationship between Lee
and his brother.<a id="FNanchor_A13-192" href="#Footnote_A13-192" class="fnanchor">A13-192</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Oswald and Lee moved uptown to a one-room basement apartment<a id="FNanchor_A13-193" href="#Footnote_A13-193" class="fnanchor">A13-193</a>
in the Bronx, at 1455 Sheridan Avenue.<a id="FNanchor_A13-194" href="#Footnote_A13-194" class="fnanchor">A13-194</a> While they were
still at the Pics, he had been enrolled at the Trinity Evangelical Lutheran
School on Watson Avenue.<a id="FNanchor_A13-195" href="#Footnote_A13-195" class="fnanchor">A13-195</a> He was withdrawn on September
26, after several weeks of irregular attendance, and 4 days later
enrolled in the seventh grade of Public School 117, a junior high
school.<a id="FNanchor_A13-196" href="#Footnote_A13-196" class="fnanchor">A13-196</a> Mrs. Oswald found a job at one of the Lerner Shops, a
chain of dress shops for which she had worked briefly in Fort Worth
several years before.<a id="FNanchor_A13-197" href="#Footnote_A13-197" class="fnanchor">A13-197</a> In January, they moved again, to 825 East
179th Street,<a id="FNanchor_A13-198" href="#Footnote_A13-198" class="fnanchor">A13-198</a> and a few weeks later, she left the employ of Lerner
Shops.<a id="FNanchor_A13-199" href="#Footnote_A13-199" class="fnanchor">A13-199</a> In April, she was working at Martin’s Department Store
in Brooklyn, where she earned $45 per week;<a id="FNanchor_A13-200" href="#Footnote_A13-200" class="fnanchor">A13-200</a> in May, she went to
work for a chain of hosiery shops, with which she remained until
December.<a id="FNanchor_A13-201" href="#Footnote_A13-201" class="fnanchor">A13-201</a> Lee was registered at Public School 117 until January
16, 1953,<a id="FNanchor_A13-202" href="#Footnote_A13-202" class="fnanchor">A13-202</a> although the move to 179th Street, which took him
out of that school district, probably took place before that date.<a id="FNanchor_A13-203" href="#Footnote_A13-203" class="fnanchor">A13-203</a> He
had been at Public School 117 for 64 schooldays, out of which he had
been present on 15 full and 2 half days;<a id="FNanchor_A13-204" href="#Footnote_A13-204" class="fnanchor">A13-204</a> he had received failing
grades in most of his courses.<a id="FNanchor_A13-205" href="#Footnote_A13-205" class="fnanchor">A13-205</a></p>

<p>Lee’s truancy increased after he moved; he was now located in the
school district of Public School 44 but refused to go to school there.<a id="FNanchor_A13-206" href="#Footnote_A13-206" class="fnanchor">A13-206</a>
On one occasion that spring, an attendance officer located Lee at the
Bronx Zoo; the officer testified that Lee was clean and well dressed, but
was surly and referred to the officer as a “damned Yankee.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-207" href="#Footnote_A13-207" class="fnanchor">A13-207</a> Several
truancy hearings were held in January, at the first of which at least,
both Mrs. Oswald and Lee evidently failed to appear.<a id="FNanchor_A13-208" href="#Footnote_A13-208" class="fnanchor">A13-208</a> At a hearing
on January 27, by which time it was known that Lee was living
in the Public School 44 district, it was decided to commence judicial
proceedings if his truancy continued.<a id="FNanchor_A13-209" href="#Footnote_A13-209" class="fnanchor">A13-209</a> Meanwhile, on January 16,
his mother called the Community Service Society, to which she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_677">677</span>
been referred by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, and
asked for an appointment to discuss the problem.<a id="FNanchor_A13-210" href="#Footnote_A13-210" class="fnanchor">A13-210</a> She mentioned
that a truancy hearing had been held and said that Lee would not
attend school despite the threat of official action; she thought that
his behavior was due to difficulty in adjusting to his new environment.<a id="FNanchor_A13-211" href="#Footnote_A13-211" class="fnanchor">A13-211</a>
An appointment was scheduled for January 30, but she
failed to appear, and the case was closed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-212" href="#Footnote_A13-212" class="fnanchor">A13-212</a> Sometime in February, the
Pics visited the Oswalds. John testified that his mother told him about
Lee’s truancy and asked how she could get Lee to accept psychiatric
aid. Nothing came of these discussions.<a id="FNanchor_A13-213" href="#Footnote_A13-213" class="fnanchor">A13-213</a></p>

<p>On March 12, the attendance officer in charge of Lee’s case filed
a petition in court which alleged that Lee had been “excessively absent
from school” between October and January, that he had refused to
register at Public School 44 or to attend school there, and that he was
“beyond the control of his mother insofar as school attendance is concerned.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-214" href="#Footnote_A13-214" class="fnanchor">A13-214</a>
On the same day, Mrs. Oswald appeared in court alone
and informed the presiding judge that Lee refused to appear in
court.<a id="FNanchor_A13-215" href="#Footnote_A13-215" class="fnanchor">A13-215</a> Evidently impressed by the proceedings, however, Lee did
register at Public School 44 on March 23.<a id="FNanchor_A13-216" href="#Footnote_A13-216" class="fnanchor">A13-216</a> Nevertheless, on
April 16, Justice Delany declared him a truant, and remanded him
to Youth House until May 7 for psychiatric study.<a id="FNanchor_A13-217" href="#Footnote_A13-217" class="fnanchor">A13-217</a></p>

<p>In accordance with the regular procedures at Youth House, Lee
took a series of tests and was interviewed by a staff social worker and a
probation officer, both of whom interviewed Mrs. Oswald as well.<a id="FNanchor_A13-218" href="#Footnote_A13-218" class="fnanchor">A13-218</a>
Their findings, discussed more fully in chapter VII of the Commission’s
report, indicated that Lee was a withdrawn, socially maladjusted
boy, whose mother did not interest herself sufficiently in his welfare
and had failed to establish a close relationship with him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-219" href="#Footnote_A13-219" class="fnanchor">A13-219</a> Mrs.
Oswald visited Lee at Youth House and came away with a highly unfavorable
impression; she regarded it as unfit for her son.<a id="FNanchor_A13-220" href="#Footnote_A13-220" class="fnanchor">A13-220</a> On the
basis of all the test results and reports and his own interview with
Lee, Dr. Renatus Hartogs, the chief staff psychiatrist, recommended
that Lee be placed on probation with a requirement that he seek
help from a child guidance clinic, and that his mother be urged
to contact a family agency for help; he recommended that Lee not
be placed in an institution unless treatment during probation was
unsuccessful.<a id="FNanchor_A13-221" href="#Footnote_A13-221" class="fnanchor">A13-221</a></p>

<p>Lee returned to court on May 7. He and his mother appeared before
Justice McClancy, who discussed the Youth House reports with
them.<a id="FNanchor_A13-222" href="#Footnote_A13-222" class="fnanchor">A13-222</a> He released Lee on parole until September 24, and requested
that a referral be made to the Community Service Society for treatment.<a id="FNanchor_A13-223" href="#Footnote_A13-223" class="fnanchor">A13-223</a>
The probation officer called the society on the same day but
was told that it would probably not be able to take the case because of
its already full case load and the intensive treatment which Lee was
likely to require;<a id="FNanchor_A13-224" href="#Footnote_A13-224" class="fnanchor">A13-224</a> it confirmed this position 1 week later and closed
the case on May 31.<a id="FNanchor_A13-225" href="#Footnote_A13-225" class="fnanchor">A13-225</a> An application was made to the Salvation
Army also, which turned it down because it could not provide the
needed services.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_678">678</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-226" href="#Footnote_A13-226" class="fnanchor">A13-226</a></p>

<p>During the few weeks of school which remained, Lee attended school
regularly, and completed the seventh grade with low but passing marks
in all his academic subjects.<a id="FNanchor_A13-227" href="#Footnote_A13-227" class="fnanchor">A13-227</a> (He received a failing mark in a home
economics course.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-228" href="#Footnote_A13-228" class="fnanchor">A13-228</a> His conduct was generally satisfactory and he
was rated outstanding in “Social-Participation”; the record indicates
that he belonged to a model airplane club and had a special interest in
horseback riding.<a id="FNanchor_A13-229" href="#Footnote_A13-229" class="fnanchor">A13-229</a> Robert Oswald visited New York that summer,
while he was on leave from the Marines.<a id="FNanchor_A13-230" href="#Footnote_A13-230" class="fnanchor">A13-230</a> Lee did not appear to him
to be unhappy or to be acting abnormally, nor did Robert observe that
relations between Lee and his mother were strained.<a id="FNanchor_A13-231" href="#Footnote_A13-231" class="fnanchor">A13-231</a> Lee’s truancy
the previous fall and winter was apparently discussed only in passing,
when Mrs. Oswald mentioned that Lee had had to appear before a
judge.<a id="FNanchor_A13-232" href="#Footnote_A13-232" class="fnanchor">A13-232</a></p>

<p>On September 14, Lee entered the eighth grade at Public School
44.<a id="FNanchor_A13-233" href="#Footnote_A13-233" class="fnanchor">A13-233</a> His parole was due to end 10 days later. On September 24,
however, Mrs. Oswald telephoned the probation officer and advised that
she could not appear in court; she added that there was no need for her
to do so, since Lee was attending school regularly and was now well
adjusted.<a id="FNanchor_A13-234" href="#Footnote_A13-234" class="fnanchor">A13-234</a> The parole was extended until October 29, before which
date the school was to submit a progress report.<a id="FNanchor_A13-235" href="#Footnote_A13-235" class="fnanchor">A13-235</a> The report was
highly unfavorable. Although Lee was attending school regularly,
his conduct was unsatisfactory; teachers reported that he refused to
salute the flag, did little work, and seemed to spend most of his time
“sailing paper planes around the room.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-236" href="#Footnote_A13-236" class="fnanchor">A13-236</a> On October 29, Mrs. Oswald
again telephoned to say that she would be unable to appear.
Justice Sicher continued Lee’s parole until November 19 and directed
the probation officer to make a referral to the Berkshire Industrial
Farm or Children’s Village.<a id="FNanchor_A13-237" href="#Footnote_A13-237" class="fnanchor">A13-237</a></p>

<p>Before the next hearing, Mrs. Oswald discussed Lee’s behavior with
the school authorities, who indicated to the probation officer that
Lee’s behavior improved considerably after her visit to the school.<a id="FNanchor_A13-238" href="#Footnote_A13-238" class="fnanchor">A13-238</a>
He did, in fact, receive passing grades in most of his subjects in the
first marking period. His report also contains notations by his teachers
that he was “quick-tempered,” “constantly losing control,” and
“getting into battles with others.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-239" href="#Footnote_A13-239" class="fnanchor">A13-239</a> Both Lee and his mother
appeared in court on November 19. Despite Mrs. Oswald’s request
that Lee be discharged, Justice Sicher stated his belief that Lee needed
treatment, and continued his parole until January 28, 1954; the probation
officer was directed to contact the Big Brothers counseling service
in the meantime.<a id="FNanchor_A13-240" href="#Footnote_A13-240" class="fnanchor">A13-240</a></p>

<p>At the request of the probation officer, the Big Brothers office contacted
Mrs. Oswald in December, and on January 4 a caseworker
visited her and Lee at home.<a id="FNanchor_A13-241" href="#Footnote_A13-241" class="fnanchor">A13-241</a> The caseworker reported that he was
cordially received but was told by Mrs. Oswald that continued counseling
was unnecessary; she pointed out to him that Lee now belonged
to the West Side YMCA, which he attended every Saturday. The
caseworker reported, however, that Lee was plainly “displeased with
the idea of being forced to join various ‘Y’ organizations about which
he cared little.” Mrs. Oswald declared her intention to return to New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_679">679</span>
Orleans and was advised to obtain Lee’s release from the court’s jurisdiction
before she left.<a id="FNanchor_A13-242" href="#Footnote_A13-242" class="fnanchor">A13-242</a> On the following day, she called the probation
officer, who was away on vacation, and was advised by his office
again not to take Lee out of the jurisdiction without the court’s consent.<a id="FNanchor_A13-243" href="#Footnote_A13-243" class="fnanchor">A13-243</a>
The same advice was repeated to her by the Big Brothers
caseworker on January 6. <a id="FNanchor_A13-244" href="#Footnote_A13-244" class="fnanchor">A13-244</a> Through all these contacts, Mrs. Oswald
had evidenced reluctance to bring Lee into court, prompted probably
by fear that he would be retained in some sort of custody as he had
been at the time of the commitment to Youth House.<a id="FNanchor_A13-245" href="#Footnote_A13-245" class="fnanchor">A13-245</a> Without further
communication to the court, Mrs. Oswald and Lee returned to
New Orleans sometime before January 10.<a id="FNanchor_A13-246" href="#Footnote_A13-246" class="fnanchor">A13-246</a> On March 11, the court
dismissed the case.<a id="FNanchor_A13-247" href="#Footnote_A13-247" class="fnanchor">A13-247</a></p>

<p>In New Orleans, Lee and his mother stayed with the Murrets at
757 French Street while they looked for an apartment.<a id="FNanchor_A13-248" href="#Footnote_A13-248" class="fnanchor">A13-248</a> Lee enrolled
in the eighth grade at Beauregard Junior High School on January
13<a id="FNanchor_A13-249" href="#Footnote_A13-249" class="fnanchor">A13-249</a> and completed the school year without apparent difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_A13-250" href="#Footnote_A13-250" class="fnanchor">A13-250</a> He
entered the ninth grade in September and again received mediocre
but acceptable marks.<a id="FNanchor_A13-251" href="#Footnote_A13-251" class="fnanchor">A13-251</a> In October 1954, Lee took a series of achievement
tests, on which he did well in reading and vocabulary, badly in
mathematics.<a id="FNanchor_A13-252" href="#Footnote_A13-252" class="fnanchor">A13-252</a> At the end of the school year, on June 2, 1955, he
filled out a “personal history.” He indicated that the subjects which
he liked best were civics, science, and mathematics; those he liked
least were English and art. His vocational preferences were listed
as biology and mechanical drawing; his plans after high school, however,
were noted as “military service” and “undecided.” He said that
reading and outdoor sports were his recreational activities and that
he liked football in particular. In response to the question whether
he had “any close friends in this school,” he wrote, “no.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-253" href="#Footnote_A13-253" class="fnanchor">A13-253</a></p>

<p>Lee is remembered by those who knew him in New Orleans as a
quiet, solitary boy who made few friends.<a id="FNanchor_A13-254" href="#Footnote_A13-254" class="fnanchor">A13-254</a> He was briefly a member
of the Civil Air Patrol,<a id="FNanchor_A13-255" href="#Footnote_A13-255" class="fnanchor">A13-255</a> and considered joining an organization of
high school students interested in astronomy;<a id="FNanchor_A13-256" href="#Footnote_A13-256" class="fnanchor">A13-256</a> occasionally, he
played pool or darts with his friend, Edward Voebel.<a id="FNanchor_A13-257" href="#Footnote_A13-257" class="fnanchor">A13-257</a> Beyond this,
he seems to have had few contacts with other people. He read a lot,
starting at some point to read Communist literature which he found
at the public library;<a id="FNanchor_A13-258" href="#Footnote_A13-258" class="fnanchor">A13-258</a> he walked or rode a bicycle, sometimes visiting
a museum.<a id="FNanchor_A13-259" href="#Footnote_A13-259" class="fnanchor">A13-259</a> Except in his relations with his mother, he was not unusually
argumentative or belligerent, but he seems not to have avoided
fights if they came; they did come fairly frequently, perhaps in part
because of his aloofness from his fellows and the traces of a northern
accent in his speech.<a id="FNanchor_A13-260" href="#Footnote_A13-260" class="fnanchor">A13-260</a> His only close friendship, with Voebel, arose
when Voebel helped him tend his wounds after a fight.<a id="FNanchor_A13-261" href="#Footnote_A13-261" class="fnanchor">A13-261</a> Friends of
Mrs. Oswald thought that he was demanding and insolent toward her
and that she had no control over him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-262" href="#Footnote_A13-262" class="fnanchor">A13-262</a></p>

<p>While Lee was in the eighth and ninth grades, Mrs. Oswald worked
first at Burt’s Shoestore<a id="FNanchor_A13-263" href="#Footnote_A13-263" class="fnanchor">A13-263</a> and then at the Dolly Shoe Co.<a id="FNanchor_A13-264" href="#Footnote_A13-264" class="fnanchor">A13-264</a> One of
her employers at Dolly, where she worked as a cashier and salesclerk,
remembered her as a pleasant person and a good worker.<a id="FNanchor_A13-265" href="#Footnote_A13-265" class="fnanchor">A13-265</a> At her request,
the company hired Lee to work part time; he worked there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_680">680</span>
mostly on Saturdays, for about 10 weeks in 1955.<a id="FNanchor_A13-266" href="#Footnote_A13-266" class="fnanchor">A13-266</a> On the “personal
history” record which he filled out in school, he stated that he had been
a “retail shoesalesman”;<a id="FNanchor_A13-267" href="#Footnote_A13-267" class="fnanchor">A13-267</a> but his employer recalled that they had
tried to train him as a salesman without success and that he had in
fact been a stockboy.<a id="FNanchor_A13-268" href="#Footnote_A13-268" class="fnanchor">A13-268</a></p>

<p>After a short period with the Murrets, Mrs. Oswald and Lee had
moved to an apartment owned by Myrtle Evans at 1454 Saint Mary
Street, which she and Mrs. Murret helped to furnish; later they moved
to a less expensive apartment in the same building, the address of which
was 1452 Saint Mary Street.<a id="FNanchor_A13-269" href="#Footnote_A13-269" class="fnanchor">A13-269</a> Relations between Mrs. Oswald and
Mrs. Evans became strained,<a id="FNanchor_A13-270" href="#Footnote_A13-270" class="fnanchor">A13-270</a> and in the spring of 1955 the Oswalds
moved to a new apartment at 126 Exchange Place in the French
Quarter.<a id="FNanchor_A13-271" href="#Footnote_A13-271" class="fnanchor">A13-271</a> Although Lee gave the Exchange Place address on a
school form at the end of the ninth grade,<a id="FNanchor_A13-272" href="#Footnote_A13-272" class="fnanchor">A13-272</a> the school authorities had
apparently not been advised of these moves earlier, because Mrs.
Oswald did not want Lee to be transferred from Beauregard, which
she considered a good school.<a id="FNanchor_A13-273" href="#Footnote_A13-273" class="fnanchor">A13-273</a> During the summer of 1955, Robert
left the Marine Corps and spent a week with his mother and Lee in New
Orleans before moving to Fort Worth; he found Lee unchanged.<a id="FNanchor_A13-274" href="#Footnote_A13-274" class="fnanchor">A13-274</a></p>

<p>That fall, Lee entered the 10th grade at Warren Easton High
School.<a id="FNanchor_A13-275" href="#Footnote_A13-275" class="fnanchor">A13-275</a> He had been there for about a month when he presented to
the school authorities a note written by himself to which he had signed
his mother’s name. It was dated October 7, 1955, and read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="in0">To whom it may concern,</p>

<p>Becaus we are moving to San Diego in the middle of this
month Lee must quit school now. Also, please send by him any
papers such as his birth certificate that you may have. Thank
you.</p>

<p>
Sincirely</p>

<p class="sigright">Mrs. M. Oswald<a id="FNanchor_A13-276" href="#Footnote_A13-276" class="fnanchor">A13-276</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>He dropped out of school a few days later, shortly before his 16th
birthday.<a id="FNanchor_A13-277" href="#Footnote_A13-277" class="fnanchor">A13-277</a> After his birthday, he tried to enlist in the Marines,
using a false affidavit from his mother that he was 17.<a id="FNanchor_A13-278" href="#Footnote_A13-278" class="fnanchor">A13-278</a> (Some years
before, John Pic had joined the Marine Corps Reserve by means of his
mother’s false affidavit that he was 17.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-279" href="#Footnote_A13-279" class="fnanchor">A13-279</a> The attempt failed, and,
according to his mother’s testimony, Lee spent the next year reading
and memorizing the “Marine Manual,” which he had obtained from
Robert and “living to when he is age 17 to join the Marines.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-280" href="#Footnote_A13-280" class="fnanchor">A13-280</a>
He worked for the rest of the school year. Between November 10 and
January 14, he was a messenger boy for Gerald F. Tujague, Inc., a
shipping company, where he earned $130 per month.<a id="FNanchor_A13-281" href="#Footnote_A13-281" class="fnanchor">A13-281</a> His employer
remembers him as a quiet, withdrawn person.<a id="FNanchor_A13-282" href="#Footnote_A13-282" class="fnanchor">A13-282</a> In January he
worked briefly as an office boy for J. R. Michels, Inc.<a id="FNanchor_A13-283" href="#Footnote_A13-283" class="fnanchor">A13-283</a> For several
months thereafter, he was a messenger for the Pfisterer Dental Laboratory.<a id="FNanchor_A13-284" href="#Footnote_A13-284" class="fnanchor">A13-284</a>
His military record subsequently described his prior civilian
jobs as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_681">681</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Performed various clerical duties such as distributing mail, delivering
messages &amp; answering telephone. Helped file records &amp;
operated ditto, letter opening &amp; sealing machines.<a id="FNanchor_A13-285" href="#Footnote_A13-285" class="fnanchor">A13-285</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Anticipating that Lee would join the Marines as soon as he was
17, Mrs. Oswald moved in July 1956 to Fort Worth,<a id="FNanchor_A13-286" href="#Footnote_A13-286" class="fnanchor">A13-286</a> where she
took an apartment at 4936 Collinswood for herself, Lee, and Robert.<a id="FNanchor_A13-287" href="#Footnote_A13-287" class="fnanchor">A13-287</a>
In September, Lee enrolled in the 10th grade at the Arlington Heights
High School<a id="FNanchor_A13-288" href="#Footnote_A13-288" class="fnanchor">A13-288</a> but attended classes for only a few weeks. He
dropped out of school on September 28.<a id="FNanchor_A13-289" href="#Footnote_A13-289" class="fnanchor">A13-289</a> A few days later, he wrote
the following letter to the Socialist Party of America:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">October 3, 1956</p>

<p class="in0">Dear Sirs;
</p>

<p>I am sixteen years of age and would like more information
about your youth League, I would like to know if there is a
branch in my area, how to join, ect., I am a Marxist, and have
been studying socialist principles for well over fifteen months
I am very interested in your Y.P.S.L.</p>

<p class="sigright">/s/ Lee Oswald<a id="FNanchor_A13-290" href="#Footnote_A13-290" class="fnanchor">A13-290</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Accompanying the letter was an advertisement coupon, on which
he had checked the box requesting information about the Socialist
Party.<a id="FNanchor_A13-291" href="#Footnote_A13-291" class="fnanchor">A13-291</a></p>

<p>Lee became 17 on October 18. He enlisted in the Marines on
October 24.<a id="FNanchor_A13-292" href="#Footnote_A13-292" class="fnanchor">A13-292</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr244">MARINES</h3>

<p>On October 26, 1956, Lee Harvey Oswald reported for duty at the
Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego, Calif., where he was
assigned to the Second Recruit Training Battalion.<a id="FNanchor_A13-293" href="#Footnote_A13-293" class="fnanchor">A13-293</a> He was 68
inches tall and weighed 135 pounds; he had no physical defects.<a id="FNanchor_A13-294" href="#Footnote_A13-294" class="fnanchor">A13-294</a>
On October 30, he took a series of aptitude tests, on which he scored
significantly above the Marine Corps average in reading and vocabulary
and significantly below the average in tests in arithmetic and
pattern analysis. His composite general classification score was 105,
2 points below the Corps average. He scored near the bottom of the
lowest group in a radio code test.<a id="FNanchor_A13-295" href="#Footnote_A13-295" class="fnanchor">A13-295</a> His preference of duty was
recorded as Aircraft Maintenance and Repair, the duty assignment
for which he was recommended.<a id="FNanchor_A13-296" href="#Footnote_A13-296" class="fnanchor">A13-296</a></p>

<p>While he was at San Diego, Oswald was trained in the use of the
M-1 rifle.<a id="FNanchor_A13-297" href="#Footnote_A13-297" class="fnanchor">A13-297</a> His practice scores were not very good,<a id="FNanchor_A13-298" href="#Footnote_A13-298" class="fnanchor">A13-298</a> but when his
company fired for record on December 21, he scored 212, 2 points
above the score necessary to qualify as a “sharpshooter” on a marksman/sharpshooter/expert
scale.<a id="FNanchor_A13-299" href="#Footnote_A13-299" class="fnanchor">A13-299</a> He did not do nearly as well when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_682">682</span>
he fired for record again shortly before he left the Marines.<a id="FNanchor_A13-300" href="#Footnote_A13-300" class="fnanchor">A13-300</a> He
practiced also with a riot gun and a .45-caliber pistol when he
was in the Marines but no scores were recorded.<a id="FNanchor_A13-301" href="#Footnote_A13-301" class="fnanchor">A13-301</a></p>

<p>Oswald was given a 4.4 rating in both “conduct” and “proficiency”
at the Recruit Depot, the highest possible rating being 5.0 and an
average rating of 4.0 being required for an honorable discharge.<a id="FNanchor_A13-302" href="#Footnote_A13-302" class="fnanchor">A13-302</a>
On January 18, 1957, he reported to Camp Pendleton, Calif., for further
training and was assigned to “A” Company of the First Battalion,
Second Infantry Training Regiment.<a id="FNanchor_A13-303" href="#Footnote_A13-303" class="fnanchor">A13-303</a> He was at Pendleton for
a little more than 5 weeks, at the end of which he was rated 4.2 in
conduct and 4.0 in proficiency.<a id="FNanchor_A13-304" href="#Footnote_A13-304" class="fnanchor">A13-304</a> Allen R. Felde, a fellow recruit
who was with Oswald at San Diego and Pendleton, has stated that
Oswald was generally unpopular and that his company was avoided
by the other men.<a id="FNanchor_A13-305" href="#Footnote_A13-305" class="fnanchor">A13-305</a> When his squad was given its first weekend
leave from Pendleton, all eight men took a cab to Tijuana, Mexico.
Oswald left the others and did not rejoin them until it was time to
return to camp. Felde said that this practice was repeated on other
trips to Los Angeles; Oswald accompanied the men on the bus to
and from camp but did not stay with them in the city.<a id="FNanchor_A13-306" href="#Footnote_A13-306" class="fnanchor">A13-306</a> On February
27, he went on leave for 2 weeks,<a id="FNanchor_A13-307" href="#Footnote_A13-307" class="fnanchor">A13-307</a> during which he may have
visited his mother in Fort Worth.<a id="FNanchor_A13-308" href="#Footnote_A13-308" class="fnanchor">A13-308</a></p>

<p>On March 18, he reported to the Naval Air Technical Training
Center at the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Fla.<a id="FNanchor_A13-309" href="#Footnote_A13-309" class="fnanchor">A13-309</a> For the
next 6 weeks he attended an Aviation Fundamental School, in which
he received basic instruction in his specialty, including such subjects
as basic radar theory, map reading, and air traffic control procedures.<a id="FNanchor_A13-310" href="#Footnote_A13-310" class="fnanchor">A13-310</a>
This course, as well as his next training assignment at Keesler Air
Force Base, required Oswald to deal with confidential material.<a id="FNanchor_A13-311" href="#Footnote_A13-311" class="fnanchor">A13-311</a> He
was granted final clearance up to the “confidential” level on May 3,
“after [a] careful check of local records had disclosed no derogatory
data.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-312" href="#Footnote_A13-312" class="fnanchor">A13-312</a> He completed the course on the same day, ranking 46th in
a class of 54 students.<a id="FNanchor_A13-313" href="#Footnote_A13-313" class="fnanchor">A13-313</a> On the previous day, he had been promoted
to private, first class, effective May 1.<a id="FNanchor_A13-314" href="#Footnote_A13-314" class="fnanchor">A13-314</a> At Jacksonville, he received
ratings of 4.7 in conduct and 4.5 in proficiency, the highest ratings
he ever attained.<a id="FNanchor_A13-315" href="#Footnote_A13-315" class="fnanchor">A13-315</a></p>

<p>Oswald left for Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss., on the day
his course was completed;<a id="FNanchor_A13-316" href="#Footnote_A13-316" class="fnanchor">A13-316</a> he traveled, probably by overnight train,
in a group of six marines led by Pfc. Daniel P. Powers, the senior
marine in charge.<a id="FNanchor_A13-317" href="#Footnote_A13-317" class="fnanchor">A13-317</a> At Keesler, he attended the Aircraft Control and
Warning Operator Course, which included instruction in aircraft surveillance
and the use of radar.<a id="FNanchor_A13-318" href="#Footnote_A13-318" class="fnanchor">A13-318</a> Powers was not sure whether he had
met Oswald before the trip to Biloxi<a id="FNanchor_A13-319" href="#Footnote_A13-319" class="fnanchor">A13-319</a> but remembers him there as “a
somewhat younger individual, less matured than the other boys,” who
“was normally outside the particular group of marines that were in
this attachment to Keesler.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-320" href="#Footnote_A13-320" class="fnanchor">A13-320</a> (Oswald was in fact 3 years younger
than Powers.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-321" href="#Footnote_A13-321" class="fnanchor">A13-321</a> Powers testified that Oswald had the nickname
“Ozzie Rabbit.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-322" href="#Footnote_A13-322" class="fnanchor">A13-322</a> Oswald generally stayed to himself, often reading;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_683">683</span>
he did not play cards or work out in the gym with the others.<a id="FNanchor_A13-323" href="#Footnote_A13-323" class="fnanchor">A13-323</a>
He spent his weekends alone, away from the base; Powers thought
he left Biloxi and perhaps went “home” to New Orleans, less than
100 miles away.<a id="FNanchor_A13-324" href="#Footnote_A13-324" class="fnanchor">A13-324</a> He finished the course seventh in a class of 30
marines on June 17,<a id="FNanchor_A13-325" href="#Footnote_A13-325" class="fnanchor">A13-325</a> and on June 25, was given an MOS (military
occupational specialty) of Aviation Electronics Operator.<a id="FNanchor_A13-326" href="#Footnote_A13-326" class="fnanchor">A13-326</a> On
June 20, he went on leave,<a id="FNanchor_A13-327" href="#Footnote_A13-327" class="fnanchor">A13-327</a> possibly visiting his mother.<a id="FNanchor_A13-328" href="#Footnote_A13-328" class="fnanchor">A13-328</a> His
ratings at Keesler were 4.2 in conduct and 4.5 in proficiency,<a id="FNanchor_A13-329" href="#Footnote_A13-329" class="fnanchor">A13-329</a> which
Powers thought was “pretty good.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-330" href="#Footnote_A13-330" class="fnanchor">A13-330</a></p>

<p>On July 9, Oswald reported at the Marine Corps Air Station at El
Toro, Calif., near Santa Ana.<a id="FNanchor_A13-331" href="#Footnote_A13-331" class="fnanchor">A13-331</a> He was classified as a replacement
trainee and attached to the Fourth Replacement Battalion.<a id="FNanchor_A13-332" href="#Footnote_A13-332" class="fnanchor">A13-332</a> Six
weeks later, on August 22, he departed from San Diego for Yokosuka,
Japan, on board the U.S.S. <i>Bexar</i>.<a id="FNanchor_A13-333" href="#Footnote_A13-333" class="fnanchor">A13-333</a> Powers testified that while on
board, Oswald taught him to play chess, which they played frequently,
sometimes for more than 4 hours a day.<a id="FNanchor_A13-334" href="#Footnote_A13-334" class="fnanchor">A13-334</a> Like most of the men on
board, Oswald read a lot from the books which were available.
Powers thought he read “a good type of literature,” remembering
in particular Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-335" href="#Footnote_A13-335" class="fnanchor">A13-335</a></p>

<p>The <i>Bexar</i> docked at Yokosuka on September 12.<a id="FNanchor_A13-336" href="#Footnote_A13-336" class="fnanchor">A13-336</a> Oswald was
assigned to Marine Air Control Squadron No. 1 (MACS-1), Marine
Air Group 11, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, based at Atsugi, about 20
miles west of Tokyo.<a id="FNanchor_A13-337" href="#Footnote_A13-337" class="fnanchor">A13-337</a> Oswald was a radar operator in MACS-1,
which had less than 100 men.<a id="FNanchor_A13-338" href="#Footnote_A13-338" class="fnanchor">A13-338</a> Its function was to direct aircraft to
their targets by radar, communicating with the pilots by radio.<a id="FNanchor_A13-339" href="#Footnote_A13-339" class="fnanchor">A13-339</a>
The squadron had also the duty of scouting for incoming foreign aircraft,
such as straying Russian or Chinese planes, which would be
intercepted by American planes.<a id="FNanchor_A13-340" href="#Footnote_A13-340" class="fnanchor">A13-340</a></p>

<p>On October 27, when Oswald opened his locker to remove some
gear, a derringer .22 caliber pistol fell to the floor and discharged; the
bullet hit him in the left elbow.<a id="FNanchor_A13-341" href="#Footnote_A13-341" class="fnanchor">A13-341</a> Paul Edward Murphy, a fellow
marine who was in the next cubicle, heard the shot, rushed in, and
found Oswald sitting on the locker looking at his arm; without emotion,
Oswald said to Murphy, “I believe I shot myself.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-342" href="#Footnote_A13-342" class="fnanchor">A13-342</a> He was
in the naval hospital at Yokosuka until November 15.<a id="FNanchor_A13-343" href="#Footnote_A13-343" class="fnanchor">A13-343</a></p>

<p>The Judge Advocate General concluded that Oswald had “displayed
a certain degree of carelessness or negligence” by storing a
loaded revolver in his locker, but that his injury was incurred “in
the line of duty” and was not the result “of his own misconduct.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-344" href="#Footnote_A13-344" class="fnanchor">A13-344</a>
He was, however, charged with possession of an unregistered privately
owned weapon in violation of general orders. A court-martial followed
on April 11, 1958, when Oswald’s unit returned from maneuvers,
and on April 29 he was sentenced to be confined at hard labor for 20
days, to forfeit $25 per month for 2 months, and to be reduced to the
grade of private.<a id="FNanchor_A13-345" href="#Footnote_A13-345" class="fnanchor">A13-345</a> The confinement was suspended for 6 months,
after which that portion of the sentence was to be remitted.<a id="FNanchor_A13-346" href="#Footnote_A13-346" class="fnanchor">A13-346</a></p>

<p>Five days after Oswald left the hospital, MACS-1 embarked aboard
the <i>Terrell County</i>, LST 1157, for maneuvers in the Philippine Islands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_684">684</span>
area,<a id="FNanchor_A13-347" href="#Footnote_A13-347" class="fnanchor">A13-347</a> According to Powers’ recollection, the squadron was
expected to return to Atsugi after maneuvers were completed, but an
international crisis developed; since another operation was scheduled
for a few months later, the squadron debarked at Cubi Point (Subic
Bay) in the Philippines and set up a temporary installation.<a id="FNanchor_A13-348" href="#Footnote_A13-348" class="fnanchor">A13-348</a>
While he was in the Philippines, Oswald passed a test of eligibility
for the rank of corporal;<a id="FNanchor_A13-349" href="#Footnote_A13-349" class="fnanchor">A13-349</a> in a semiannual evaluation, however, he
was given his lowest ratings thus far: 4.0 in conduct and 3.9 in proficiency.<a id="FNanchor_A13-350" href="#Footnote_A13-350" class="fnanchor">A13-350</a>
The unit participated in exercises at Corregidor, from
which it sailed for Atsugi on March 7, 1958, aboard the U.S.S. <i>Wexford
County</i>, LST 1168.<a id="FNanchor_A13-351" href="#Footnote_A13-351" class="fnanchor">A13-351</a> The <i>Wexford County</i> reached Atsugi 11
days later.<a id="FNanchor_A13-352" href="#Footnote_A13-352" class="fnanchor">A13-352</a></p>

<p>Oswald was court-martialed a second time on June 27, for using
“provoking words” to a noncommissioned officer (a sergeant) on
June 20, at the Bluebird Cafe in Yamato, and assaulting the officer by
pouring a drink on him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-353" href="#Footnote_A13-353" class="fnanchor">A13-353</a> The findings were that Oswald spilled the
drink accidentally, but when the sergeant shoved him away, Oswald
invited the sergeant outside in insulting language.<a id="FNanchor_A13-354" href="#Footnote_A13-354" class="fnanchor">A13-354</a> Oswald admitted
that he was rather drunk and had invited the sergeant outside but did
not recall insulting him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-355" href="#Footnote_A13-355" class="fnanchor">A13-355</a> He was sentenced to be confined at hard
labor for 28 days and to forfeit $55;<a id="FNanchor_A13-356" href="#Footnote_A13-356" class="fnanchor">A13-356</a> in addition, suspension of the
previous sentence of confinement was withdrawn.<a id="FNanchor_A13-357" href="#Footnote_A13-357" class="fnanchor">A13-357</a> He was in confinement
until August 13.<a id="FNanchor_A13-358" href="#Footnote_A13-358" class="fnanchor">A13-358</a> Meanwhile, a previously granted extension
of oversea duty was canceled,<a id="FNanchor_A13-359" href="#Footnote_A13-359" class="fnanchor">A13-359</a> and he was given ratings of 1.9 in
conduct and 3.4 in proficiency.<a id="FNanchor_A13-360" href="#Footnote_A13-360" class="fnanchor">A13-360</a></p>

<p>On September 14, Oswald sailed with his unit for the South China
Sea area; the unit was at Ping Tung, North Taiwan on September 30,
and returned to Atsugi on October 5.<a id="FNanchor_A13-361" href="#Footnote_A13-361" class="fnanchor">A13-361</a> On October 6, he was transferred
out of MACS-1 and put on general duty, in anticipation of his
return to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-362" href="#Footnote_A13-362" class="fnanchor">A13-362</a> He spent several days thereafter in
the Atsugi Station Hospital.<a id="FNanchor_A13-363" href="#Footnote_A13-363" class="fnanchor">A13-363</a> On October 31, he received his last
oversea ratings: 4.0 in both conduct and proficiency.<a id="FNanchor_A13-364" href="#Footnote_A13-364" class="fnanchor">A13-364</a></p>

<p>Oswald appears generally to have been regarded by his fellows
overseas as an intelligent person who followed orders and did his work
well, but who complained frequently.<a id="FNanchor_A13-365" href="#Footnote_A13-365" class="fnanchor">A13-365</a> He did not associate much
with other marines and continued to read a great deal.<a id="FNanchor_A13-366" href="#Footnote_A13-366" class="fnanchor">A13-366</a> Paul
Murphy testified that Oswald could speak “a little Russian” while he
was overseas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-367" href="#Footnote_A13-367" class="fnanchor">A13-367</a> Powers believed that Oswald became more assertive
in Japan and thought that he might have had a Japanese girl friend.<a id="FNanchor_A13-368" href="#Footnote_A13-368" class="fnanchor">A13-368</a>
He departed from Yokosuka on board the USNS <i>Barrett</i> on November
2, and arrived in San Francisco 13 days later.<a id="FNanchor_A13-369" href="#Footnote_A13-369" class="fnanchor">A13-369</a> On November 19,
he took 30 days’ leave.<a id="FNanchor_A13-370" href="#Footnote_A13-370" class="fnanchor">A13-370</a></p>

<p>On December 22, Oswald was assigned to Marine Air Control
Squadron No. 9 (MACS-9) at the Marine Corps Air Station at El
Toro, where he had been briefly before he went overseas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-371" href="#Footnote_A13-371" class="fnanchor">A13-371</a> He was
one of about seven enlisted men and three officers who formed a
“radar crew,” engaged primarily in aircraft surveillance.<a id="FNanchor_A13-372" href="#Footnote_A13-372" class="fnanchor">A13-372</a> This
work probably gave him access to certain kinds of classified material,
some of which, such as aircraft call signs and radio frequencies, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_685">685</span>
changed after his defection to Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-373" href="#Footnote_A13-373" class="fnanchor">A13-373</a> For part of his time at
El Toro, Oswald may have been assigned to clerical or janitorial
tasks on the base.<a id="FNanchor_A13-374" href="#Footnote_A13-374" class="fnanchor">A13-374</a> Some of his associates believed rumors,<a id="FNanchor_A13-375" href="#Footnote_A13-375" class="fnanchor">A13-375</a> incorrect
according to official records,<a id="FNanchor_A13-376" href="#Footnote_A13-376" class="fnanchor">A13-376</a> that he had lost his clearance to
work on radar crews; one recalled hearing that Oswald had once had
clearance above the “confidential” level and had lost it because he
“had poured beer over a staff NCO’s head in an enlisted club in
Japan, and had been put in the brig.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-377" href="#Footnote_A13-377" class="fnanchor">A13-377</a></p>

<p>The officer in command of the radar crew, Lt. John E. Donovan,
found him “competent in all functions,” and observed that he handled
himself calmly and well in emergency situations.<a id="FNanchor_A13-378" href="#Footnote_A13-378" class="fnanchor">A13-378</a> Donovan thought
Oswald was not a leader but that he performed competently on occasions
when, as the senior man present, he served as crew chief.<a id="FNanchor_A13-379" href="#Footnote_A13-379" class="fnanchor">A13-379</a> This
estimate was generally shared by his fellows, most of whom thought
that he performed his assigned duties adequately but was deficient in
disciplinary matters and such things as barracks inspection.<a id="FNanchor_A13-380" href="#Footnote_A13-380" class="fnanchor">A13-380</a> One of
them recalled that after a number of bad inspections, the other members
of Oswald’s quonset hut complained about him and secured his
transfer to another hut.<a id="FNanchor_A13-381" href="#Footnote_A13-381" class="fnanchor">A13-381</a> He was thought to be an intelligent person,
somewhat better educated and more intellectually oriented than other
men on the base.<a id="FNanchor_A13-382" href="#Footnote_A13-382" class="fnanchor">A13-382</a> A few of the men thought it more accurate to
describe him as someone who wanted to appear intelligent.<a id="FNanchor_A13-383" href="#Footnote_A13-383" class="fnanchor">A13-383</a> He had
a pronounced interest in world affairs, in which he appears to have
been better informed than some of the officers, whose lack of knowledge
amused and sometimes irritated him; he evidently enjoyed drawing
others, especially officers, into conversations in which he could
display his own superior knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_A13-384" href="#Footnote_A13-384" class="fnanchor">A13-384</a></p>

<p>It seems clear from the various recollections of those who knew him
at El Toro that by the time Oswald returned to the United States,
he no longer had any spirit for the Marines; the attitudes which had
prompted his enlistment as soon as he was eligible were entirely gone,
and his attention had turned away from the Marines to what he might
do after his discharge. While no one was able to predict his attempt
to defect to Russia within a month after he left the Marines, the testimony
of those who knew him at El Toro, in contrast to that of his
associates in Japan, leaves no doubt that his thoughts were occupied
increasingly with Russia and the Russian way of life. He had studied
the Russian language enough by February 25, 1959, to request that
he be given a foreign language qualification test; his rating was
“poor” in all parts of the test.<a id="FNanchor_A13-385" href="#Footnote_A13-385" class="fnanchor">A13-385</a> Most of the marines who knew him
were aware that he was studying Russian;<a id="FNanchor_A13-386" href="#Footnote_A13-386" class="fnanchor">A13-386</a> one of them, Henry J.
Roussel, Jr., arranged a date between Lee and his aunt, Rosaleen
Quinn, an airline stewardess who was also studying Russian.<a id="FNanchor_A13-387" href="#Footnote_A13-387" class="fnanchor">A13-387</a> (Miss
Quinn thought that Oswald spoke Russian well in view of his lack
of formal training; she found the evening uninteresting.<a id="FNanchor_A13-388" href="#Footnote_A13-388" class="fnanchor">A13-388</a> Donovan,
with whom she had a date later, testified that she told him that Oswald
was “kind of an oddball.”)<a id="FNanchor_A13-389" href="#Footnote_A13-389" class="fnanchor">A13-389</a> He read, and perhaps subscribed to,
a newspaper, possibly printed in Russian, which his associates connected
with his Russian bent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_686">686</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-390" href="#Footnote_A13-390" class="fnanchor">A13-390</a></p>

<p>Most of those who knew him were able to recount anecdotes which
suggest that he was anxious to publicize his liking for things Russian,
sometimes in good humor and sometimes seriously. Some of his
fellows called him “Oswaldskovich,” apparently to his pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_A13-391" href="#Footnote_A13-391" class="fnanchor">A13-391</a> He
is said to have had his name written in Russian on one of his jackets;<a id="FNanchor_A13-392" href="#Footnote_A13-392" class="fnanchor">A13-392</a>
to have played records of Russian songs “so loud that one
could hear them outside the barracks”;<a id="FNanchor_A13-393" href="#Footnote_A13-393" class="fnanchor">A13-393</a> frequently to have made
remarks in Russian<a id="FNanchor_A13-394" href="#Footnote_A13-394" class="fnanchor">A13-394</a> or used expressions like “da” or “nyet,”<a id="FNanchor_A13-395" href="#Footnote_A13-395" class="fnanchor">A13-395</a> or
addressed others (and been addressed) as “Comrade”;<a id="FNanchor_A13-396" href="#Footnote_A13-396" class="fnanchor">A13-396</a> to have come
over and said jokingly, “You called?” when one of the marines played
a particular record of Russian music.<a id="FNanchor_A13-397" href="#Footnote_A13-397" class="fnanchor">A13-397</a></p>

<p>Connected with this Russophilia was an interest in and acceptance
of Russian political views and, to a lesser extent, Communist
ideology. Less obvious to his fellows generally,<a id="FNanchor_A13-398" href="#Footnote_A13-398" class="fnanchor">A13-398</a> it nevertheless
led him into serious discussions with some of them. Donovan, who
was a graduate of the School of Foreign Service of Georgetown
University,<a id="FNanchor_A13-399" href="#Footnote_A13-399" class="fnanchor">A13-399</a> thought Oswald was “truly interested in international affairs”<a id="FNanchor_A13-400" href="#Footnote_A13-400" class="fnanchor">A13-400</a>
and “very well versed, at least on the superficial facts of a
given foreign situation.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-401" href="#Footnote_A13-401" class="fnanchor">A13-401</a> He recalled that Oswald had a particular
interest in Latin America<a id="FNanchor_A13-402" href="#Footnote_A13-402" class="fnanchor">A13-402</a> and had a good deal of information about
Cuba in particular.<a id="FNanchor_A13-403" href="#Footnote_A13-403" class="fnanchor">A13-403</a> Oswald expressed sympathy for Castro but,
according to Donovan, “what he said about Castro was not an unpopular
belief at that time.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-404" href="#Footnote_A13-404" class="fnanchor">A13-404</a> Donovan believed that Oswald subscribed
to the Russian newspaper—which Donovan thought was a Communist
newspaper—not only in order to read Russian but also because he
thought it “presented a very different and perhaps equally just side of
the international affairs in comparison with the United States newspapers.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-405" href="#Footnote_A13-405" class="fnanchor">A13-405</a>
Donovan was clear, on the other hand, that he never heard
Oswald “in any way, shape or form confess that he was a Communist,
or that he ever thought about being a Communist.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-406" href="#Footnote_A13-406" class="fnanchor">A13-406</a></p>

<p>Private Kerry Thornley described himself as a close acquaintance,
but not a good friend, of Oswald, whom he met in the spring of 1959;<a id="FNanchor_A13-407" href="#Footnote_A13-407" class="fnanchor">A13-407</a>
he later wrote an unpublished novel in which he drew heavily on his
impressions of Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A13-408" href="#Footnote_A13-408" class="fnanchor">A13-408</a> Thornley generally corroborates Donovan’s
testimony but thought Oswald definitely believed that “the Marxist
morality was the most rational morality to follow” and communism,
“the best system in the world.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-409" href="#Footnote_A13-409" class="fnanchor">A13-409</a> Thornley thought this belief was
“theoretical,” a “dispassionate appraisal” which did not indicate “any
active commitment to the Communist ends”; he described Oswald as
“idle in his admiration for communism.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-410" href="#Footnote_A13-410" class="fnanchor">A13-410</a> He recalled discussions
about Marxism in which Oswald criticized capitalism and praised the
Soviet economic system.<a id="FNanchor_A13-411" href="#Footnote_A13-411" class="fnanchor">A13-411</a> Thornley testified that his association with
Oswald ended when, in response to Oswald’s criticism of a parade in
which they both had to march, he said “Well, comes the revolution you
will change all that.” Oswald, he said, looked at him “like a betrayed
Caesar” and walked away.<a id="FNanchor_A13-412" href="#Footnote_A13-412" class="fnanchor">A13-412</a> Thornley attributed Oswald’s decision
to go to Russia to a growing disillusionment with the United States,
especially its role in the Far East, and a conviction that communism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_687">687</span>
would eventually prevail.<a id="FNanchor_A13-413" href="#Footnote_A13-413" class="fnanchor">A13-413</a> He was surprised by the decision but
expected Oswald to adjust to Russian life and remain in Russia
permanently.<a id="FNanchor_A13-414" href="#Footnote_A13-414" class="fnanchor">A13-414</a></p>

<p>Another marine, Nelson Delgado, met Oswald soon after the latter
arrived at El Toro.<a id="FNanchor_A13-415" href="#Footnote_A13-415" class="fnanchor">A13-415</a> They were about the same age and had similar
interests; Oswald enjoyed trying to speak Spanish with Delgado,
who spoke it fluently.<a id="FNanchor_A13-416" href="#Footnote_A13-416" class="fnanchor">A13-416</a> Delgado regarded him as a “complete believer
that our way of government was not quite right,” but did not
think he was a Communist.<a id="FNanchor_A13-417" href="#Footnote_A13-417" class="fnanchor">A13-417</a> Their discussions were concerned more
with Cuba than Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-418" href="#Footnote_A13-418" class="fnanchor">A13-418</a> They both favored the Castro government
and talked—“dreaming,” Delgado said—about joining the Cuban
Army or Government and perhaps leading expeditions to other Caribbean
islands to “free them too.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-419" href="#Footnote_A13-419" class="fnanchor">A13-419</a> Oswald told Delgado that he was
in touch with Cuban diplomatic officials in this country; which Delgado
at first took to be “one of his * * * lies,”<a id="FNanchor_A13-420" href="#Footnote_A13-420" class="fnanchor">A13-420</a> but later believed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-421" href="#Footnote_A13-421" class="fnanchor">A13-421</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s interest in Russia and developing ideological attachment to
theoretical communism apparently dominated his stay at El Toro. He
was still withdrawn from most of his fellows, although his special interests
appear to have made him stand out more there than he had at
other posts and to have given him a source for conversation which he
had hitherto lacked.<a id="FNanchor_A13-422" href="#Footnote_A13-422" class="fnanchor">A13-422</a> According to several of the witnesses, names
like “Ozzie Rabbit” still clung to him;<a id="FNanchor_A13-423" href="#Footnote_A13-423" class="fnanchor">A13-423</a> others recalled no nickname
or only shortened versions of his real name.<a id="FNanchor_A13-424" href="#Footnote_A13-424" class="fnanchor">A13-424</a> His reading acquired
direction; books like “Das Kapital” and Orwell’s “Animal Farm” and
“1984” are mentioned in the testimony concerning this period.<a id="FNanchor_A13-425" href="#Footnote_A13-425" class="fnanchor">A13-425</a> He
played chess;<a id="FNanchor_A13-426" href="#Footnote_A13-426" class="fnanchor">A13-426</a> according to one of his opponents he chose the red
pieces, expressing a preference for the “Red Army.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-427" href="#Footnote_A13-427" class="fnanchor">A13-427</a> He listened to
classical music.<a id="FNanchor_A13-428" href="#Footnote_A13-428" class="fnanchor">A13-428</a> For a short time, he played on the squadron football
team.<a id="FNanchor_A13-429" href="#Footnote_A13-429" class="fnanchor">A13-429</a> According to Donovan, who coached the team, Oswald
was not very good; he lacked team spirit and often tried to call the
plays, which was not his job.<a id="FNanchor_A13-430" href="#Footnote_A13-430" class="fnanchor">A13-430</a> Delgado thought Oswald was a mediocre
player.<a id="FNanchor_A13-431" href="#Footnote_A13-431" class="fnanchor">A13-431</a> Donovan did not know whether Oswald quit or was
thrown off the team.<a id="FNanchor_A13-432" href="#Footnote_A13-432" class="fnanchor">A13-432</a> He spent most of his weekends alone, as he had
at Keesler, and did not leave the post as often as the other men.<a id="FNanchor_A13-433" href="#Footnote_A13-433" class="fnanchor">A13-433</a>
Delgado once rode with him on the train to Los Angeles but separated
from him there; Oswald returned to the base after one night.<a id="FNanchor_A13-434" href="#Footnote_A13-434" class="fnanchor">A13-434</a> Delgado
recalls that on another weekend Oswald accepted his invitation
to go to Tijuana: they stayed there for one night.<a id="FNanchor_A13-435" href="#Footnote_A13-435" class="fnanchor">A13-435</a></p>

<p>At the end of January 1959 and at the end of July, Oswald was
given his semiannual ratings, scoring 4.0 in conduct both times, and
4.0 and 4.2 in proficiency.<a id="FNanchor_A13-436" href="#Footnote_A13-436" class="fnanchor">A13-436</a> (The July ratings were repeated in September,
when he was transferred from MACS-9 in preparation for
his discharge.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-437" href="#Footnote_A13-437" class="fnanchor">A13-437</a> On March 9, he was promoted as of March 1, to
the rank of private, first class, for the second time.<a id="FNanchor_A13-438" href="#Footnote_A13-438" class="fnanchor">A13-438</a> He took a
series of high school level general educational development tests on
March 23 and received an overall rating of “satisfactory.” His best
scores, in the 76th and 79th U.S. percentiles, were in English composition
and physical sciences; his worst was English literature, in
which he placed in the 34th percentile.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_688">688</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-439" href="#Footnote_A13-439" class="fnanchor">A13-439</a></p>

<p>In the spring, Oswald applied to Albert Schweitzer College in
Churwalden, Switzerland, for admission to the spring term in 1960;
the application is dated March 19.<a id="FNanchor_A13-440" href="#Footnote_A13-440" class="fnanchor">A13-440</a> Schweitzer is a small school,
which specializes in courses in religion, ethics, science, and literature.
He claimed a proficiency in Russian equal to 1 year of schooling<a id="FNanchor_A13-441" href="#Footnote_A13-441" class="fnanchor">A13-441</a>
and that he had completed high school by correspondence with an
average grade of 85 percent.<a id="FNanchor_A13-442" href="#Footnote_A13-442" class="fnanchor">A13-442</a> He listed philosophy, psychology,
ideology, football, baseball, tennis and stamp-collecting as special interests,
and writing short stories “on contemporary American life” as
his vocational interest.<a id="FNanchor_A13-443" href="#Footnote_A13-443" class="fnanchor">A13-443</a> Jack London, Charles Darwin, and Norman
Vincent Peale were listed as favorite authors.<a id="FNanchor_A13-444" href="#Footnote_A13-444" class="fnanchor">A13-444</a> He claimed membership
in the YMCA and the “A.Y.H. Association,” and said that he
had participated in a “student body movement in school” for the control
of juvenile delinquency.<a id="FNanchor_A13-445" href="#Footnote_A13-445" class="fnanchor">A13-445</a> Asked to give a general statement of
his reasons for wanting to attend the college, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In order to aquire a fuller understanding of that subject which
interest me most, Philosophy. To meet with Europeans who can
broaden my scope of understanding. To receive formal Education
by Instructers of high standing and character. To broaden
my knowlege of German and to live in a healty climate and Good
moral atmosphere.<a id="FNanchor_A13-446" href="#Footnote_A13-446" class="fnanchor">A13-446</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">On the basis of these representations, Oswald’s application was approved
by the college.<a id="FNanchor_A13-447" href="#Footnote_A13-447" class="fnanchor">A13-447</a> He enclosed a registration fee of $25 in a
letter dated June 19, in which he said that he was “looking forward
to a fine stay.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-448" href="#Footnote_A13-448" class="fnanchor">A13-448</a> Few of the other marines seem to have known about
this application. He told Delgado, however, that he planned to attend
a Swiss school to study psychology, and Delgado knew that some
application had been made.<a id="FNanchor_A13-449" href="#Footnote_A13-449" class="fnanchor">A13-449</a> Another marine, Richard Call, also
knew something of his plans.<a id="FNanchor_A13-450" href="#Footnote_A13-450" class="fnanchor">A13-450</a></p>

<p>Oswald was obligated to serve on active duty until December 7,
1959 (the date having been adjusted to compensate for the period of
confinement),<a id="FNanchor_A13-451" href="#Footnote_A13-451" class="fnanchor">A13-451</a> On August 17, he submitted a request for a dependency
discharge, on the ground that his mother needed his support.<a id="FNanchor_A13-452" href="#Footnote_A13-452" class="fnanchor">A13-452</a>
The request was accompanied by an affidavit of Mrs. Oswald and corroborating
affidavits from an attorney, a doctor, and two friends,
attesting that she had been injured at work in December 1958, and
was unable to support herself.<a id="FNanchor_A13-453" href="#Footnote_A13-453" class="fnanchor">A13-453</a> Oswald had previously made a voluntary
allotment of part of his salary to his mother, under which
arrangement she received $40 in August, and had submitted an application
for a “Q” allotment (dependency allowance) in her behalf
of $91.30; one payment of the “Q” allotment, for the month of August,
was made in September.<a id="FNanchor_A13-454" href="#Footnote_A13-454" class="fnanchor">A13-454</a> On August 28, the Wing Hardship or
Dependency Discharge Board recommended that Oswald’s request for
a discharge be approved;<a id="FNanchor_A13-455" href="#Footnote_A13-455" class="fnanchor">A13-455</a> approval followed shortly.<a id="FNanchor_A13-456" href="#Footnote_A13-456" class="fnanchor">A13-456</a> On September
4, he was transferred from MACS-9 to the H. &amp; H. Squadron,<a id="FNanchor_A13-457" href="#Footnote_A13-457" class="fnanchor">A13-457</a>
and on September 11, he was released from active duty and
transferred to the Marine Corps Reserve, in which he was expected to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_689">689</span>
serve until December 8, 1962.<a id="FNanchor_A13-458" href="#Footnote_A13-458" class="fnanchor">A13-458</a> He was assigned to the Marine Air
Reserve Training Command at the Naval Air Station in Glenview,
Ill.<a id="FNanchor_A13-459" href="#Footnote_A13-459" class="fnanchor">A13-459</a></p>

<p>Almost exactly 1 year later, on September 13, 1960, Oswald was
given an “undesirable discharge” from the Marine Corps Reserve,<a id="FNanchor_A13-460" href="#Footnote_A13-460" class="fnanchor">A13-460</a>
based on:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">reliable information which indicated that he had renounced
his U.S. citizenship with the intentions of becoming a permanent
citizen of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Further, that
petitioner brought discredit to the Marine Corps through adverse
newspaper publicity, which was generated by the foregoing action,
and had thereby, in the opinion of his commanding officer,
proved himself unfit for retention in the naval service.<a id="FNanchor_A13-461" href="#Footnote_A13-461" class="fnanchor">A13-461</a></p></blockquote>

<h3 id="hdr245">SOVIET UNION</h3>

<p>On September 4, the day on which he was transferred out of
MACS-9 in preparation for his discharge, Oswald had applied for a
passport at the Superior Court of Santa Ana, Calif. His application
stated that he planned to leave the United States on September 21 to
attend the Albert Schweitzer College and the University of Turku in
Finland, and to travel in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, England,
France, Germany, and Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-462" href="#Footnote_A13-462" class="fnanchor">A13-462</a> The passport was routinely issued
6 days later.<a id="FNanchor_A13-463" href="#Footnote_A13-463" class="fnanchor">A13-463</a></p>

<p>Oswald went directly home after his discharge, and arrived in Fort
Worth by September 14.<a id="FNanchor_A13-464" href="#Footnote_A13-464" class="fnanchor">A13-464</a> He told his mother that he intended to get
a job on a ship or possibly in the “export-import business.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-465" href="#Footnote_A13-465" class="fnanchor">A13-465</a> If he
stayed in Fort Worth, he said, he would be able to earn only about

send substantial amounts home.<a id="FNanchor_A13-466" href="#Footnote_A13-466" class="fnanchor">A13-466</a> Three days after he arrived in
Fort Worth, he left for New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_A13-467" href="#Footnote_A13-467" class="fnanchor">A13-467</a> While he was in Fort Worth
he had registered his dependency discharge and entry into the Marine

brother Robert and his family.<a id="FNanchor_A13-469" href="#Footnote_A13-469" class="fnanchor">A13-469</a> He also gave his mother $100.<a id="FNanchor_A13-470" href="#Footnote_A13-470" class="fnanchor">A13-470</a></p>

<p>On September 17, Oswald spoke with a representative of
Travel Consultants, Inc., a New Orleans travel bureau; he
filled out a “Passenger Immigration Questionnaire,” on which he gave
his occupation as “shipping export agent” and said that he would be
abroad for 2 months on a pleasure trip. He booked passage from
New Orleans to Le Havre, France, on a freighter, the SS <i>Marion Lykes</i>,
scheduled to sail on September 18, for which he paid $220.75.<a id="FNanchor_A13-471" href="#Footnote_A13-471" class="fnanchor">A13-471</a> On
the evening of September 17, he registered at the Liberty Hotel.<a id="FNanchor_A13-472" href="#Footnote_A13-472" class="fnanchor">A13-472</a></p>

<p>The <i>Marion Lykes</i> did not sail until the early morning of September
20.<a id="FNanchor_A13-473" href="#Footnote_A13-473" class="fnanchor">A13-473</a> Before its departure, Oswald wrote his mother a letter,
which was her last news of him until she read stories of his defection
in Fort Worth newspapers:</p>

<p>The <i>Marion Lykes</i> carried only four passengers.<a id="FNanchor_A13-475" href="#Footnote_A13-475" class="fnanchor">A13-475</a> Oswald shared
his cabin with Billy Joe Lord, a young man who had just graduated
from high school and was going to France to continue his education.
Lord testified that he and Oswald did not discuss politics but did have
a few amicable religious arguments, in which Oswald defended
atheism. Oswald was “standoffish,” but told Lord generally about
his background, mentioning that his mother worked in a drugstore
in Fort Worth and that he was bitter about the low wages which
she received. He told Lord that he intended to travel in Europe and
possibly to attend school in Sweden or Switzerland if he had sufficient
funds.<a id="FNanchor_A13-476" href="#Footnote_A13-476" class="fnanchor">A13-476</a> The other two passengers were Lt. Col. and Mrs. George B.
Church, Jr., who also found Oswald unfriendly and had little contact
with him. Oswald told them that he had not liked the Marine Corps
and that he planned to study in Switzerland; they observed some
“bitterness” about his mother’s difficulties, but did not discuss this
with him. No one on board suspected that he intended to defect to
Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-477" href="#Footnote_A13-477" class="fnanchor">A13-477</a></p>

<p>Oswald disembarked at Le Havre on October 8. He left for England
that same day, and arrived on October 9.<a id="FNanchor_A13-478" href="#Footnote_A13-478" class="fnanchor">A13-478</a> He told English
customs officials in Southampton that he had $700 and planned to
remain in the United Kingdom for 1 week before proceeding to a
school in Switzerland. But on the same day, he flew to Helsinki, Finland,
where he registered at the Torni Hotel; on the following day,
he moved to the Klaus Kurki Hotel.<a id="FNanchor_A13-479" href="#Footnote_A13-479" class="fnanchor">A13-479</a></p>

<p>Oswald probably applied for a visa at the Russian consulate on
October 12, his first business day in Helsinki.<a id="FNanchor_A13-480" href="#Footnote_A13-480" class="fnanchor">A13-480</a> The visa was issued
on October 14. It was valid until October 20 and permitted him to
take one trip of not more than 6 days to the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_A13-481" href="#Footnote_A13-481" class="fnanchor">A13-481</a> He also
purchased 10 Soviet “tourist vouchers” which cost $30 apiece.<a id="FNanchor_A13-482" href="#Footnote_A13-482" class="fnanchor">A13-482</a> He
left Helsinki by train on the following day, crossed the Finnish-Russian
border at Vainikkala, and arrived in Moscow on October 16.<a id="FNanchor_A13-483" href="#Footnote_A13-483" class="fnanchor">A13-483</a></p>

<p>He was met at the Moscow railroad station by a representative
of “Intourist,” the state tourist agency, and taken to the Hotel Berlin,
where he registered as a student.<a id="FNanchor_A13-484" href="#Footnote_A13-484" class="fnanchor">A13-484</a> On the same day he met the
Intourist guide assigned to him during his stay in Russia,
a young woman named Rima Shirokova. They went sightseeing
the next day. Almost immediately he told her that he wanted to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_691">691</span>
the United States and become a citizen of the Soviet Union. According
to Oswald’s “Historic Diary,” she later told him that she
had reported his statement to Intourist headquarters, which in turn
had notified the “Passport and Visa Office” (probably the Visa and
Registration Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the
MVD<a id="FNanchor_A13-485" href="#Footnote_A13-485" class="fnanchor">A13-485</a>). She was instructed to help Oswald prepare a letter to the
Supreme Soviet requesting that he be granted citizenship. Oswald
mailed such a letter that same day.<a id="FNanchor_A13-486" href="#Footnote_A13-486" class="fnanchor">A13-486</a> (The “Historic Diary” is
Oswald’s handwritten account of his life in Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-487" href="#Footnote_A13-487" class="fnanchor">A13-487</a> The earlier
entries were written after the events which they describe; later, in
Minsk, he probably kept a contemporaneous record of his experiences.<a id="FNanchor_A13-488" href="#Footnote_A13-488" class="fnanchor">A13-488</a>
The Commission has used the diary, which Oswald may have
written with future readers in mind, only as Oswald’s record of his
private life and personal impressions as he sought to present them
and has relied wherever possible on official documents, correspondence,
and the testimony of witnesses.)</p>

<p>The diary records that when Oswald told Rima Shirokova that he
intended to defect she was “flabbergassted,” but agreeed to help.<a id="FNanchor_A13-489" href="#Footnote_A13-489" class="fnanchor">A13-489</a> She
was “politly sympathetic but uneasy” when he told her that he
wanted to defect because he was “a Communist, ect.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-490" href="#Footnote_A13-490" class="fnanchor">A13-490</a> As an
Intourist guide, Rima toured parts of Moscow with Oswald in the
next few days. His primary concern, however, appeared to be his
effort to become a Soviet citizen, and she also aided him in his dealings
with the Soviet Government.<a id="FNanchor_A13-491" href="#Footnote_A13-491" class="fnanchor">A13-491</a> He thought that Rima felt sorry for
him and tried to be a friend because he was “someth. new.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-492" href="#Footnote_A13-492" class="fnanchor">A13-492</a> On
his 20th birthday, 2 days after he arrived in Russia, she gave him
Dostoevski’s “The Idiot,”<a id="FNanchor_A13-493" href="#Footnote_A13-493" class="fnanchor">A13-493</a> in which she had written: “Dear Lee,
Great congratulations! Let all your dreams come true! 18.X
1959”<a id="FNanchor_A13-494" href="#Footnote_A13-494" class="fnanchor">A13-494</a></p>

<p>On October 19, Oswald was probably interviewed in his hotel room
by a man named Lev Setyayev, who said that he was a reporter for
Radio Moscow seeking statements from American tourists about their
impressions of Moscow,<a id="FNanchor_A13-495" href="#Footnote_A13-495" class="fnanchor">A13-495</a> but who was probably also acting for the
KGB.<a id="FNanchor_A13-496" href="#Footnote_A13-496" class="fnanchor">A13-496</a> Two years later, Oswald told officials at the American
Embassy that he had made a few routine comments to Setyayev of no
political significance. The interview with Setyayev may, however,
have been the occasion for an attempt by the KGB, in accordance with
regular practice, to assess Oswald or even to elicit compromising statements
from him; the interview was apparently never broadcast.<a id="FNanchor_A13-497" href="#Footnote_A13-497" class="fnanchor">A13-497</a>
(As discussed in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">ch. VI</a> of this report, the Commission is
aware that many of the Soviet officials with whom Oswald came into
contact were employees of the KGB, the agency which has primary
jurisdiction for the treatment of defectors.)</p>

<p>On the following day, Rima Shirokova told him that the “Pass.
and Visa Dept.” wanted to see him,<a id="FNanchor_A13-498" href="#Footnote_A13-498" class="fnanchor">A13-498</a> and on the morning of October
21, he was interviewed by an official concerning his application for
citizenship. The official offered little information and no encouragement;
he told Oswald only that he would check to see if the visa could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_692">692</span>
be extended. Oswald returned to the Hotel Berlin.<a id="FNanchor_A13-499" href="#Footnote_A13-499" class="fnanchor">A13-499</a> That afternoon,
he was notified that his visa had expired and that he had to leave
Moscow within 2 hours.<a id="FNanchor_A13-500" href="#Footnote_A13-500" class="fnanchor">A13-500</a></p>

<p>Oswald responded to the unfavorable decision by cutting himself
above his left wrist, in an apparent suicide attempt. Rima Shirokova
found him unconscious in his hotel room and had him taken to the Botkinskaya
Hospital. His diary states: “Poor Rimmea stays by my side
as interrpator (my Russian is still very bad) far into the night, I tell
her ‘Go home’ (my mood is bad) but she stays, she is ‘my friend.’”<a id="FNanchor_A13-501" href="#Footnote_A13-501" class="fnanchor">A13-501</a></p>

<p>For 3 days Oswald was confined in the psychiatric ward of the
hospital. He was examined by a psychiatrist, who concluded that he
was not dangerous to other people and could be transferred to the
“somatic” department. Hospital records containing the results of
the examination<a id="FNanchor_A13-502" href="#Footnote_A13-502" class="fnanchor">A13-502</a> state that Oswald came to Russia in order to apply
for citizenship, and that “in order to postpone his departure he inflicted
the injury upon himself.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-503" href="#Footnote_A13-503" class="fnanchor">A13-503</a> They note that Oswald understood
some Russian and, presumably based on information which he
provided, that he had “graduated from a technical high school in radio
technology and radio electronics.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-504" href="#Footnote_A13-504" class="fnanchor">A13-504</a> The record states: “He claims
he regrets his action. After recovering he intends to return to his
homeland.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-505" href="#Footnote_A13-505" class="fnanchor">A13-505</a></p>

<p>Oswald resented being in the psychiatric ward and told Rima Shirokova
that he wanted a transfer.<a id="FNanchor_A13-506" href="#Footnote_A13-506" class="fnanchor">A13-506</a> She visited him at the hospital
frequently and his diary records that “only at this moment” did he
“notice [that] she is preety.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-507" href="#Footnote_A13-507" class="fnanchor">A13-507</a> Another entry for the hospital period
says: “Afternoon I am visited by Roza Agafonova of the hotel tourist
office, who askes about my health, very beautiful, excelant Eng., very
merry and kind, she makes me very glad to be alive.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-508" href="#Footnote_A13-508" class="fnanchor">A13-508</a> These entries
reflect an attitude gentler and friendlier than his attitude before the
suicide attempt, when he seemed to be coldly concerned only with
his status in Russia. Once Oswald was out of the psychiatric ward,
he found the hospital more pleasant. The new ward, which he shared
with 11 other patients, was “airy,” and the food was good. His only
complaint, according to his diary, was that an “elderly American”
patient was distrustful of him because he had not registered at the
American Embassy and because he was evasive about the reasons for
his presence in Moscow and confinement in the hospital.<a id="FNanchor_A13-509" href="#Footnote_A13-509" class="fnanchor">A13-509</a></p>

<p>He was released from the hospital on October 28,<a id="FNanchor_A13-510" href="#Footnote_A13-510" class="fnanchor">A13-510</a> and, accompanied
by Rima Shirokova, was driven to the Hotel Berlin in an Intourist
car. After he said goodby to Lyudmila Dmitrieva, head of the Intourist
office at the Berlin, and to Roza Agafonova, another Intourist
employee at the hotel, he checked out of the Berlin and registered at
the Metropole,<a id="FNanchor_A13-511" href="#Footnote_A13-511" class="fnanchor">A13-511</a> a large hotel under the same administration as the
Berlin.<a id="FNanchor_A13-512" href="#Footnote_A13-512" class="fnanchor">A13-512</a> The Government had undoubtedly directed him to make
the change. His visa had expired while he was in the hospital, and his
presence in Russia was technically illegal; he had received no word
that the decision that he must leave had been reversed. Later that day,
however, Rima told him that the “Pass and Registration Office” wished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_693">693</span>
to talk to him about his future.<a id="FNanchor_A13-513" href="#Footnote_A13-513" class="fnanchor">A13-513</a> According to the diary, when
Oswald appeared at the office he was asked whether he still wanted to
become a Soviet citizen and he replied that he did; he provided his
Marine Corps discharge papers for identification. He was told that he
could not expect a decision soon, and was dismissed. During this
interview, Oswald was apparently questioned about the interview
which preceded his hospitalization, which led him to conclude that
there had been no communication between the two sets of officials.<a id="FNanchor_A13-514" href="#Footnote_A13-514" class="fnanchor">A13-514</a>
That evening he met Rima, on whom he vented his frustration at being
put off by the authorities.<a id="FNanchor_A13-515" href="#Footnote_A13-515" class="fnanchor">A13-515</a></p>

<p>Oswald ate only once on the following day; he stayed near the telephone,
fully dressed and ready to leave immediately if he were summoned.
He remained in his room for 3 days, which seemed to him
“like three years,”<a id="FNanchor_A13-516" href="#Footnote_A13-516" class="fnanchor">A13-516</a> until October 31, when he decided to act. He met
Rima Shirokova at noon and told her that he was impatient, but did
not say what he planned to do; she cautioned him to stay in his room
“and eat well.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-517" href="#Footnote_A13-517" class="fnanchor">A13-517</a> She left him after a short while and, a few minutes
later, he took a taxi to the American Embassy, where he asked to see
the consul. (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 24, 912, 913, pp. 264, 263,
261.) When the receptionist asked him first to sign the tourist register,
he laid his passport on the desk and said that he had come to
“dissolve his American citizenship.” Richard E. Snyder, the Second
Secretary and senior consular official,<a id="FNanchor_A13-518" href="#Footnote_A13-518" class="fnanchor">A13-518</a> was summoned, and he invited
Oswald into his office.<a id="FNanchor_A13-519" href="#Footnote_A13-519" class="fnanchor">A13-519</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s meeting with Snyder, at which Snyder’s assistant,
John A. McVickar, was also present, is more fully discussed in appendix
XV to the Commission’s report. Oswald declared that he
wanted to renounce his American citizenship; he denounced the United
States and praised the Government of the Soviet Union. Over
Oswald’s objections, Snyder sought to learn something of Oswald’s
motives and background and to forestall immediate action. Oswald
told him that he had already offered to tell a Soviet official what he
had learned as a radar operator in the Marines. The interview ended
when Snyder told Oswald that he could renounce his citizenship on the
following Monday, 2 days later, if he would appear personally to do
so. During the interview, Oswald handed to Snyder a note<a id="FNanchor_A13-520" href="#Footnote_A13-520" class="fnanchor">A13-520</a> which
suggests that he had studied and sought to comply with section 349
of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provides for loss of
American citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_A13-521" href="#Footnote_A13-521" class="fnanchor">A13-521</a> The note contains paragraphs which read
like inartistic attempts to cast off citizenship in three of the ways
specified by the statute. The attempts failed but there is no reason
to doubt that they were sincere. Snyder has testified that he believed
that Oswald would immediately have formally renounced his citizenship
had he been permitted to do so.<a id="FNanchor_A13-522" href="#Footnote_A13-522" class="fnanchor">A13-522</a></p>

<p>The interview lasted for less than an hour. Oswald returned to
his hotel angry about the delay but “elated” by the “showdown” and
sure that he would be permitted to remain after his “sign of * * *
faith” in the Russians.<a id="FNanchor_A13-523" href="#Footnote_A13-523" class="fnanchor">A13-523</a> Soon after he returned to the hotel, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_694">694</span>
approached by A. I. Goldberg, a reporter for the Associated Press,
whom the Embassy had told about Oswald’s actions. Oswald refused
to speak to him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-524" href="#Footnote_A13-524" class="fnanchor">A13-524</a> He answered a few questions for two other reporters,
R. J. Korengold and Miss Aline Mosby, but again refused to
be interviewed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-525" href="#Footnote_A13-525" class="fnanchor">A13-525</a> Thereafter, the news services made repeated unsuccessful
attempts to interview him, which he thought was an indirect
form of pressure from the Embassy to return to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-526" href="#Footnote_A13-526" class="fnanchor">A13-526</a></p>

<p>On the day after Oswald’s meeting with Snyder, his family read
in the newspapers about his appearance at the Embassy and tried
to contact him. Mrs. Oswald testified that she was shocked at her
son’s decision to defect but respected his motives for doing so; later
she suspected that he had been forcibly removed to Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-527" href="#Footnote_A13-527" class="fnanchor">A13-527</a> She
placed a telephone call to him,<a id="FNanchor_A13-528" href="#Footnote_A13-528" class="fnanchor">A13-528</a> but he either refused to speak to
her<a id="FNanchor_A13-529" href="#Footnote_A13-529" class="fnanchor">A13-529</a> or cut her off very quickly.<a id="FNanchor_A13-530" href="#Footnote_A13-530" class="fnanchor">A13-530</a> So too, on November 2, he rejected
the Embassy’s efforts to deliver or read on the telephone a telegram
from his brother Robert.<a id="FNanchor_A13-531" href="#Footnote_A13-531" class="fnanchor">A13-531</a> A call from Robert was either canceled
before it was completed or was refused.<a id="FNanchor_A13-532" href="#Footnote_A13-532" class="fnanchor">A13-532</a> Robert’s telegram, along
with a message asking Oswald to contact him immediately, which
Robert had asked the State Department to deliver,<a id="FNanchor_A13-533" href="#Footnote_A13-533" class="fnanchor">A13-533</a> was finally sent
to Oswald from the Embassy by registered mail.<a id="FNanchor_A13-534" href="#Footnote_A13-534" class="fnanchor">A13-534</a></p>

<p>A few days later, the Embassy received a letter from Oswald dated
November 3 which requested that his citizenship be revoked.<a id="FNanchor_A13-535" href="#Footnote_A13-535" class="fnanchor">A13-535</a> The
letter stated that he had appeared at the Embassy “for the purpose
of signing the formal papers to this effect” and protested against
the “conduct of the official” who had refused him “this legal right.” Oswald
noted that his application for Soviet citizenship was pending
and said that if it were granted he would ask the Soviet Government
“to lodge a formal protest” on his behalf.<a id="FNanchor_A13-536" href="#Footnote_A13-536" class="fnanchor">A13-536</a> The Embassy replied on
November 9 that Oswald could renounce his citizenship by appearing
at the Embassy and executing the necessary papers.<a id="FNanchor_A13-537" href="#Footnote_A13-537" class="fnanchor">A13-537</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s diary describes the period from November 2 to November
15, during which he continued to isolate himself, as “days of utter
loneliness.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-538" href="#Footnote_A13-538" class="fnanchor">A13-538</a> On November 8, he wrote to his brother:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="in0">Dear Robert</p>

<p>Well, what shall we talk about, the weather perhaps? Certainly
you do not wish me to speak of my decision to remain in
the Soviet Union and apply for citizenship here, since I’m afraid
you would not be able to comprehend my my reasons. You really
dont know anything about me. Do you know for instance that I
have waited to do this for well over a year, do you know that
I * * * [phrase in Russian] speak a fair amount of Russian
which I have been studing for many months.</p>

<p>I have been told that I will not <em>have</em> to leave the Soviet Union
if I do not care to. this than is my decision. I will not leave
this country, the Soviet Union, under any conditions, I will never
return to the United States which is a country I hate.</p>

<p>Someday, perhaps soon, and than again perhaps in a few years,
I will become a citizen of the Soviet Union, but it is a very legal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_695">695</span>
process, <em>in any event</em>, I will not have to leave the Soviet Union
and I will never * * * [word missing].</p>

<p>I recived your telegram and was glad to hear from you, only
one word bothered me, the word “mistake.” I assume you mean
that I have made a “mistake” it is not for you to tell me that you
cannot understand my reasons for this very action.</p>

<p>I will not speak to anyone from the United States over the telephone
since it may be taped by the Americans.</p>

<p>If you wish to corespond with me you can write to the below
address, but I really don’t see what we could take about if you
want to send me money, that I can use, but I do not expect to be
able to send it back.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Oswald’s statement that he had been told that he could remain in
Russia was not true. According to his diary, he was not told
until later that he could remain even temporarily in Russia,<a id="FNanchor_A13-540" href="#Footnote_A13-540" class="fnanchor">A13-540</a> and
only in January was he told that he could remain indefinitely.<a id="FNanchor_A13-541" href="#Footnote_A13-541" class="fnanchor">A13-541</a> The
Embassy tried to deliver a typed copy of a telegram from his brother
John on November 9; Oswald refused to answer the knock on his
door, and the message was then sent to him by registered mail.<a id="FNanchor_A13-542" href="#Footnote_A13-542" class="fnanchor">A13-542</a></p>

<p>Toward the end of this waiting period, probably on November 13,
Aline Mosby succeeded in interviewing Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A13-543" href="#Footnote_A13-543" class="fnanchor">A13-543</a> A reporter for
United Press International, she had called him on the telephone and
was told to come right over, Oswald’s explanation being that he thought
she might “understand and be friendly” because she was a woman.<a id="FNanchor_A13-544" href="#Footnote_A13-544" class="fnanchor">A13-544</a>
She was the first person who was not a Soviet citizen to whom he
granted an interview since his meeting with Snyder at the Embassy
on October 31. Miss Mosby found him polite but stiff; she said that he
seemed full of confidence, often showing a “small smile, more like a
smirk,” and that he talked almost “non-stop.” Oswald said to her
that he had been told that he could remain in the Soviet Union
and that job possibilities were being explored; they thought it
probably would be best, he said, to continue his education. He
admitted that his Russian was bad but was confident that it would
improve rapidly. He based his dislike for the United States on his
observations of racial prejudice and the contrast between “the luxuries
of Park Avenue and workers’ lives on the East Side,” and mentioned
his mother’s poverty; he said that if he had remained in the United
States he too would have become either a capitalist or a worker. “One
way or another,” he said, “I’d lose in the United States. In my own
mind, even if I’d be exploiting other workers. That’s why I chose
Marxist ideology.”</p>

<p>Oswald told his interviewer that he had been interested in Communist
theory since he was 15, when “an old lady” in New York
handed him “a pamphlet about saving the Rosenbergs.” But when
Mosby asked if he were a member of the Communist Party he said
that he had never met a Communist and that he “might have seen”
one only once, when he saw that “old lady.” He told her that while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_696">696</span>
he was in the Marine Corps he had seen American imperialism in
action, and had saved $1,500 in secret preparation for his defection
to Russia. His only apparent regrets concerned his family: his
mother, whom he had not told of his plans, and his brother, who might
lose his job as a result of the publicity.<a id="FNanchor_A13-545" href="#Footnote_A13-545" class="fnanchor">A13-545</a></p>

<p>The interview lasted for about 2 hours. According to Oswald’s
own account, he exacted a promise from Miss Mosby that she would
show him the story before publication but she broke the promise; he
found the published story to contain distortions of his words.<a id="FNanchor_A13-546" href="#Footnote_A13-546" class="fnanchor">A13-546</a>
Miss Mosby’s notes indicate that he called her to complain of the distortions,
saying in particular that his family had not been “poverty-stricken”
and that his defection was not prompted by personal hardship
but that was “a matter only of ideology.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-547" href="#Footnote_A13-547" class="fnanchor">A13-547</a></p>

<p>According to the diary, Oswald was told in mid-November that he
could remain temporarily in Russia “until some solution was found
with what to do” with him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-548" href="#Footnote_A13-548" class="fnanchor">A13-548</a> Armed with this “comforting
news,”<a id="FNanchor_A13-549" href="#Footnote_A13-549" class="fnanchor">A13-549</a> he granted a second interview, again to a woman, on
November 16.<a id="FNanchor_A13-550" href="#Footnote_A13-550" class="fnanchor">A13-550</a> Miss Priscilla Johnson of the North American
Newspaper Alliance knocked on the door of his room at the
Metropole, and Oswald agreed to come to her room at the hotel
that evening. This interview lasted about 5 hours, from 9 p.m.
until about 2 in the morning. During the interview he frequently
mentioned the fact that he would be able to remain in Russia,
which gave him great pleasure, but he also showed disappointment
about the difficulties standing in the way of his request for Soviet
citizenship. He repeated most of the information he had given Aline
Mosby and again denied having been a member of the Communist
Party or even ever having seen a Communist in the United States.
When Miss Johnson asked him to specify some of the socialist writers
whose works he had read during the past 5 years, he could name
only Marx and Engels; the only title he could recall was “Das Kapital.”
They talked for a long while about Communist economic theory,
which Miss Johnson thought was “his language”; she became convinced
that his knowledge of the subject was very superficial.<a id="FNanchor_A13-551" href="#Footnote_A13-551" class="fnanchor">A13-551</a> He commented
that the Russians treated his defection as a “legal formality,”
neither encouraging nor discouraging it.<a id="FNanchor_A13-552" href="#Footnote_A13-552" class="fnanchor">A13-552</a> When she suggested
that if he really wished to renounce his American citizenship he could
do so by returning to the Embassy, he said that he would “never set
foot in the Embassy again,” since he was sure that he would be given the
“same run-around” as before. He seemed to Miss Johnson to be
avoiding effective renunciation, consciously or unconsciously, in order
to preserve his right to reenter the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-553" href="#Footnote_A13-553" class="fnanchor">A13-553</a></p>

<p>For the rest of the year, Oswald seldom left his hotel room where
he had arranged to take his meals, except perhaps for a few trips
to museums. He spent most of his time studying Russian, “8
hours a day” his diary records. The routine was broken only
by another interview at the passport office; occasional visits from
Rima Shirokova; lessons in Russian from her and other Intourist
guides; and a New Year’s visit from Roza Agafonova, who gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_697">697</span>
him a small “Boratin” clown as a New Year’s present.<a id="FNanchor_A13-554" href="#Footnote_A13-554" class="fnanchor">A13-554</a> He
replied to a letter from Robert in a letter quoted at length in chapter
VII of this report, which contains his most bitter statements against
the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-555" href="#Footnote_A13-555" class="fnanchor">A13-555</a> Robert received a third letter on December 17,
in which Oswald said that he would not write again and did not wish
Robert to write to him. The letter concluded:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am starting a new life and I do not wish to have anything to
do with the old life.</p>

<p>I hope you and your family will always be in good health.</p>

<p class="sigright">
Lee<a id="FNanchor_A13-556" href="#Footnote_A13-556" class="fnanchor">A13-556</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">His mother mailed him a personal check for $20 dated December 18.
It was returned to her on January 5 with the notation that he could
not “use this check, of course”; he asked her to send him $20 in cash
and added that he had little money and needed “the rest,” presumably
a reference to the $100 he had given her in September. Mrs. Oswald
later sent him a money order for about $25.<a id="FNanchor_A13-557" href="#Footnote_A13-557" class="fnanchor">A13-557</a></p>

<p>On January 4, Oswald was summoned to the Soviet Passport Office
and given Identity Document for Stateless Persons No. 311479.<a id="FNanchor_A13-558" href="#Footnote_A13-558" class="fnanchor">A13-558</a> He
was told that he was being sent to Minsk,<a id="FNanchor_A13-559" href="#Footnote_A13-559" class="fnanchor">A13-559</a> an industrial city located
about 450 miles southwest of Moscow and with a population in 1959
of about 510,000.<a id="FNanchor_A13-560" href="#Footnote_A13-560" class="fnanchor">A13-560</a> His disappointment that he had not been granted
Soviet citizenship was balanced by relief that the uncertainty was
ended; he told Rima Shirokova that he was happy.<a id="FNanchor_A13-561" href="#Footnote_A13-561" class="fnanchor">A13-561</a> On the following
day, he went to a Government agency which the Russians
call the “Red Cross”; it gave him 5,000 rubles (about 500 new rubles,
or $500 at the official exchange rate).<a id="FNanchor_A13-562" href="#Footnote_A13-562" class="fnanchor">A13-562</a> He used 2,200 rubles
to pay his hotel bill and 150 rubles to purchase a railroad ticket to
Minsk.<a id="FNanchor_A13-563" href="#Footnote_A13-563" class="fnanchor">A13-563</a></p>

<p>Oswald arrived in Minsk on January 7. He was met at the station
by two “Red Cross” workers who took him to the Hotel Minsk. Two
Intourist employees, both of whom spoke excellent English, were
waiting for him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-564" href="#Footnote_A13-564" class="fnanchor">A13-564</a> One of them, a young woman named Roza Kuznetsova,
became his close friend and attended his 21st birthday party
in October 1960.<a id="FNanchor_A13-565" href="#Footnote_A13-565" class="fnanchor">A13-565</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 2609, <a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a>.) On
the following day, Oswald met the “Mayor,” who welcomed him to
Minsk, promised him a rent-free apartment, and warned him against
“uncultured persons” who sometimes insulted foreigners.<a id="FNanchor_A13-566" href="#Footnote_A13-566" class="fnanchor">A13-566</a></p>

<p>Oswald reported for work at the Belorussian Radio and Television
Factory on January 13.<a id="FNanchor_A13-567" href="#Footnote_A13-567" class="fnanchor">A13-567</a> Two days earlier he had visited the factory
and met Alexander Ziger, a Polish Jew who had emigrated to Argentina
in 1938 and went to Russia in 1955. Ziger was a department
head at the factory; he spoke English, and he and his family became
good friends of Oswald and corresponded with him after his return
to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-568" href="#Footnote_A13-568" class="fnanchor">A13-568</a> The factory, a major producer of electronic
parts and systems, employed about 5,000 persons.<a id="FNanchor_A13-569" href="#Footnote_A13-569" class="fnanchor">A13-569</a> Oswald’s union
card described him as a “metal worker”;<a id="FNanchor_A13-570" href="#Footnote_A13-570" class="fnanchor">A13-570</a> Marina testified that he
fashioned parts on a lathe.<a id="FNanchor_A13-571" href="#Footnote_A13-571" class="fnanchor">A13-571</a> As Oswald later described it, the shop in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_698">698</span>
which he worked, called the “experimental shop,”<a id="FNanchor_A13-572" href="#Footnote_A13-572" class="fnanchor">A13-572</a> employed 58
workers and 5 foremen. It was located in the middle part of the factory
area in a 2-story building made of red brick. The workday began
at 8 o’clock sharp. Work was assigned according to “pay levels,”
which were numbered from one to five plus a top “master” level. A
worker could ask to be tested for a higher level at any time.<a id="FNanchor_A13-573" href="#Footnote_A13-573" class="fnanchor">A13-573</a></p>

<p>Oswald had hoped to continue his education in Russia, and was
disappointed by his assignment to a factory.<a id="FNanchor_A13-574" href="#Footnote_A13-574" class="fnanchor">A13-574</a> His salary varied
from 700 to perhaps as high as 900 rubles per month ($70-$90).<a id="FNanchor_A13-575" href="#Footnote_A13-575" class="fnanchor">A13-575</a>
Although high compared with the salaries of certain professional
groups in Russia, which in some areas have not grown proportionately
with the wages of factory workers,<a id="FNanchor_A13-576" href="#Footnote_A13-576" class="fnanchor">A13-576</a> his salary was normal
for his type of work.<a id="FNanchor_A13-577" href="#Footnote_A13-577" class="fnanchor">A13-577</a> It was supplemented, however, by 700 rubles
per month, which he received from the “Red Cross,” and, according to
Oswald, his total income was about equal to that of the director of the
factory.<a id="FNanchor_A13-578" href="#Footnote_A13-578" class="fnanchor">A13-578</a> In August he applied for membership in the union;<a id="FNanchor_A13-579" href="#Footnote_A13-579" class="fnanchor">A13-579</a>
he became a dues-paying member in September.<a id="FNanchor_A13-580" href="#Footnote_A13-580" class="fnanchor">A13-580</a></p>

<p>Undoubtedly more noteworthy to most Russians than his extra income
was the attractive apartment which Oswald was given in March
1959. It was a small flat with a balcony overlooking the river,<a id="FNanchor_A13-581" href="#Footnote_A13-581" class="fnanchor">A13-581</a> for
which he paid only 60 rubles a month.<a id="FNanchor_A13-582" href="#Footnote_A13-582" class="fnanchor">A13-582</a> (See Commission Exhibit
No. 2606, <a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a>.) Oswald describes it in his diary as “a Russian
dream.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-583" href="#Footnote_A13-583" class="fnanchor">A13-583</a> Had Oswald been a Russian worker, he would probably
have had to wait for several years for a comparable apartment,
and would have been given one even then only if he had a family.<a id="FNanchor_A13-584" href="#Footnote_A13-584" class="fnanchor">A13-584</a> The
“Red Cross” subsidy and the apartment were typical of the favorable
treatment which the Soviet Union has given defectors.<a id="FNanchor_A13-585" href="#Footnote_A13-585" class="fnanchor">A13-585</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s diary records that he enjoyed his first months in Minsk.
His work at the factory was easy and his coworkers were friendly
and curious about life in the United States; he declined an invitation
to speak at a mass meeting. He took Roza Kuznetsova, his interpreter
and language teacher,<a id="FNanchor_A13-586" href="#Footnote_A13-586" class="fnanchor">A13-586</a> to the theater, a movie, or an opera almost
every night, until he moved into his apartment and temporarily lost
contact with her. He wrote in his diary, “I’m living big and am very
satisfied.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-587" href="#Footnote_A13-587" class="fnanchor">A13-587</a> In March or April, he met Pavel Golovachev, a co-worker
at the factory, whom Oswald described as intelligent and
friendly and an excellent radio technician. (See Commission Exhibit
No. 2609, <a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a>.) Oswald helped Golovachev with English.<a id="FNanchor_A13-588" href="#Footnote_A13-588" class="fnanchor">A13-588</a> They
became friends,<a id="FNanchor_A13-589" href="#Footnote_A13-589" class="fnanchor">A13-589</a> and corresponded after Oswald returned to the
United States until at least as late as September 1963.<a id="FNanchor_A13-590" href="#Footnote_A13-590" class="fnanchor">A13-590</a></p>

<p>The spring and summer passed easily and uneventfully. There were
picnics and drives in the country, which Oswald described as “green
beauty.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-591" href="#Footnote_A13-591" class="fnanchor">A13-591</a> On June 18, he obtained a hunting license and soon
afterward purchased a 16-gage single-barrel shotgun. His hunting
license identifies him as “Aleksy Harvey Oswald.” (He was called
“Alec” by his Russian friends, because “Lee” sounded foreign to
them and was difficult for them to pronounce.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-592" href="#Footnote_A13-592" class="fnanchor">A13-592</a> He joined a local
chapter of the Belorussian Society of Hunters and Fishermen, a hunting
club sponsored by his factory, and hunted for small game in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_699">699</span>
farm regions around Minsk about half a dozen times in the summer
and fall. The hunters spent the night in small villages and often left
their bag with the villagers; Oswald described the peasant life which
he saw as crude and poor.<a id="FNanchor_A13-593" href="#Footnote_A13-593" class="fnanchor">A13-593</a> Sometime in June, he met Ella
German, a worker at the factory, of whom he later said he “perhaps
fell in love with her the first minute” he saw her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-594" href="#Footnote_A13-594" class="fnanchor">A13-594</a> (See Commission
Exhibit No. 2609, <a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a>.)</p>

<p>At the same time, however, the first signs of disillusionment with his
Russian life appeared. He noted in his diary that he felt “uneasy
inside” after a friend took him aside at a party and advised him to
return to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-595" href="#Footnote_A13-595" class="fnanchor">A13-595</a> Another entry compared life in Minsk
with military life:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have become habituatated to a small cafe which is where I dine in
the evening. The food is generaly poor and always eactly the
same, menue in any cafe, at any point in the city. The food is
cheap and I don’t really care about quiality after three years in the
U.S.M.C.<a id="FNanchor_A13-596" href="#Footnote_A13-596" class="fnanchor">A13-596</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In an entry for August-September, he wrote that he was becoming
“increasingly concious of just what sort of a sociaty” he lived in.<a id="FNanchor_A13-597" href="#Footnote_A13-597" class="fnanchor">A13-597</a></p>

<p>He spent New Year’s Day at the home of Ella German and her
family. They ate and drank in a friendly atmosphere, and he was
“drunk and happy” when he returned home. During the walk back
to his apartment he decided to ask Ella to marry him. On the following
night, after he had brought her home from the movies, he proposed
on her doorstep. She rejected him, saying that she did not
love him and that she was afraid to marry an American. She said
that the Polish intervention in the 1920’s had led to the arrest of all
people in the Soviet Union of Polish origin and she feared that
something similar might happen to Americans some day. Oswald
was “too stunned to think,” and concluded that she had gone out with
him only because she was envied by the other girls for having an
American as an escort.<a id="FNanchor_A13-598" href="#Footnote_A13-598" class="fnanchor">A13-598</a> But in one of the entries in the diary he
appears to have attributed her failure to love him to “a state of fear
which was always in the Soviet Union.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-599" href="#Footnote_A13-599" class="fnanchor">A13-599</a> His affection for Ella
German apparently continued for some time;<a id="FNanchor_A13-600" href="#Footnote_A13-600" class="fnanchor">A13-600</a> he had his last formal
date with her in February and remained on friendly terms with her
as long as he was in Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-601" href="#Footnote_A13-601" class="fnanchor">A13-601</a></p>

<p>After he returned to the United States, Oswald often commented on
Russian life. He discussed the Soviet systems of public education<a id="FNanchor_A13-602" href="#Footnote_A13-602" class="fnanchor">A13-602</a>
and medical care.<a id="FNanchor_A13-603" href="#Footnote_A13-603" class="fnanchor">A13-603</a> He observed to one acquaintance that everyone
in Russia was trained to do something,<a id="FNanchor_A13-604" href="#Footnote_A13-604" class="fnanchor">A13-604</a> and discussed with another
the system of regular wage and salary increases.<a id="FNanchor_A13-605" href="#Footnote_A13-605" class="fnanchor">A13-605</a> His most frequent
criticisms concerned the contrast between the lives of ordinary workers
and the lives of Communist Party members. He told an acquaintance
in Dallas that the working class in the Soviet Union made
just about enough to buy clothing and food and that only party
members could afford luxuries.<a id="FNanchor_A13-606" href="#Footnote_A13-606" class="fnanchor">A13-606</a> On another occasion, he remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_700">700</span>
that if he had had as much money as some of the “managers,” he could
have visited the Black Sea resorts.<a id="FNanchor_A13-607" href="#Footnote_A13-607" class="fnanchor">A13-607</a> He complained about the lack
of freedom in Russia;<a id="FNanchor_A13-608" href="#Footnote_A13-608" class="fnanchor">A13-608</a> the lack of opportunity to travel;<a id="FNanchor_A13-609" href="#Footnote_A13-609" class="fnanchor">A13-609</a> inadequate
housing;<a id="FNanchor_A13-610" href="#Footnote_A13-610" class="fnanchor">A13-610</a> and the chronic scarcity of food products.<a id="FNanchor_A13-611" href="#Footnote_A13-611" class="fnanchor">A13-611</a> To one
acquaintance, he observed that the party members were all “opportunists,”
who “shouted the loudest and made the most noise,” but who
were interested only in their own welfare.<a id="FNanchor_A13-612" href="#Footnote_A13-612" class="fnanchor">A13-612</a></p>

<p>He expressed similar views in a manuscript which he worked on in
Russia<a id="FNanchor_A13-613" href="#Footnote_A13-613" class="fnanchor">A13-613</a> and probably intended to publish; soon after he returned
to the United States, he hired a stenographer to prepare a typed draft
from his notes.<a id="FNanchor_A13-614" href="#Footnote_A13-614" class="fnanchor">A13-614</a> Oswald described the manuscript, which amounted
to 50 typed pages, as “a look into the lives of work-a-day average
Russians.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-615" href="#Footnote_A13-615" class="fnanchor">A13-615</a></p>

<p>The manuscript describes the factory in which Oswald worked and
suggests that political considerations of which Oswald disapproved
dominated its operation. He attributed the lack of unemployment to
the shortage of labor-saving machinery and the heavy load of
bureaucracy, which kept “tons of paper work” flowing in and out of
the factory and required a high foreman-worker ratio.<a id="FNanchor_A13-616" href="#Footnote_A13-616" class="fnanchor">A13-616</a> In addition,
he wrote, there was “a small army of examiners, committees, and
supply checkers and the quality-control board.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-617" href="#Footnote_A13-617" class="fnanchor">A13-617</a></p>

<p>He described life in Russia, including life at the factory, as
centered around the “Kollective.” The head of the Kollective in his
shop, Comrade Lebizen, saw to it that everyone maintained shop discipline,
attended party meetings, and received all the new propaganda
as it came out. He hung the walls of the shop with signs and slogans
of the Communist Party. Meetings of the Kollective were “so numerous
as to be staggering.” In a single month, there were scheduled
one meeting of the professional union, four political information
meetings, two young Communist meetings, one meeting of the production
committee to discuss ways of improving work, two Communist
Party meetings, four meetings of the “School of Communist
Labor,” and one sports meeting. All but one of them were compulsory
for Communist Party members and all but three were compulsory
for everyone.<a id="FNanchor_A13-618" href="#Footnote_A13-618" class="fnanchor">A13-618</a> (Marina Oswald testified that her husband did not
attend the courses in Marxism and Leninism given in the factory for
party members and those who wished to become party members.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-619" href="#Footnote_A13-619" class="fnanchor">A13-619</a>
They were scheduled so as not to interfere with work, and lasted
anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours. Oswald said that no one liked
the meetings, which were accepted “philosophically”; at the political
meetings especially, everyone paid strict attention, and party members
were posted in the audience to watch for the slightest sign that anyone’s
attention might relax, even for a moment.<a id="FNanchor_A13-620" href="#Footnote_A13-620" class="fnanchor">A13-620</a></p>

<p>Oswald wrote that the “spontaneous” demonstrations on Soviet
holidays or for distinguished visitors were almost as well organized as
the Kollectivist meetings at the factory.<a id="FNanchor_A13-621" href="#Footnote_A13-621" class="fnanchor">A13-621</a> He noted that elections
were supervised to ensure that everyone voted, and that they voted for
the candidates of the Communist Party. The manuscript touches on
other aspects of Soviet life—as the housing shortage and the corruption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_701">701</span>
which it evoked, the “rest-homes” where workers had their vacations,
television and the omni-present radio, and Russian reading
habits.<a id="FNanchor_A13-622" href="#Footnote_A13-622" class="fnanchor">A13-622</a> This writing also may include only what Oswald thought
might be acceptable.</p>

<p>On January 4, 1961, I year after he had been issued his “stateless”
residence permit, Oswald was summoned to the passport office in
Minsk and asked if he still wanted to become a Soviet citizen. He
replied that he did not, but asked that his residence permit be extended
for another year.<a id="FNanchor_A13-623" href="#Footnote_A13-623" class="fnanchor">A13-623</a> The entry in his diary for January 4-31 reads:
“I am stating to reconsider my disire about staying. The work is drab.
The money I get has nowhere to be spent. No nightclubs or bowling
allys, no places of recreation acept the trade union dances. I have had
enough.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-624" href="#Footnote_A13-624" class="fnanchor">A13-624</a></p>

<p>The American Embassy in Moscow had not heard from Oswald
after it received his letter of November 3, 1959.<a id="FNanchor_A13-625" href="#Footnote_A13-625" class="fnanchor">A13-625</a> On February 13,
1961, it received an undated letter from him which had been mailed
in Minsk about a week earlier. He asked for the return of his passport
and stated that he wanted to return to the United States if he could
“come to some agreement [with the American Government] concerning
the dropping of any legal proceedings” against him. He noted
that he had not become a Soviet citizen and was living in Russia with
“nonpermanent type papers for a foreigner,” and said that he did not
appear personally because he could not leave Minsk without permission.
The letter concluded: “I hope that in recalling the responsibility
I have to America that you remember yours in doing everything
you can to help me, since I am an American citizen.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-626" href="#Footnote_A13-626" class="fnanchor">A13-626</a> In this letter,
Oswald referred to a previous letter which he said had gone unanswered;
there is evidence that such a letter was never sent.<a id="FNanchor_A13-627" href="#Footnote_A13-627" class="fnanchor">A13-627</a></p>

<p>The Second Secretary, Richard Snyder, answered on February 28
that Oswald would have to appear at the Embassy personally to discuss
his return to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-628" href="#Footnote_A13-628" class="fnanchor">A13-628</a> In the meantime, Oswald’s
mother, who in January had inquired at the Department of State
about his whereabouts,<a id="FNanchor_A13-629" href="#Footnote_A13-629" class="fnanchor">A13-629</a> had been notified of his letter.<a id="FNanchor_A13-630" href="#Footnote_A13-630" class="fnanchor">A13-630</a> A second
letter from Oswald, posted on March 5, reached the Embassy on March
20; it reiterated that he was unable to leave Minsk without permission
and asked that “preliminary inquiries * * * be put in the form of a
questionnaire” and sent to him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-631" href="#Footnote_A13-631" class="fnanchor">A13-631</a> His diary entry for this period
records his “state of expectation about going back to the U.S.,” and
adds that a friend had approved his plans but warned him not to
discuss them with others.<a id="FNanchor_A13-632" href="#Footnote_A13-632" class="fnanchor">A13-632</a> (The Soviet authorities had undoubtedly
intercepted and read the correspondence between Oswald and the
Embassy and knew of his plans.<a id="FNanchor_A13-633" href="#Footnote_A13-633" class="fnanchor">A13-633</a> Soon after the correspondence
began, his monthly payments from the “Red Cross” were cut off.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-634" href="#Footnote_A13-634" class="fnanchor">A13-634</a>
Having informed Washington,<a id="FNanchor_A13-635" href="#Footnote_A13-635" class="fnanchor">A13-635</a> the Embassy wrote to Oswald on
March 24, stating again that he would have to come to Moscow.<a id="FNanchor_A13-636" href="#Footnote_A13-636" class="fnanchor">A13-636</a>
Later, the Department of State decided that Oswald’s passport should
be returned to him only if he appeared at the Embassy for it and the
Embassy was satisfied, after exploring the matter with him, that he
had not renounced his citizenship.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_702">702</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-637" href="#Footnote_A13-637" class="fnanchor">A13-637</a></p>

<p>Sometime in the second week of March, Miss Katherine Mallory,
who was on tour in Minsk with the University of Michigan symphonic
band, found herself surrounded by curious Russian citizens. A young
man who identified himself as a Texan and former marine stepped
out of the crowd and asked if she needed an interpreter; he interpreted
for her for the next 15 or 20 minutes. Later he told her that he
despised the United States and hoped to stay in Minsk for the rest of
his life. Miss Mallory is unable to swear that her interpreter was
Oswald, but is personally convinced that it was he.<a id="FNanchor_A13-638" href="#Footnote_A13-638" class="fnanchor">A13-638</a></p>

<p>A few days later, probably on March 17, Oswald attended a trade
union dance with a friend, Erik Titovyets, at the Palace of Culture
for Professional Workers in Minsk.<a id="FNanchor_A13-639" href="#Footnote_A13-639" class="fnanchor">A13-639</a> The dance followed a lecture
by a Russian woman who had recently returned from a trip to the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-640" href="#Footnote_A13-640" class="fnanchor">A13-640</a> Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova arrived too late to
hear the lecture<a id="FNanchor_A13-641" href="#Footnote_A13-641" class="fnanchor">A13-641</a> but was at the dance. Oswald noticed her and asked
Yuriy Merezhinskiy, the son of the lecturer and a friend of both
Oswald and Marina, to introduce him to her. Oswald asked her to
dance. According to the diary, they liked each other immediately and
he obtained her telephone number before she left.<a id="FNanchor_A13-642" href="#Footnote_A13-642" class="fnanchor">A13-642</a> Marina testified
that she told Oswald that she might see him at another dance, but did
not give him her telephone number.<a id="FNanchor_A13-643" href="#Footnote_A13-643" class="fnanchor">A13-643</a> Oswald was smitten.<a id="FNanchor_A13-644" href="#Footnote_A13-644" class="fnanchor">A13-644</a></p>

<p>Marina Prusakova was 19 years old when she met Oswald. (See
Commission Exhibit No. 1395, <a href="#Page_270">p. 270</a>.) She was born on July 17, 1941,
at Severodvinsk (formerly Molotovsk), Arkhangel Oblast’, Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-645" href="#Footnote_A13-645" class="fnanchor">A13-645</a>
A few years later, her mother, Klavdiya Vasilievna Prusakova, married
Aleksandr Ivanovich Medvedev, who became the only father Marina
knew.<a id="FNanchor_A13-646" href="#Footnote_A13-646" class="fnanchor">A13-646</a> While she was still a young girl, Marina went to Arkhangel’sk,
Arkhangel Oblast’, to live with her maternal grandparents,
Tatyana Yakovlevna Prusakova and Vasiliy Prusakov. Her grandfather
died when Marina was about 4 years old; she continued to live
with her grandmother for some time.<a id="FNanchor_A13-647" href="#Footnote_A13-647" class="fnanchor">A13-647</a> When she was not more than
7, she moved to Zguritva, Moldavian SSR (formerly called Bessarabia)
to live with her mother and stepfather, who was an electrical
worker.<a id="FNanchor_A13-648" href="#Footnote_A13-648" class="fnanchor">A13-648</a> In 1952, the family moved to Leningrad,<a id="FNanchor_A13-649" href="#Footnote_A13-649" class="fnanchor">A13-649</a> where her
stepfather obtained a job in a power station.<a id="FNanchor_A13-650" href="#Footnote_A13-650" class="fnanchor">A13-650</a> Marina testified that
neither he nor her mother was a member of the Communist Party.<a id="FNanchor_A13-651" href="#Footnote_A13-651" class="fnanchor">A13-651</a></p>

<p>In Leningrad, Marina attended the Three Hundred and Seventy-Fourth
Women’s School. After she had completed the seventh
grade at the school in 1955,<a id="FNanchor_A13-652" href="#Footnote_A13-652" class="fnanchor">A13-652</a> she entered the Pharmacy Teknikum for
special training, which she had requested on the ground that her
mother was ill and Marina might need to have a specialty in order
to support herself. While she was at the Teknikum, she joined the
Trade Union for Medical Workers<a id="FNanchor_A13-653" href="#Footnote_A13-653" class="fnanchor">A13-653</a> and, in her last year there,
worked part time in the Central Pharmacy in Leningrad. She graduated
from the Teknikum with a diploma in pharmacy in June 1959.</p>

<p>Marina’s mother had died in 1957, during Marina’s second year at
the Teknikum; she continued to live with her stepfather, but had
little contact with him. She testified that she did not get along with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_703">703</span>
her stepfather, whom she displeased by her fresh conduct; she said
that she was not easily disciplined<a id="FNanchor_A13-654" href="#Footnote_A13-654" class="fnanchor">A13-654</a> and was a source of concern to
him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-655" href="#Footnote_A13-655" class="fnanchor">A13-655</a> Because of the friction between them, Marina regarded her
childhood as an unhappy one.</p>

<p>After her graduation, Marina was assigned to a job preparing and
packing orders in a pharmaceutical warehouse in Leningrad; as a
new employee she had the right to leave this job within 3 days after
the assignment,<a id="FNanchor_A13-656" href="#Footnote_A13-656" class="fnanchor">A13-656</a> and she did so after the first day. She took no job
for the next 2 months, at the end of which she went to live in Minsk
with an aunt and uncle, the Prusakovs, who had no children. She
had known them since she was a child and there was a mutual affection
between her and them.<a id="FNanchor_A13-657" href="#Footnote_A13-657" class="fnanchor">A13-657</a> Her uncle, a member of the Communist
Party,<a id="FNanchor_A13-658" href="#Footnote_A13-658" class="fnanchor">A13-658</a> was assigned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and headed
the local bureau concerned with lumber. The Prusakovs had one of
the best apartments in a building reserved for MVD employees.<a id="FNanchor_A13-659" href="#Footnote_A13-659" class="fnanchor">A13-659</a></p>

<p>Marina was 18 when she arrived in Minsk. She had had boyfriends
in Leningrad but was not interested in marriage. In October 1960 she
started work in the drug section of the Third Clinical Hospital where
she earned about 450 rubles per month;<a id="FNanchor_A13-660" href="#Footnote_A13-660" class="fnanchor">A13-660</a> at about the same time she
became a member of the local Komsomol, the Communist youth organization.<a id="FNanchor_A13-661" href="#Footnote_A13-661" class="fnanchor">A13-661</a>
Her friends were mostly students, whose social life consisted
of meeting in cafes to sip coffee, read newspapers, gossip, and
carry on discussions. The group of friends “ran together,” and
Marina did not attach herself to a particular boyfriend. She enjoyed
this life, which she had been leading for about 7 months when she
met Oswald at the dance at the Palace of Culture in March 1961.<a id="FNanchor_A13-662" href="#Footnote_A13-662" class="fnanchor">A13-662</a></p>

<p>When Marina met Oswald, she thought he was from one of the
Russian-speaking Baltic countries because he spoke with an accent;
later that same evening she learned that he was an American.<a id="FNanchor_A13-663" href="#Footnote_A13-663" class="fnanchor">A13-663</a> She
met him again at another dance a week later.<a id="FNanchor_A13-664" href="#Footnote_A13-664" class="fnanchor">A13-664</a> They danced together
most of the evening, at the end of which he walked home with her.
They arranged to meet again the following week.<a id="FNanchor_A13-665" href="#Footnote_A13-665" class="fnanchor">A13-665</a> Before the scheduled
time, Oswald called to say that he was in the hospital and that
Marina should visit him there.<a id="FNanchor_A13-666" href="#Footnote_A13-666" class="fnanchor">A13-666</a> Medical records furnished to the
Commission by the Russian Government show that Oswald was admitted
to the Clinical Hospital—Ear, Nose, and Throat Division, on
Thursday, March 30, 1961.<a id="FNanchor_A13-667" href="#Footnote_A13-667" class="fnanchor">A13-667</a> Marina visited him often,<a id="FNanchor_A13-668" href="#Footnote_A13-668" class="fnanchor">A13-668</a> taking
advantage of her uniform to visit him outside regular visiting hours,
which were only on Sunday.<a id="FNanchor_A13-669" href="#Footnote_A13-669" class="fnanchor">A13-669</a> On Easter Sunday, the first Sunday
after his admission to the hospital, she brought him an Easter egg.<a id="FNanchor_A13-670" href="#Footnote_A13-670" class="fnanchor">A13-670</a>
On a subsequent visit, he asked her to be his fiancee, and she agreed to
consider it.<a id="FNanchor_A13-671" href="#Footnote_A13-671" class="fnanchor">A13-671</a> He left the hospital on April 11.<a id="FNanchor_A13-672" href="#Footnote_A13-672" class="fnanchor">A13-672</a></p>

<p>During these visits, Marina apparently discussed with Oswald his
reasons for coming to Russia and his current status. According to
her later account, he told her that he had surrendered his American
documents to the Embassy in Moscow and had told American officials
that he did not intend to return to the United States. He did not say
definitely that he was no longer an American citizen, but said in answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_704">704</span>
to a question about his citizenship that he could not return to the United
States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-673" href="#Footnote_A13-673" class="fnanchor">A13-673</a></p>

<p>Oswald visited Marina regularly at her aunt and uncle’s apartment;
they were apparently not disturbed by the fact that he was an American
and did not disapprove of her seeing him. He continued to ask her to
marry him and, according to her recollection, she accepted his proposal
on April 20;<a id="FNanchor_A13-674" href="#Footnote_A13-674" class="fnanchor">A13-674</a> Oswald’s diary puts the date 5 days earlier.<a id="FNanchor_A13-675" href="#Footnote_A13-675" class="fnanchor">A13-675</a>
Marina testified that she believed that Oswald could not return to the
United States when she agreed to marry him, and that she had not
married him in hope of going to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-676" href="#Footnote_A13-676" class="fnanchor">A13-676</a></p>

<p>After filing notice of their intent to marry at the registrar, obtaining
the special consent necessary for an alien to marry a citizen, and waiting
the usual 10 days, they were married on April 30.<a id="FNanchor_A13-677" href="#Footnote_A13-677" class="fnanchor">A13-677</a> The diary
entry for the wedding day reads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>two of Marinas girl friends act as bridesmaids. We are married.
At her aunts home we have a dinner reception for about
20 friends and neboribos who wish us happiness (in spite of my
origin and accept [accent?] which was in general rather disquiting
to any Russian since for. are very rare in the soviet
Union even tourist. After an evening of eating and drinking
in which * * * [Marina’s uncle] started a fright [fight?] and
the fuse blow on an overloaded circite we take our leave and
walk the 15 minutes to our home. We lived near each other, at
midnight we were home.<a id="FNanchor_A13-678" href="#Footnote_A13-678" class="fnanchor">A13-678</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">They both took 3 days off from their jobs, which they spent in Minsk.<a id="FNanchor_A13-679" href="#Footnote_A13-679" class="fnanchor">A13-679</a></p>

<p>Oswald wrote in his diary for May 1, 1 day after the wedding:
“In spite of fact I married Marina to hurt Ella I found myself in
love with Marina.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-680" href="#Footnote_A13-680" class="fnanchor">A13-680</a> The next entry, marked simply “May,” reads
in part:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The trasistion of changing full love from Ella to Marina was
very painfull esp. as I saw Ella almost every day at the factory
but as the days &amp; weeks went by I adjusted more and more [to]
my wife mentaly * * * She is maddly in love with me from
the very start. Boat rides on Lake Minsk walks through the
parks evening at home or at Aunt Valia’s place mark May.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-681" href="#Footnote_A13-681" class="fnanchor">A13-681</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And in June: “A continuence of May, except that; we draw closer
and closer, and I think very little now of Ella.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-682" href="#Footnote_A13-682" class="fnanchor">A13-682</a></p>

<p>Sometime within the first month or two after they were married
Oswald told his wife that he was anxious to return to the United States.
The diary says that he told her “in the last days” of June and that
she was “slightly startled” but encouraged him to do as he wished.<a id="FNanchor_A13-683" href="#Footnote_A13-683" class="fnanchor">A13-683</a>
Marina’s recollection is that she learned of his plan between May and
July. Embassy records show that Oswald notified the Embassy in a
letter received on May 25 that he was married and his wife would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_705">705</span>
seek to accompany him to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-684" href="#Footnote_A13-684" class="fnanchor">A13-684</a> At about this time, the
Oswalds began to make inquiries in Soviet offices about exit visas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-685" href="#Footnote_A13-685" class="fnanchor">A13-685</a></p>

<p>While these preparations were being made, the Oswalds apparently
enjoyed their new life.<a id="FNanchor_A13-686" href="#Footnote_A13-686" class="fnanchor">A13-686</a> They ate most of their meals in cafes or at
restaurants where they worked.<a id="FNanchor_A13-687" href="#Footnote_A13-687" class="fnanchor">A13-687</a> For amusement, they went boating,
attended the opera, concerts, the circus, and films; occasionally, they
gathered with a group of friends for a cooperative meal at someone’s
apartment.<a id="FNanchor_A13-688" href="#Footnote_A13-688" class="fnanchor">A13-688</a> His Russian improved, but he retained an accent and
never learned to speak grammatically or to write well.<a id="FNanchor_A13-689" href="#Footnote_A13-689" class="fnanchor">A13-689</a> He read
the English language edition of the Daily Worker and books, also
in English, on Marxism and Leninism; he also read some Russian
newspapers.<a id="FNanchor_A13-690" href="#Footnote_A13-690" class="fnanchor">A13-690</a></p>

<p>Before he married Marina (and presumably before February, when
he had begun his efforts to return to the United States) Oswald had
applied for admission to the Patrice Lumumba Friendship University
in Moscow. He received a letter dated May 3 apologizing for the delay
in responding to his application and turning it down on the ground
that the university had been established exclusively for students from
the underdeveloped countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.<a id="FNanchor_A13-691" href="#Footnote_A13-691" class="fnanchor">A13-691</a>
Oswald expressed his disappointment at having been turned down
to Marina.<a id="FNanchor_A13-692" href="#Footnote_A13-692" class="fnanchor">A13-692</a></p>

<p>Oswald reopened his correspondence with his family on May 5,
with a friendly letter to his brother Robert. He said nothing about
his contacts with the American Embassy, but mentioned that he had
married, and that he had a job as a “metal-smith” and was living well.
He asked his brother for their mother’s address, and encouraged him
to come to Minsk for a visit.<a id="FNanchor_A13-693" href="#Footnote_A13-693" class="fnanchor">A13-693</a> Robert answered the letter quickly.
On May 31, Oswald wrote again and expressed his pleasure at having
heard from Robert after so long. Apparently in response to an offer
to send him whatever he needed, Oswald wrote that he needed nothing
and thanked Robert for the thought; he suggested, however, that
Marina might like a small wedding present. At the end of the letter
he said that he did not know whether he would ever return to the
United States; he said that before he could return he would have to
obtain the permission of the Soviet Union for him and Marina to leave
and insure that no charges would be lodged against him in the United
States. In this letter, he mentioned that he was in touch with the
Embassy in Moscow.<a id="FNanchor_A13-694" href="#Footnote_A13-694" class="fnanchor">A13-694</a> At about this time, Oswald wrote also to
his mother.<a id="FNanchor_A13-695" href="#Footnote_A13-695" class="fnanchor">A13-695</a></p>

<p>On May 25, the Embassy received a letter mailed in Minsk about
10 days before, in which Oswald asked for assurances that he would
not be prosecuted if he returned to the United States, and informed
the Embassy that he had married a Russian woman who would want
to accompany him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-696" href="#Footnote_A13-696" class="fnanchor">A13-696</a> The Embassy communicated this development
to Washington<a id="FNanchor_A13-697" href="#Footnote_A13-697" class="fnanchor">A13-697</a> and did not answer Oswald immediately. In
addition, he had had no word since March concerning the return of
his passport. Impatient for action,<a id="FNanchor_A13-698" href="#Footnote_A13-698" class="fnanchor">A13-698</a> he appeared without warning
at the Embassy on July 8; it was a Saturday and the offices were
closed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-699" href="#Footnote_A13-699" class="fnanchor">A13-699</a> He used the house telephone to reach Snyder, who came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_706">706</span>
to the office, talked with him briefly, and suggested that he return on
the following Monday.<a id="FNanchor_A13-700" href="#Footnote_A13-700" class="fnanchor">A13-700</a> Oswald called Marina and asked her to
join him in Moscow. She arrived on Sunday, July 9,<a id="FNanchor_A13-701" href="#Footnote_A13-701" class="fnanchor">A13-701</a> and they took
a room at the Hotel Berlin,<a id="FNanchor_A13-702" href="#Footnote_A13-702" class="fnanchor">A13-702</a> where he had stayed when he first
arrived in Russia.</p>

<p>Oswald returned to the Embassy on Monday. Marina waited outside
during his interview with Snyder,<a id="FNanchor_A13-703" href="#Footnote_A13-703" class="fnanchor">A13-703</a> who asked to see Oswald’s
Soviet papers and questioned him closely about his life in Russia and
possible expatriating acts. Oswald stated that he was not a citizen
of the Soviet Union and had never formally applied for citizenship,
that he had never taken an oath of allegiance to the Soviet Union,
and that he was not a member of the factory trade union organization.
He said that he had never given Soviet officials any confidential information
that he had learned in the Marines, had never been asked
to give such information, and “doubted” that he would have done so
had he been asked.<a id="FNanchor_A13-704" href="#Footnote_A13-704" class="fnanchor">A13-704</a> Some of Oswald’s statements during this interview
were undoubtedly false. He had almost certainly applied for
citizenship in the Soviet Union<a id="FNanchor_A13-705" href="#Footnote_A13-705" class="fnanchor">A13-705</a> and, at least for a time, been disappointed
when it was denied.<a id="FNanchor_A13-706" href="#Footnote_A13-706" class="fnanchor">A13-706</a> He possessed a membership card in
the union organization.<a id="FNanchor_A13-707" href="#Footnote_A13-707" class="fnanchor">A13-707</a> In addition, his assertion to Snyder that
he had never been questioned by Soviet authorities concerning his
life in the United States is simply unbelievable.</p>

<p>Oswald showed anxiety, already displayed in his letters, that he
might be prosecuted and imprisoned if he returned to the United
States. Snyder told him informally that he did not know any grounds
on which he would be prosecuted but that he could give no assurances
in this regard.<a id="FNanchor_A13-708" href="#Footnote_A13-708" class="fnanchor">A13-708</a> Snyder testified that Oswald seemed to have matured
while he was in Russia and did not show the bravado and arrogance
which characterized his first contacts with the Embassy.
Oswald told him that he had “learned a hard lesson the hard way”
and had acquired a new appreciation of the United States and the
meaning of freedom.<a id="FNanchor_A13-709" href="#Footnote_A13-709" class="fnanchor">A13-709</a></p>

<p>Since Oswald’s passport would expire on September 10, 1961,<a id="FNanchor_A13-710" href="#Footnote_A13-710" class="fnanchor">A13-710</a>
before which date he probably would not be able to obtain Russian
exit papers, he filled out an application for its renewal.<a id="FNanchor_A13-711" href="#Footnote_A13-711" class="fnanchor">A13-711</a> On a questionnaire
attached to the application,<a id="FNanchor_A13-712" href="#Footnote_A13-712" class="fnanchor">A13-712</a> he reiterated his oral statements
that he had obtained only a residence permit in the Soviet
Union and was still an American national. On the basis of Oswald’s
written and oral statements, Snyder concluded that he had not expatriated
himself and returned his passport, stamped valid only for
direct travel to the United States,<a id="FNanchor_A13-713" href="#Footnote_A13-713" class="fnanchor">A13-713</a> to him. Accompanied by his
wife,<a id="FNanchor_A13-714" href="#Footnote_A13-714" class="fnanchor">A13-714</a> Oswald came to the Embassy again on the following day,<a id="FNanchor_A13-715" href="#Footnote_A13-715" class="fnanchor">A13-715</a> to
initiate procedures for her admission to the United States as an immigrant;
they had a routine interview with McVickar, Snyder’s assistant.<a id="FNanchor_A13-716" href="#Footnote_A13-716" class="fnanchor">A13-716</a>
Three days later, they returned to Minsk.<a id="FNanchor_A13-717" href="#Footnote_A13-717" class="fnanchor">A13-717</a></p>

<p>On the same day, Oswald wrote to his brother. He told Robert that
he had his passport again and that he and Marina were doing everything
possible to leave the Soviet Union. Apparently referring to his
initial reappearance at the Embassy in quest of his passport, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_707">707</span>
wrote: “I could write a book about how many feeling have come and
gone since that day.” The letter closed with an affectionate greeting
to his brother and his family.<a id="FNanchor_A13-718" href="#Footnote_A13-718" class="fnanchor">A13-718</a> The letter’s tone of firm purpose to
return to the United States in the face of heavy odds reflected Oswald’s
attitude thereafter.</p>

<p>As soon as they returned to Minsk, the Oswalds began to work with
local authorities for permission to leave the country.<a id="FNanchor_A13-719" href="#Footnote_A13-719" class="fnanchor">A13-719</a> His diary
entry for July 16 through August 20 reads,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We have found out which blanks and certificates are nessceary to
apply for a exit visa. They number about 20 papers; birth
certificates, affidavit, photos, ect. On Aug 20th we give the
papers out they say it will be 3½ months before we know wheather
they let us go or not. In the meantime Marina has had to stade 4
differant meeting at the place of work held by her boss’s at the
direction of “someone” by phone. The Young Comm. leauge
headquttes also called about her and she had to go see them for
1½ hours. The purpose (expressed) is to disuade her from going
to the U.S.A. Net effect: Make her more stubborn about wanting
to go. Marina is pregnet. We only hope that the visas come
through soon.<a id="FNanchor_A13-720" href="#Footnote_A13-720" class="fnanchor">A13-720</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In a letter dated July 15, he reported their efforts to the Embassy,
and said that he would keep it informed “as to the overall picture.”
The letter mentioned that Marina was having difficulties at work because
of her decision to leave but added that such “tactics” were “quite
useless” and that Marina had “stood up well, without getting into
trouble.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-721" href="#Footnote_A13-721" class="fnanchor">A13-721</a> For August 21 through September 1, the diary reads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I make repeated trips to the passport &amp; visa office, also to
Ministry of For. Affairs in Minsk, also Min. of Internal Affairs,
all of which have a say in the granting of a visa. I extrackted
promises of quick attention to us.<a id="FNanchor_A13-722" href="#Footnote_A13-722" class="fnanchor">A13-722</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">For September through October 18, “No word from Min. (‘They’ll
call us.’).”<a id="FNanchor_A13-723" href="#Footnote_A13-723" class="fnanchor">A13-723</a></p>

<p>Marina testified that when the news of her visit to the American
Embassy in July reached Minsk, she was dropped from membership in
“Komsomol,” the Communist Youth Organization,<a id="FNanchor_A13-724" href="#Footnote_A13-724" class="fnanchor">A13-724</a> and that “meetings
were arranged” at which “members of the various organizations”
attempted to dissuade her from leaving the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_A13-725" href="#Footnote_A13-725" class="fnanchor">A13-725</a> Her
aunt and uncle did not speak to her for “a long time.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-726" href="#Footnote_A13-726" class="fnanchor">A13-726</a> Paul Gregory,
to whom Marina taught Russian in the United States, testified
that she once referred to this period of her life in Minsk as “a very
horrible time.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-727" href="#Footnote_A13-727" class="fnanchor">A13-727</a></p>

<p>Oswald wrote to the Embassy again on October 4, to request that
the U.S. Government officially intervene to facilitate his and his wife’s
applications for exit visas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-728" href="#Footnote_A13-728" class="fnanchor">A13-728</a> He stated that there had been “systematic
and concerted attempts to intimidate [Marina] * * * into withdrawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_708">708</span>
her application for a visa” which had resulted in her being
hospitalized for a 5-day period on September 22 for “nervous exhaustion.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-729" href="#Footnote_A13-729" class="fnanchor">A13-729</a>
Marina has denied that she was hospitalized for a
nervous disorder<a id="FNanchor_A13-730" href="#Footnote_A13-730" class="fnanchor">A13-730</a> and he made no mention of it in his diary or letters
to his family; he probably lied to the Embassy. The Embassy replied
to his letter on October 12, saying that it had no way of influencing
Soviet conduct on such matters and that its experience had been that
action on applications for exit visas was “seldom taken rapidly.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-731" href="#Footnote_A13-731" class="fnanchor">A13-731</a></p>

<p>In October 1961 Marina took her annual vacation.<a id="FNanchor_A13-732" href="#Footnote_A13-732" class="fnanchor">A13-732</a> She and Oswald
agreed that she should get a “change of scenery,”<a id="FNanchor_A13-733" href="#Footnote_A13-733" class="fnanchor">A13-733</a> and she spent
about 3 weeks with an aunt in Khar’kov. It is possible that they were
not getting along well together during this period.<a id="FNanchor_A13-734" href="#Footnote_A13-734" class="fnanchor">A13-734</a> A diary entry
after her return indicates that they were having some quarrels and that
she was wavering in her decision to go to the United States, which Oswald
attributed to anxiety about their applications for visas and the
fact that she was pregnant; he in turn dreaded the approach of the
“hard Russian winter.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-735" href="#Footnote_A13-735" class="fnanchor">A13-735</a> He noted in his diary that he was lonely
while she was gone, but that he and his friend “Erich,” presumably
Erik Titovyets, went to some dances and other public amusements.<a id="FNanchor_A13-736" href="#Footnote_A13-736" class="fnanchor">A13-736</a>
On his 22nd birthday he went alone to see his favorite opera, “The
Queen of Spades.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-737" href="#Footnote_A13-737" class="fnanchor">A13-737</a> Marina sent him a gold and silver cup, inscribed
“To my dear husband on his birthday, 18/x/61” and other gifts, for
which he wrote to thank her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-738" href="#Footnote_A13-738" class="fnanchor">A13-738</a> She returned on November 12, in Oswald’s
words, “radient, with several jars of preserses for me from her
aunt.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-739" href="#Footnote_A13-739" class="fnanchor">A13-739</a></p>

<p>Sometime after Marina’s return Oswald applied for an interview
with Col. Nicolay Aksenov, an official in the local MVD, in an effort
to expedite their application for exit visas; he was told by the
colonel’s subordinates that they were competent to handle the matter.
Oswald then insisted that Marina seek an interview; she agreed reluctantly.
The interview was granted;<a id="FNanchor_A13-740" href="#Footnote_A13-740" class="fnanchor">A13-740</a> Marina thought that this
might have been due to the fact that her uncle was also a high-ranking
official in the Minsk MVD, but she did not believe that he would personally
have presumed on his official position to obtain special treatment.<a id="FNanchor_A13-741" href="#Footnote_A13-741" class="fnanchor">A13-741</a>
Colonel Aksenov questioned her about her reasons for
wanting to go to the United States and, noticing that she was
pregnant, suggested that she at least delay her departure so that her
child could be born in Russia, but did not otherwise try to discourage
her. He finally told her that there were many others seeking visas and
that she and her husband would have to wait their turn.<a id="FNanchor_A13-742" href="#Footnote_A13-742" class="fnanchor">A13-742</a></p>

<p>Throughout this period, Oswald continued to correspond with his
mother and brother. His letters contained the usual chatter among
members of a family and occasional references to the progress of the
visa applications.<a id="FNanchor_A13-743" href="#Footnote_A13-743" class="fnanchor">A13-743</a> He wrote to the Embassy on November 1, saying
that if, as he anticipated, his residence permit were renewed in
January for another year, it would be over his protest.<a id="FNanchor_A13-744" href="#Footnote_A13-744" class="fnanchor">A13-744</a> On November
13 the Embassy replied, telling Oswald that retention of his Soviet
passport, which was of the kind issued to persons considered to be
stateless, or an extension of it, would not prejudice his claim to American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_709">709</span>
citizenship. The letter added that he could discuss the renewal
of his American passport whenever he appeared in person at the
Embassy to do so.<a id="FNanchor_A13-745" href="#Footnote_A13-745" class="fnanchor">A13-745</a></p>

<p>Late in December, Oswald wrote a letter to Senator John G. Tower
of Texas, which was received in Washington near the end of January.
He stated that he was an American citizen and that the Soviet Government
refused to permit him and his wife to leave the Soviet Union.
He asked Senator Tower to raise “the question of holding by the
Soviet Union of a citizen of the U.S., against his will and expressed
desires.” The letter was referred to the State Department and no
further action concerning it was taken.<a id="FNanchor_A13-746" href="#Footnote_A13-746" class="fnanchor">A13-746</a> On December 25, Marina
was called to the Soviet Passport Office and told that exit visas would
be granted to her and her husband; she was surprised, having doubted
that she would ever be permitted to leave. Oswald wrote to the Embassy
on December 27 that they would be given visas and asked that
his passport be extended without another trip to Moscow; he added,
however, that he would come to Moscow if this would expedite the
processing of his application. In his diary, he wrote, “It’s great (I
think?).”<a id="FNanchor_A13-747" href="#Footnote_A13-747" class="fnanchor">A13-747</a> Before the year ended, Marina went on maternity leave
from her job.<a id="FNanchor_A13-748" href="#Footnote_A13-748" class="fnanchor">A13-748</a> They spent New Year’s Eve at a dinner party given
by the Zigers.<a id="FNanchor_A13-749" href="#Footnote_A13-749" class="fnanchor">A13-749</a></p>

<p>Oswald wrote to his mother on January 2, 1962, and told her that he
and his wife expected to arrive in the United States sometime around
March. He asked her to contact the local Red Cross and request that
it put his case before the International Rescue Committee or some
other group which aids immigrants to the United States. He told
her that he would need about $800 and that she should insist on a
gift rather than a loan; he told her not to send any of her own money.<a id="FNanchor_A13-750" href="#Footnote_A13-750" class="fnanchor">A13-750</a>
Despite his instructions, she requested a loan from the Red Cross.<a id="FNanchor_A13-751" href="#Footnote_A13-751" class="fnanchor">A13-751</a>
On January 13, Oswald wrote to the International Rescue Committee
himself; he asked for $800 with which to purchase two tickets from
Moscow to Texas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-752" href="#Footnote_A13-752" class="fnanchor">A13-752</a> He wrote to the Committee again on January 26,
this time asking for $1,000.<a id="FNanchor_A13-753" href="#Footnote_A13-753" class="fnanchor">A13-753</a></p>

<p>In the meantime, letters of Oswald<a id="FNanchor_A13-754" href="#Footnote_A13-754" class="fnanchor">A13-754</a> and the American Embassy,<a id="FNanchor_A13-755" href="#Footnote_A13-755" class="fnanchor">A13-755</a>
both dated January 5, crossed in the mail. The Embassy’s letter
suggested that since there might be difficulties in obtaining an American
visa for Marina, he consider returning alone and bringing her over
later. He replied on the 16th that he would not leave Russia without
her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-756" href="#Footnote_A13-756" class="fnanchor">A13-756</a> In his letter, Oswald requested that the U.S. Government
loan him the money for his and Marina’s airplane tickets or arrange
a loan from another source. The Embassy replied on January 15
that Marina had not yet obtained an American visa and that no
evidence had yet been submitted that she would not become a public
charge in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-757" href="#Footnote_A13-757" class="fnanchor">A13-757</a> It suggested that Oswald’s mother
or some other close relative file an affidavit of support in Marina’s
behalf. Before receiving this letter, Oswald wrote out such a document
himself<a id="FNanchor_A13-758" href="#Footnote_A13-758" class="fnanchor">A13-758</a> and mailed it to the Embassy.<a id="FNanchor_A13-759" href="#Footnote_A13-759" class="fnanchor">A13-759</a></p>

<p>On January 23, after receiving the Embassy’s letter, he wrote that
his own affidavit should be sufficient, since he had been away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_710">710</span>
the United States for more than 2 years and could not be expected to
obtain an affidavit from someone else.<a id="FNanchor_A13-760" href="#Footnote_A13-760" class="fnanchor">A13-760</a> But on the same day, he wrote
to his mother asking that she file an affidavit of support with the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.<a id="FNanchor_A13-761" href="#Footnote_A13-761" class="fnanchor">A13-761</a> On January 24, the Embassy
acknowledged receipt of his affidavit, but again suggested that
he obtain one from someone else.<a id="FNanchor_A13-762" href="#Footnote_A13-762" class="fnanchor">A13-762</a></p>

<p>Late in January, Oswald received a letter from his mother telling
him that he had been given a dishonorable discharge from the Marines.<a id="FNanchor_A13-763" href="#Footnote_A13-763" class="fnanchor">A13-763</a>
(The discharge had actually been “undesirable,” a less derogatory
characterization.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-764" href="#Footnote_A13-764" class="fnanchor">A13-764</a> This apparently revived his fear of
prosecution, and on January 30, he wrote to his brother for more
information.<a id="FNanchor_A13-765" href="#Footnote_A13-765" class="fnanchor">A13-765</a> On the same day he wrote also to John B. Connally,
Jr., then Governor of Texas, who Oswald believed was still Secretary
of Navy. The letter read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wish to call your attention to a case about which you may have
personal knowlege since you are a resident of Ft. Worth as I am.</p>

<p>In November 1959 an event was well publicated in the Ft.
Worth newspapers concerning a person who had gone to the Soviet
Union to reside for a short time, (much in the same way
E. Hemingway resided in Paris.)</p>

<p>This person in answers to questions put to him by reporteds in
Moscow criticized certain facets of american life. The story was
blown up into another “turncoat” sensation, with the result that
the Navy department gave this person a belated dishonourable
discharge, although he had received an honourable discharge after
three years service on Sept. 11, 1959 at El Toro, Marine corps
base in California.</p>

<p>These are the basic facts of <em>my</em> case.</p>

<p>I have and allways had the full sanction of the U.S. Embassy,
Moscow USSR, and hence the U.S. goverment. In as much as
I am returning to the U.S.A. in this year with the aid of the U.S.
Embassy, bring with me my family (since I married in the
USSR) I shall employ all means to right this gross mistake or
injustice to a boni-fied U.S. citizen and <em>ex</em>-service man. The
U.S. government has no charges or complaints against me. I ask
you to look into this case and take the neccessary steps to repair
the damage done to me and my family. For information I would
direct you to consult the American Embassy, Chikovski St. 19/21,
Moscow, USSR.<a id="FNanchor_A13-766" href="#Footnote_A13-766" class="fnanchor">A13-766</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Connally referred the letter to the Department of the Navy,<a id="FNanchor_A13-767" href="#Footnote_A13-767" class="fnanchor">A13-767</a> which
sent Oswald a letter stating that the Department contemplated no
change in the undesirable discharge.<a id="FNanchor_A13-768" href="#Footnote_A13-768" class="fnanchor">A13-768</a> On March 22, Oswald wrote
to the Department insisting that his discharge be given a further, full
review.<a id="FNanchor_A13-769" href="#Footnote_A13-769" class="fnanchor">A13-769</a> The Department promptly replied that it had no
authority to hear and review petitions of this sort and referred
Oswald to the Navy Discharge Review Board.<a id="FNanchor_A13-770" href="#Footnote_A13-770" class="fnanchor">A13-770</a> Oswald filled out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_711">711</span>
the enclosed application for review in Minsk but did not mail it until
he returned to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-771" href="#Footnote_A13-771" class="fnanchor">A13-771</a></p>

<p>The Department of State had notified Oswald’s mother that it
would need $900 to make the travel arrangements for her son and
daughter-in-law.<a id="FNanchor_A13-772" href="#Footnote_A13-772" class="fnanchor">A13-772</a> On February 1, Oswald sent his mother a brief
letter rejecting her suggestion that she try to raise money by telling the
newspapers about his financial plight.<a id="FNanchor_A13-773" href="#Footnote_A13-773" class="fnanchor">A13-773</a> Five days later, the Embassy
wrote to Oswald and asked him to make formal application for a
loan.<a id="FNanchor_A13-774" href="#Footnote_A13-774" class="fnanchor">A13-774</a> Oswald wrote to his mother again on February 9, reminding
her to file an affidavit of support and asking that she send him clippings
from the Fort Worth newspapers about his defection to
Russia, a request which he later repeated to his brother. He told her
that he wanted to know what had been written about him, so that
he could be “forewarned.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-775" href="#Footnote_A13-775" class="fnanchor">A13-775</a></p>

<p>Oswald took Marina to the hospital on the morning of February 15.
A baby girl was born at about 10 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_A13-776" href="#Footnote_A13-776" class="fnanchor">A13-776</a> He had gone on to the factory
where news of the birth awaited him on his arrival.<a id="FNanchor_A13-777" href="#Footnote_A13-777" class="fnanchor">A13-777</a> In accordance
with regular hospital practice,<a id="FNanchor_A13-778" href="#Footnote_A13-778" class="fnanchor">A13-778</a> he did not see the baby until Marina
left the hospital.<a id="FNanchor_A13-779" href="#Footnote_A13-779" class="fnanchor">A13-779</a> He was excited by the child,<a id="FNanchor_A13-780" href="#Footnote_A13-780" class="fnanchor">A13-780</a> who was named
“June Lee” in accordance with the Russian custom and law that a
child’s second name must be the father’s first name or a variation of it.
He had wanted to name his child “June Marina,” and protested the application
of the law to her, since he had a United States passport.
His diary contains the wry comment, “Po-Russki.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-781" href="#Footnote_A13-781" class="fnanchor">A13-781</a> His coworkers
at the factory gave the Oswalds “one summer blanket, 6 light diapers,
4 warm diapers, 2 chemises, 3 very good warm chemises, 4 very nice
suits and two toys” for the baby.<a id="FNanchor_A13-782" href="#Footnote_A13-782" class="fnanchor">A13-782</a> Marina came home on February
23.<a id="FNanchor_A13-783" href="#Footnote_A13-783" class="fnanchor">A13-783</a></p>

<p>There was less urgency about the departure for the United States
after June Lee was born.<a id="FNanchor_A13-784" href="#Footnote_A13-784" class="fnanchor">A13-784</a> Oswald wrote to his mother,<a id="FNanchor_A13-785" href="#Footnote_A13-785" class="fnanchor">A13-785</a> and
brother,<a id="FNanchor_A13-786" href="#Footnote_A13-786" class="fnanchor">A13-786</a> that he would probably not arrive for several months.
The Embassy received a letter on March 3, in which Oswald applied
for a loan of $800;<a id="FNanchor_A13-787" href="#Footnote_A13-787" class="fnanchor">A13-787</a> the Embassy replied that it was authorized to
loan him only $500.<a id="FNanchor_A13-788" href="#Footnote_A13-788" class="fnanchor">A13-788</a> It had in the meantime decided that his own
affidavit of support for Marina would be sufficient under the circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_A13-789" href="#Footnote_A13-789" class="fnanchor">A13-789</a>
On March 15, he received notification from the Immigration
and Naturalization Service that Marina’s application for a visa
had been approved.<a id="FNanchor_A13-790" href="#Footnote_A13-790" class="fnanchor">A13-790</a> By March 28, he had received an affidavit of
support in Marina’s behalf from his mother’s employer, Byron K.
Phillips,<a id="FNanchor_A13-791" href="#Footnote_A13-791" class="fnanchor">A13-791</a> which he filed although it was no longer necessary to do
so.<a id="FNanchor_A13-792" href="#Footnote_A13-792" class="fnanchor">A13-792</a> A few days before, Marina, still on maternity leave,
had quit her job.<a id="FNanchor_A13-793" href="#Footnote_A13-793" class="fnanchor">A13-793</a> Discussions with the Embassy to complete
financial and travel arrangements continued in April and
May.<a id="FNanchor_A13-794" href="#Footnote_A13-794" class="fnanchor">A13-794</a> In a letter to Robert on April 12, Oswald wrote that only
“the American side” was holding up their departure, but added that
the winter being over, he didn’t “really * * * want to leave until the
beginning of fall, since the spring and summer * * * [in Russia] are
so nice.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_712">712</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-795" href="#Footnote_A13-795" class="fnanchor">A13-795</a></p>

<p>On May 10, the Embassy wrote that everything was in order and
suggested that Oswald come to the Embassy with his family to sign
the final papers.<a id="FNanchor_A13-796" href="#Footnote_A13-796" class="fnanchor">A13-796</a> At his request,<a id="FNanchor_A13-797" href="#Footnote_A13-797" class="fnanchor">A13-797</a> he was discharged from the
factory on about May 18.<a id="FNanchor_A13-798" href="#Footnote_A13-798" class="fnanchor">A13-798</a> His work had apparently never been very
good. Marina testified that he was rather lazy and resented having to
take orders.<a id="FNanchor_A13-799" href="#Footnote_A13-799" class="fnanchor">A13-799</a> This estimate is confirmed by a report of the plant director
and personnel department chief, filed on December 11, 1961,
which was apparently a routine assessment of his work. The report
noted that he did not “display the initiative for increasing his skill” in
his job, that he was “over-sensitive * * * to remarks from the foremen,
and * * * careless in his work”; Oswald took “no part in the social
life of the shop” and kept “very much to himself.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-800" href="#Footnote_A13-800" class="fnanchor">A13-800</a></p>

<p>Oswald picked up his Soviet exit visa on May 22;<a id="FNanchor_A13-801" href="#Footnote_A13-801" class="fnanchor">A13-801</a> at about this
time, he also had an interview with an official of the MVD to
obtain final clearance for his departure.<a id="FNanchor_A13-802" href="#Footnote_A13-802" class="fnanchor">A13-802</a> He wrote to Robert that he
and his family would leave for Moscow on the following day and depart
for England 10 to 14 days later. He expected to cross the Atlantic
by ship, probably docking in New Orleans. Returning to a point
which he had made in an earlier letter to his mother, he commented
that he knew from the newspaper clippings what Robert had said
about him when he left for Russia; he thought that Robert had talked
too much at that time, and asked that Robert say nothing to the
newspapers now.<a id="FNanchor_A13-803" href="#Footnote_A13-803" class="fnanchor">A13-803</a></p>

<p>The Oswalds arrived in Moscow by May 24<a id="FNanchor_A13-804" href="#Footnote_A13-804" class="fnanchor">A13-804</a> and on that date
filled out various documents at the American Embassy;<a id="FNanchor_A13-805" href="#Footnote_A13-805" class="fnanchor">A13-805</a> Marina
was given her American visa.<a id="FNanchor_A13-806" href="#Footnote_A13-806" class="fnanchor">A13-806</a> Final arrangements for their emigration
were made with Soviet officials.<a id="FNanchor_A13-807" href="#Footnote_A13-807" class="fnanchor">A13-807</a> On June 1, Oswald signed a
promissory note at the Embassy for a repatriation loan of $435.71.<a id="FNanchor_A13-808" href="#Footnote_A13-808" class="fnanchor">A13-808</a>
He and his family boarded a train for Holland,<a id="FNanchor_A13-809" href="#Footnote_A13-809" class="fnanchor">A13-809</a> which passed
through Minsk that night.<a id="FNanchor_A13-810" href="#Footnote_A13-810" class="fnanchor">A13-810</a> They crossed the Soviet frontier at
Brest on June 2. Two days later, they departed from Holland on the
SS <i>Maasdam</i>.<a id="FNanchor_A13-811" href="#Footnote_A13-811" class="fnanchor">A13-811</a> Onboard ship, the Oswalds stayed by themselves;
Marina testified that she did not often go on deck because she was
poorly dressed and Oswald was ashamed of her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-812" href="#Footnote_A13-812" class="fnanchor">A13-812</a></p>

<p>Probably while he was on board the <i>Maasdam</i> Oswald wrote some
notes on ship stationery, which appear to be a summary of what he
thought he had learned by living under both the capitalist and Communist
systems. The notes reflect his unhappy and deepening feeling
of disillusionment with both the Soviet Union and the United States.
Oswald observed that although reform groups may oppose the government
in power, they always declare that they are for their people and
their country, and he asked what “would happen if somebody was to
stand up and say he was utterly opposed not only to the governments,
but to the people, too the entire land and complete foundations” of
his society. He condemned existing political groups and proposed
the formation of a third choice between communism and capitalism,
neither of which was acceptable to him. “I have lived,” he said,
“under both systems, I have <em>sought</em> the answers and although it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_713">713</span>
be very easy to dupe myself into believing one system is better than
the other, I know they are not.” In these notes, he acknowledged
that his “Red Cross” subsidy had been paid by the Soviet Government
rather than the international organization, and said, “I shall
never sell myself intentionlly, or unintentionlly to anyone again.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-813" href="#Footnote_A13-813" class="fnanchor">A13-813</a>
(Commission Exhibit No. 25, <a href="#Page_273">p. 273</a>.) It was probably also onboard
ship that Oswald wrote two sets of answers to questions which he
anticipated about his decision to go to Russia and later to return to
the United States. Although the sets of answers are somewhat
similar, but the tone of one is apologetic, while the other suggests
that Oswald went to Russia to study the Soviet system, but remained
a loyal American and owed no apologies.<a id="FNanchor_A13-814" href="#Footnote_A13-814" class="fnanchor">A13-814</a></p>

<p>The <i>Maasdam</i> landed at Hoboken, N.J., on June 13.<a id="FNanchor_A13-815" href="#Footnote_A13-815" class="fnanchor">A13-815</a> The Oswalds
were met by Spas T. Raikin, a representative of the Traveler’s
Aid Society, which had been contacted by the Department of
State; Raikin had the impression that Oswald was trying to avoid
meeting anyone. He told Raikin that he had only $63 and had no plans
either for that night or for travel to Fort Worth, and accepted the society’s
help, according to Raikin, “with confidence and appreciation.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-816" href="#Footnote_A13-816" class="fnanchor">A13-816</a>
They passed through the immigration office without
incident,<a id="FNanchor_A13-817" href="#Footnote_A13-817" class="fnanchor">A13-817</a> and Raikin helped them through customs.<a id="FNanchor_A13-818" href="#Footnote_A13-818" class="fnanchor">A13-818</a></p>

<p>The society referred the Oswalds to the New York City Department
of Welfare, which helped them find a room at the Times Square
Hotel.<a id="FNanchor_A13-819" href="#Footnote_A13-819" class="fnanchor">A13-819</a> Oswald told both Raikin and representatives of the welfare
department that he had been a marine stationed at the American
Embassy in Moscow, had married a Russian girl, renounced his citizenship,
and worked in Minsk; he soon found out, he said, that the
Russian propaganda was inaccurate but had not been able to obtain
an exit visa for his wife and child for more than 2 years. He said
also that he had paid the travel expenses himself.<a id="FNanchor_A13-820" href="#Footnote_A13-820" class="fnanchor">A13-820</a></p>

<p>The welfare department called Robert Oswald’s home in Fort
Worth. His wife answered and said that they would help. She contacted
her husband who sent $200 immediately.<a id="FNanchor_A13-821" href="#Footnote_A13-821" class="fnanchor">A13-821</a> Oswald refused to
accept the money and insisted that the department itself should pay
the fare to Texas; he threatened that they would go as far as they
could on $63 and rely on local authorities to get them the rest of the
way. In the end he accepted the money.<a id="FNanchor_A13-822" href="#Footnote_A13-822" class="fnanchor">A13-822</a> On the afternoon of June
14, the Oswalds left New York by plane for Fort Worth.<a id="FNanchor_A13-823" href="#Footnote_A13-823" class="fnanchor">A13-823</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr246">FORT WORTH, DALLAS, NEW ORLEANS</h3>

<p>Oswald had originally indicated that he and his family would stay
with his mother in Vernon, Tex.<a id="FNanchor_A13-824" href="#Footnote_A13-824" class="fnanchor">A13-824</a> His decision to stay with Robert
Oswald in Fort Worth apparently had been prompted by his brother’s
invitation in a letter to him in Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-825" href="#Footnote_A13-825" class="fnanchor">A13-825</a> Oswald listed only his
brother as a relative on an “Intake Interview” form which he prepared
for the New York Department of Welfare.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_714">714</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-826" href="#Footnote_A13-826" class="fnanchor">A13-826</a></p>

<p>Robert took his wife and children to Love Field, the Dallas airport,
to meet Lee and Marina and their baby, June Lee.<a id="FNanchor_A13-827" href="#Footnote_A13-827" class="fnanchor">A13-827</a> He testified
that the most noticeable change in his brother’s appearance was that
he had become rather bald; he seemed also to be somewhat thinner than
he had been in 1959. Robert thought that his brother had picked up
“something of an accent” but, except for these changes was “the same
boy” whom he had known before.<a id="FNanchor_A13-828" href="#Footnote_A13-828" class="fnanchor">A13-828</a> Lee commented on the absence
of newspaper reporters and seemed to Robert to be disappointed that
none had appeared.<a id="FNanchor_A13-829" href="#Footnote_A13-829" class="fnanchor">A13-829</a> Later on, Lee was anxious to avoid publicity.<a id="FNanchor_A13-830" href="#Footnote_A13-830" class="fnanchor">A13-830</a></p>

<p>Robert drove the Oswalds to his home at 7313 Davenport Street.<a id="FNanchor_A13-831" href="#Footnote_A13-831" class="fnanchor">A13-831</a>
For a few days, Lee seemed tense,<a id="FNanchor_A13-832" href="#Footnote_A13-832" class="fnanchor">A13-832</a> but the brothers got along well,<a id="FNanchor_A13-833" href="#Footnote_A13-833" class="fnanchor">A13-833</a>
and to Robert it was “more or less * * * [as if Lee] had not been to
Russia”; they were “just together again.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-834" href="#Footnote_A13-834" class="fnanchor">A13-834</a> They did not discuss
politics, according to Robert because of a “tacit agreement” between
them.<a id="FNanchor_A13-835" href="#Footnote_A13-835" class="fnanchor">A13-835</a> Lee indicated to his brother that he hoped to have his
undesirable discharge from the Marines corrected.<a id="FNanchor_A13-836" href="#Footnote_A13-836" class="fnanchor">A13-836</a> Robert and his
wife “took to Marina and June,” and enjoyed showing Marina “things
that she had never seen before.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-837" href="#Footnote_A13-837" class="fnanchor">A13-837</a> Marina rested and took care of
her baby, and when she could, helped in the household.<a id="FNanchor_A13-838" href="#Footnote_A13-838" class="fnanchor">A13-838</a> She
testified that, apart from a trip to the library, Lee spent about a week
“merely talking.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-839" href="#Footnote_A13-839" class="fnanchor">A13-839</a></p>

<p>On June 18, 4 days after he arrived in Fort Worth, Oswald went
to the office of Mrs. Pauline Virginia Bates, a public stenographer
whose name he had found in the telephone directory,<a id="FNanchor_A13-840" href="#Footnote_A13-840" class="fnanchor">A13-840</a> and asked
her to type a manuscript from the “scraps of paper,” on which he
had recorded his impressions of the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_A13-841" href="#Footnote_A13-841" class="fnanchor">A13-841</a> Intrigued by
his tale that he had just returned from the Soviet Union and had
smuggled his notes out of that country, she agreed to type the notes for
$1 per page or $2 an hour, 50 cents less than her usual hourly rate.<a id="FNanchor_A13-842" href="#Footnote_A13-842" class="fnanchor">A13-842</a>
On that day and the succeeding 2 days, Mrs. Bates spent 8 hours typing
for Oswald while he remained in her office helping her with the notes
and translating portions of them which were in Russian.<a id="FNanchor_A13-843" href="#Footnote_A13-843" class="fnanchor">A13-843</a> At the
end of each session he collected his notes and as much of the manuscript
as she had done and took them away with him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-844" href="#Footnote_A13-844" class="fnanchor">A13-844</a> On June 20,
he gave Mrs. Bates $10 for the 10 completed pages; he told her that
he had no more money and refused to accept her offer to postpone payment
or continue the work for nothing.<a id="FNanchor_A13-845" href="#Footnote_A13-845" class="fnanchor">A13-845</a></p>

<p>Oswald told Mrs. Bates that there was an engineer in Fort Worth
who wanted to help him publish his notes.<a id="FNanchor_A13-846" href="#Footnote_A13-846" class="fnanchor">A13-846</a> On June 19,<a id="FNanchor_A13-847" href="#Footnote_A13-847" class="fnanchor">A13-847</a> he had
called Peter Gregory, a petroleum engineer who was born in Siberia
and taught Russian at the Fort Worth Public Library as a “civic
enterprise.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-848" href="#Footnote_A13-848" class="fnanchor">A13-848</a> He asked if Gregory could give him a letter testifying
to his ability to read and speak Russian, so that he could obtain work
as an interpreter or translator. Gregory suggested that Oswald come
to his office, where Gregory opened a Russian book at random and
asked Oswald to read from it. Oswald read well, and Gregory gave
him the letter he wanted.<a id="FNanchor_A13-849" href="#Footnote_A13-849" class="fnanchor">A13-849</a> Gregory and Oswald had lunch together
and discussed Oswald’s life in the Soviet Union,<a id="FNanchor_A13-850" href="#Footnote_A13-850" class="fnanchor">A13-850</a> but, according to
Gregory’s testimony, nothing was said about publishing Oswald’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_715">715</span>
manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_A13-851" href="#Footnote_A13-851" class="fnanchor">A13-851</a> About a week later, Gregory and his son Paul, a
college student, visited the Oswalds at Robert Oswald’s home and arranged
for Marina to give Paul lessons in Russian during the
summer.<a id="FNanchor_A13-852" href="#Footnote_A13-852" class="fnanchor">A13-852</a></p>

<p>On June 26, Oswald was interviewed by FBI agents in Fort
Worth.<a id="FNanchor_A13-853" href="#Footnote_A13-853" class="fnanchor">A13-853</a> One of the agents who interviewed him described him as
tense and “drawn up”; he said that Oswald “exhibited an arrogant
attitude * * * and [was] inclined to be just a little insolent.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-854" href="#Footnote_A13-854" class="fnanchor">A13-854</a>
Oswald declined to say why he had gone to Russia, saying that he
refused to “relive the past.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-855" href="#Footnote_A13-855" class="fnanchor">A13-855</a> He said that he had not attempted
to obtain Soviet citizenship, had not been approached by Soviet
officials for information about his experiences in the Marines, and had
not offered them such information. Marina’s Soviet passport required
her to notify the Soviet Embassy in Washington of her address in this
country, and Oswald told the agents that he planned to contact the
Embassy for this purpose within a few days.<a id="FNanchor_A13-856" href="#Footnote_A13-856" class="fnanchor">A13-856</a> He promised to notify
the FBI if he were contacted by Soviet agents “under suspicious circumstances
or otherwise.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-857" href="#Footnote_A13-857" class="fnanchor">A13-857</a> Oswald told his brother about the interview,
saying that it had been “just fine.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-858" href="#Footnote_A13-858" class="fnanchor">A13-858</a></p>

<p>Oswald and his family remained with Robert for about a month.<a id="FNanchor_A13-859" href="#Footnote_A13-859" class="fnanchor">A13-859</a>
While they were there his mother moved to Fort Worth from Crowell,
Tex.,<a id="FNanchor_A13-860" href="#Footnote_A13-860" class="fnanchor">A13-860</a> and, sometime in July they moved into her apartment
at 1501 West Seventh Street.<a id="FNanchor_A13-861" href="#Footnote_A13-861" class="fnanchor">A13-861</a> Mrs. Oswald testified that she had
visited them at Robert’s house in June<a id="FNanchor_A13-862" href="#Footnote_A13-862" class="fnanchor">A13-862</a> and moved to Fort Worth
because she thought that the house was too crowded and wanted to
help them.<a id="FNanchor_A13-863" href="#Footnote_A13-863" class="fnanchor">A13-863</a> Mrs. Oswald described the period when her son and his
family lived with her as “a very happy month”; according to her
testimony, she and her son and daughter-in-law got along well. She
mentioned that she not only helped Marina keep house and care for the
baby but also aided her son in his efforts to find employment.<a id="FNanchor_A13-864" href="#Footnote_A13-864" class="fnanchor">A13-864</a>
Marina testified, however, that Lee did not get along well with his
mother and that he decided after several weeks that they should move
to their own apartment.<a id="FNanchor_A13-865" href="#Footnote_A13-865" class="fnanchor">A13-865</a> He did not file a change-of-address card at
the post office when the family moved to West Seventh Street, as he did
when they made their next move,<a id="FNanchor_A13-866" href="#Footnote_A13-866" class="fnanchor">A13-866</a> so he may have contemplated
from the beginning that they would stay with his mother for only
a short while. Around the middle of August,<a id="FNanchor_A13-867" href="#Footnote_A13-867" class="fnanchor">A13-867</a> the Oswalds
moved to a one-bedroom furnished apartment at 2703 Mercedes Street,
for which they paid $59.50 in advance for 1 month’s rent.<a id="FNanchor_A13-868" href="#Footnote_A13-868" class="fnanchor">A13-868</a></p>

<p>In the third week in July, Oswald had obtained a job as a sheet metal
worker with the Louv-R-Pak Division of the Leslie Welding Co.,<a id="FNanchor_A13-869" href="#Footnote_A13-869" class="fnanchor">A13-869</a> a
manufacturer of louvers and ventilators,<a id="FNanchor_A13-870" href="#Footnote_A13-870" class="fnanchor">A13-870</a> to which he had been referred
by the Texas Employment Commission.<a id="FNanchor_A13-871" href="#Footnote_A13-871" class="fnanchor">A13-871</a> On his application
for employment, filled out several days before, he wrote falsely that
he had had experience as a sheet metal worker and machinist in the
Marines and had been honorably discharged.<a id="FNanchor_A13-872" href="#Footnote_A13-872" class="fnanchor">A13-872</a> He usually worked
8 or 9 hours a day, for which he was paid $1.25 an hour.<a id="FNanchor_A13-873" href="#Footnote_A13-873" class="fnanchor">A13-873</a> Marina
testified that Oswald did not like his work,<a id="FNanchor_A13-874" href="#Footnote_A13-874" class="fnanchor">A13-874</a> but he was regarded
as a good employee<a id="FNanchor_A13-875" href="#Footnote_A13-875" class="fnanchor">A13-875</a> and remained with the company until October,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_716">716</span>
when he quit.<a id="FNanchor_A13-876" href="#Footnote_A13-876" class="fnanchor">A13-876</a> On the job, he kept to himself and was considered
uncommunicative.<a id="FNanchor_A13-877" href="#Footnote_A13-877" class="fnanchor">A13-877</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Oswald visited her son and his family at their apartment and
tried to help them get settled; she testified that she bought some clothes
for Marina and a highchair for the baby but that Oswald told her that
he did not want her to buy “things for his wife that he himself could
not buy.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-878" href="#Footnote_A13-878" class="fnanchor">A13-878</a> Finally, Oswald apparently decided that he did not
want his mother to visit the apartment anymore and he became
incensed when his wife permitted her to visit despite his instructions.<a id="FNanchor_A13-879" href="#Footnote_A13-879" class="fnanchor">A13-879</a>
After he moved to Dallas in October, Oswald did not see
his mother or communicate with her in any way until she came to
see him after the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_A13-880" href="#Footnote_A13-880" class="fnanchor">A13-880</a> Witnesses have described the Mercedes
Street apartment as “decrepit” and very poorly furnished;<a id="FNanchor_A13-881" href="#Footnote_A13-881" class="fnanchor">A13-881</a>
there was no telephone service.<a id="FNanchor_A13-882" href="#Footnote_A13-882" class="fnanchor">A13-882</a> Acquaintances observed that Marina
and the baby were poorly clothed, that the Oswalds had little
food, and that at first there was not a bed for the baby.<a id="FNanchor_A13-883" href="#Footnote_A13-883" class="fnanchor">A13-883</a></p>

<p>On August 16, the FBI again interviewed Oswald. This interview
took place in the back seat of a car in front of his home and covered
substantially the same material as the previous interview. Oswald
again denied having made any deal with representatives of the Soviet
Union. He protested his undesirable discharge from the Marines,
and stated that his wife was registered at the Soviet Embassy. He
still refused to discuss why he had gone to the Soviet Union, but he
was less hostile than he had been during the previous interview.<a id="FNanchor_A13-884" href="#Footnote_A13-884" class="fnanchor">A13-884</a>
According to his wife, however, he was very upset by the interest the
FBI showed in him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-885" href="#Footnote_A13-885" class="fnanchor">A13-885</a></p>

<p>The Oswalds became acquainted with a growing number of people of
the Russian-speaking community in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, who
were tied together socially by a common origin, language, and religion.
The group was not restricted to people from Russia but was composed
primarily of people from Eastern European countries.<a id="FNanchor_A13-886" href="#Footnote_A13-886" class="fnanchor">A13-886</a> The
Oswalds’ initial contact with this group was through Peter Gregory.
Marina gave conversational Russian lessons to Paul Gregory 2 days a
week during August and early September, for which she was paid $35.
Most of the lessons took place at the Mercedes Street apartment
and Oswald was generally present.<a id="FNanchor_A13-887" href="#Footnote_A13-887" class="fnanchor">A13-887</a> In addition, Paul Gregory
occasionally took the Oswalds shopping; after they became friendly,
he had a number of discussions with Oswald, some of them politically
oriented.<a id="FNanchor_A13-888" href="#Footnote_A13-888" class="fnanchor">A13-888</a></p>

<p>Sometime around August 25, Peter Gregory invited the Oswalds
and several members of the Russian community to his house for dinner.
One of the guests was George Bouhe, a Dallas accountant and a leader
of the Russian community. He was very interested in meeting and
conversing with Marina, because she had spent much of her life in
Leningrad, which was his birthplace.<a id="FNanchor_A13-889" href="#Footnote_A13-889" class="fnanchor">A13-889</a> Also present was Mrs. Anna
Meller, the Russian-born wife of a Dallas department store employee.<a id="FNanchor_A13-890" href="#Footnote_A13-890" class="fnanchor">A13-890</a>
Near the end of August, the Oswalds met Declan Ford,
a consulting geologist in the Dallas area, and his Russian-born wife
at Mrs. Meller’s home. The Oswalds were also introduced to Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_717">717</span>
Elena Hall, who was born in Tehran, Iran, of Russian parentage.
She worked in a dental laboratory and at this time was divorced from
her former husband John Hall, whom she subsequently remarried. In
order to obtain dental aid for Marina, George Bouhe had brought her
to Mrs. Hall’s house.<a id="FNanchor_A13-891" href="#Footnote_A13-891" class="fnanchor">A13-891</a> In early September, the Oswalds met Alexander
Kleinlerer, another member of the Russian group, who was
then courting Mrs. Hall.<a id="FNanchor_A13-892" href="#Footnote_A13-892" class="fnanchor">A13-892</a> Mrs. Max Clark was introduced to Marina
during this period by George Bouhe and Anna Meller. Max
Clark met the Oswalds at a later time.<a id="FNanchor_A13-893" href="#Footnote_A13-893" class="fnanchor">A13-893</a> At about the same time,
they were visited by George De Mohrenschildt, a petroleum engineer
born in Russia,<a id="FNanchor_A13-894" href="#Footnote_A13-894" class="fnanchor">A13-894</a> who had heard of them from one of the Russian-speaking
group.<a id="FNanchor_A13-895" href="#Footnote_A13-895" class="fnanchor">A13-895</a> Later on, the Oswalds met his wife, Jeanne, and
his daughter and son-in-law, Gary and Alexandra Taylor.<a id="FNanchor_A13-896" href="#Footnote_A13-896" class="fnanchor">A13-896</a></p>

<p>Most of the members of the Russian community were interested in
the Oswalds not only because they needed help, but also because they
could provide the latest information about what was happening in
Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-897" href="#Footnote_A13-897" class="fnanchor">A13-897</a> Some members of the group were at first apprehensive
about them because the apparent ease with which they had left Russia
seemed suspicious.<a id="FNanchor_A13-898" href="#Footnote_A13-898" class="fnanchor">A13-898</a> Nevertheless, many of the group provided small
amounts of money, groceries, clothing, and furniture for the Oswalds;
George Bouhe, Anna Meller, and Elena Hall were the primary contributors,
although others provided help in the form of transportation
and groceries.<a id="FNanchor_A13-899" href="#Footnote_A13-899" class="fnanchor">A13-899</a> These acquaintances occasionally visited the Oswalds,
and the Oswalds in turn visited some of them in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-900" href="#Footnote_A13-900" class="fnanchor">A13-900</a></p>

<p>It was evident that Oswald did not appreciate the help of the
Russian community.<a id="FNanchor_A13-901" href="#Footnote_A13-901" class="fnanchor">A13-901</a> At least once he flew into a rage and shouted
that he did not need any of the things that people were giving to
him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-902" href="#Footnote_A13-902" class="fnanchor">A13-902</a> Some felt that he resented the gifts because he could not give
his wife what the others were providing;<a id="FNanchor_A13-903" href="#Footnote_A13-903" class="fnanchor">A13-903</a> he apparently was critical
of them also because he felt that they were overly concerned with
improving themselves economically.<a id="FNanchor_A13-904" href="#Footnote_A13-904" class="fnanchor">A13-904</a></p>

<p>Oswald became increasingly unpopular with his Russian-speaking
acquaintances, partly because of his resentment of their assistance.<a id="FNanchor_A13-905" href="#Footnote_A13-905" class="fnanchor">A13-905</a>
Alexander Kleinlerer stated that none of them cared for Oswald “because
of his political philosophy, his criticism of the United States,
his apparent lack of interest in anyone but himself and because of his
treatment of Marina.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-906" href="#Footnote_A13-906" class="fnanchor">A13-906</a> Some of them believed that Oswald was
mentally disturbed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-907" href="#Footnote_A13-907" class="fnanchor">A13-907</a> However, they felt sorry for Marina and the
child and continued to help.<a id="FNanchor_A13-908" href="#Footnote_A13-908" class="fnanchor">A13-908</a></p>

<p>On a weekend afternoon early in October, the Oswalds were visited
by his mother and a number of people from the Russian community,
including George Bouhe, Anna Meller, the Halls, the De Mohrenschildts,
and the Taylors.<a id="FNanchor_A13-909" href="#Footnote_A13-909" class="fnanchor">A13-909</a> Oswald had apparently decided to look
for a new job, and discussed his lack of job prospects and the fact that
his rent was overdue.<a id="FNanchor_A13-910" href="#Footnote_A13-910" class="fnanchor">A13-910</a> He was advised to seek employment in the
Dallas area.<a id="FNanchor_A13-911" href="#Footnote_A13-911" class="fnanchor">A13-911</a> Elena Hall invited Marina to move into her house in
Fort Worth until Oswald found a job in Dallas. She accepted the
proposal, and Mrs. Hall moved Marina, her daughter June, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_718">718</span>
Oswalds’ few household goods in a pickup truck belonging to the
dental laboratory where she was employed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-912" href="#Footnote_A13-912" class="fnanchor">A13-912</a></p>

<p>Oswald worked at the Leslie Welding Co. on Monday, October 8,
but failed to appear on the following day. He was already in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-913" href="#Footnote_A13-913" class="fnanchor">A13-913</a>
He falsely told his wife that he had been discharged,<a id="FNanchor_A13-914" href="#Footnote_A13-914" class="fnanchor">A13-914</a> and told
George Bouhe that the job had been a temporary one.<a id="FNanchor_A13-915" href="#Footnote_A13-915" class="fnanchor">A13-915</a> Sometime
later, the company received an undated letter from him stating that
he had “moved permanently to Dallas,” and asking that the wages due
him be forwarded to him at box 2915 in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-916" href="#Footnote_A13-916" class="fnanchor">A13-916</a> He did not tell
his mother that he was leaving Fort Worth.<a id="FNanchor_A13-917" href="#Footnote_A13-917" class="fnanchor">A13-917</a></p>

<p>While they were in Fort Worth, the Oswalds were having marital
problems.<a id="FNanchor_A13-918" href="#Footnote_A13-918" class="fnanchor">A13-918</a> Several people noted that Marina had a blackened eye
when they visited her at the Mercedes Street apartment.<a id="FNanchor_A13-919" href="#Footnote_A13-919" class="fnanchor">A13-919</a> She told
her mother-in-law and George Bouhe that her husband had struck
her, but said to Anna Meller that she had walked into a door.<a id="FNanchor_A13-920" href="#Footnote_A13-920" class="fnanchor">A13-920</a> It
seems clear that Oswald had in fact hit her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-921" href="#Footnote_A13-921" class="fnanchor">A13-921</a> People observed friction
between the Oswalds on various occasions,<a id="FNanchor_A13-922" href="#Footnote_A13-922" class="fnanchor">A13-922</a> although their disputes
became more apparent later. Marina has written that this was a
difficult period for them and that her husband was “very irritable” and
sometimes some completely trivial thing would “drive him into a
rage.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-923" href="#Footnote_A13-923" class="fnanchor">A13-923</a></p>

<p>She testified that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">* * * immediately after coming to the United States Lee
changed. I did not know him as such a man in Russia. * * *
He helped me as before, but he became a little more of a recluse
* * * He was very irritable, sometimes for a trifle * * *<a id="FNanchor_A13-924" href="#Footnote_A13-924" class="fnanchor">A13-924</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">She has denied, however, that their separation was the result of quarrels
between them.<a id="FNanchor_A13-925" href="#Footnote_A13-925" class="fnanchor">A13-925</a></p>

<p>Marina spent the first few weeks after Oswald’s departure at Elena
Hall’s house in Fort Worth, except for a brief stay at Gary Taylor’s
house in Dallas after one of her appointments at the Baylor Dental
Clinic.<a id="FNanchor_A13-926" href="#Footnote_A13-926" class="fnanchor">A13-926</a> While she was in Dallas, Mrs. De Mohrenschildt brought
her to the clinic on October 8, October 10, and October 15;<a id="FNanchor_A13-927" href="#Footnote_A13-927" class="fnanchor">A13-927</a> George
Bouhe had given Mrs. De Mohrenschildt the money to cover the
expense of Marina’s dental care.<a id="FNanchor_A13-928" href="#Footnote_A13-928" class="fnanchor">A13-928</a></p>

<p>Even before Oswald went to Dallas, some of his acquaintances were
helping him in his effort to find a job there.<a id="FNanchor_A13-929" href="#Footnote_A13-929" class="fnanchor">A13-929</a> George De Mohrenschildt
directed him to Samuel B. Ballen, a Dallas financial consultant,
but no employment resulted.<a id="FNanchor_A13-930" href="#Footnote_A13-930" class="fnanchor">A13-930</a> George Bouhe recommended that
Oswald go to the Texas Employment Commission in Dallas; and Anna
Meller had her husband ask Mrs. Helen Cunningham, a counselor in
the clerical and sales division of the Dallas office of the employment
commission, to help Oswald find a job.<a id="FNanchor_A13-931" href="#Footnote_A13-931" class="fnanchor">A13-931</a> Oswald first came
into the office of the employment commission on October 9. He was
reluctant to accept industrial employment, and was placed in the clerical
category and turned over to Mrs. Cunningham for counseling. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_719">719</span>
indicated that he had an interest in writing. The results of general
aptitude tests which he had taken at the Fort Worth employment office
had been transmitted to the Dallas office, and indicated that he had
some aptitude in this direction and for clerical work. It was noted on
his application form that he had “outstanding verbal-clerical potential.”
He demonstrated ability to perform many skilled and semi-skilled
jobs, and there was some indication that he could do college
work. Mrs. Cunningham gave him three special tests: for general
clerical work, work as an insurance claims examiner, and drafting
work. He scored high on all three. His application form indicated
that he did not have a driver’s license, and noted: “well-groomed and
spoken, business suit, alert replies—expresses self extremely well.” He
told Mrs. Cunningham that he hoped to develop qualifications for responsible
junior executive employment by a work-study program at a
local college but that this must be delayed because of his immediate
financial needs and responsibilities.<a id="FNanchor_A13-932" href="#Footnote_A13-932" class="fnanchor">A13-932</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Cunningham concluded that although Oswald would be classified
for clerical work, she should try to get him any available job,
since he badly needed money. He was referred to an architect for
an opening as a messenger but was not hired. On October 11, he
was referred to Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall Co., a graphic arts company,
in response to a call from John Graef, head of the photographic department
of the company, who had told the employment commission
that he needed a photoprint trainee. Oswald was enthusiastic about
his prospects and apparently made a good impression; Graef picked
him over several other applicants.<a id="FNanchor_A13-933" href="#Footnote_A13-933" class="fnanchor">A13-933</a> On the following day he began
working in his new position as a trainee making prints of advertising
material. He worked a 40-hour week at approximately $1.35
per hour; his take-home pay varied from $49 to $74 a week.<a id="FNanchor_A13-934" href="#Footnote_A13-934" class="fnanchor">A13-934</a> According
to his wife, “he liked his work very much.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-935" href="#Footnote_A13-935" class="fnanchor">A13-935</a></p>

<p>Oswald moved into the YMCA on October 15, and stayed there
until October 19, paying $2.25 a night.<a id="FNanchor_A13-936" href="#Footnote_A13-936" class="fnanchor">A13-936</a> He had used the Taylors’
address and telephone number as a place where he could be reached,<a id="FNanchor_A13-937" href="#Footnote_A13-937" class="fnanchor">A13-937</a>
but on October 9 had also rented post office box 2915 under his own
name at the main post office on Ervay Street.<a id="FNanchor_A13-938" href="#Footnote_A13-938" class="fnanchor">A13-938</a> On October 10, he
filed a change-of-address form indicating that mail for 2703 Mercedes
Street should be forwarded to the box.<a id="FNanchor_A13-939" href="#Footnote_A13-939" class="fnanchor">A13-939</a> Marina has written that
Oswald wrote her letters and telephoned her during the separation.<a id="FNanchor_A13-940" href="#Footnote_A13-940" class="fnanchor">A13-940</a></p>

<p>On October 16, Mrs Hall brought Marina and June to Dallas to
have June baptized. Marina apparently did this surreptitiously, because
her husband opposed baptism; they did not contact him in Dallas,
but left birthday gifts for him at the Taylors. Oswald did not
appear very disturbed when he found out about the baptism.<a id="FNanchor_A13-941" href="#Footnote_A13-941" class="fnanchor">A13-941</a></p>

<p>Two days later, Mrs. Hall had an automobile accident and went to
the hospital, where she remained until October 26; Marina remained
in the Hall house. Mrs. Max Clark and Alexander Kleinlerer, a
friend of Mrs. Hall, checked up to make sure that she was getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_720">720</span>
along without too much trouble.<a id="FNanchor_A13-942" href="#Footnote_A13-942" class="fnanchor">A13-942</a> After Oswald left the YMCA on
October 19, he moved to a room or apartment somewhere in Dallas,<a id="FNanchor_A13-943" href="#Footnote_A13-943" class="fnanchor">A13-943</a>
which has not been located.<a id="FNanchor_A13-944" href="#Footnote_A13-944" class="fnanchor">A13-944</a> It seems likely, however, that during
that time he spent several weekends with Marina at the Hall house.<a id="FNanchor_A13-945" href="#Footnote_A13-945" class="fnanchor">A13-945</a></p>

<p>Four days after Mrs. Hall returned from the hospital, she left for
New York to visit friends. By the time she returned, Marina had
moved to a three-room apartment at 604 Elsbeth Street in Dallas,
which Oswald had rented on Saturday, November 3;<a id="FNanchor_A13-946" href="#Footnote_A13-946" class="fnanchor">A13-946</a> the landlady
stated that he had looked at the apartment about a week before. The
monthly rent was $68, in addition to which he had to pay several dollars
a month for utilities. He paid the rent plus a $5 deposit on November
3,<a id="FNanchor_A13-947" href="#Footnote_A13-947" class="fnanchor">A13-947</a> but probably spent that night with Marina at the Hall house.
On Sunday the Taylors helped the Oswalds move their belongings
to the Elsbeth Street apartment with a rented trailer.<a id="FNanchor_A13-948" href="#Footnote_A13-948" class="fnanchor">A13-948</a> Oswald
had asked Kleinlerer to help them move, and Kleinlerer also was present
when they departed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-949" href="#Footnote_A13-949" class="fnanchor">A13-949</a></p>

<p>Soon after the Oswalds were reunited, their marital difficulties
started again. While they were moving to Elsbeth Street, Kleinlerer
noticed that Oswald slapped his wife for not having the zipper on her
dress completely closed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-950" href="#Footnote_A13-950" class="fnanchor">A13-950</a> They argued over his refusal to allow
her to smoke.<a id="FNanchor_A13-951" href="#Footnote_A13-951" class="fnanchor">A13-951</a> There was a quarrel also when he told the landlady
that Marina was from Czechoslovakia; he was angered when Marina,
who disapproved of this deception, told the landlady the truth.<a id="FNanchor_A13-952" href="#Footnote_A13-952" class="fnanchor">A13-952</a></p>

<p>Although several people tried to help Marina improve her scanty
knowledge of English, Oswald discouraged this,<a id="FNanchor_A13-953" href="#Footnote_A13-953" class="fnanchor">A13-953</a> perhaps because
he wanted to keep up his Russian.<a id="FNanchor_A13-954" href="#Footnote_A13-954" class="fnanchor">A13-954</a> Some witnesses testified that
she commented about his sexual abilities.<a id="FNanchor_A13-955" href="#Footnote_A13-955" class="fnanchor">A13-955</a> He apparently continued
to beat her, and once she suggested to George De Mohrenschildt
that she should “get away” from Oswald. When De
Mohrenschildt criticized Oswald’s conduct, Oswald replied, “It is
my business.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-956" href="#Footnote_A13-956" class="fnanchor">A13-956</a> Marina testified that when they moved into
the Elsbeth Street apartment, her husband became “nervous and
irritable” and was very angry over “trifles.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-957" href="#Footnote_A13-957" class="fnanchor">A13-957</a> She said that it was
sometimes her fault that he beat her,<a id="FNanchor_A13-958" href="#Footnote_A13-958" class="fnanchor">A13-958</a> for example when she wrote
to an old boyfriend in Russia that she wished she had married him;
the letter was returned for postage due, and Oswald read it.<a id="FNanchor_A13-959" href="#Footnote_A13-959" class="fnanchor">A13-959</a></p>

<p>Because of this quarreling, a few of their acquaintances felt that
Marina would be better off alone. George Bouhe offered to help her
if she promised to leave Oswald permanently.<a id="FNanchor_A13-960" href="#Footnote_A13-960" class="fnanchor">A13-960</a> Finally, in early
November, Marina, helped by the De Mohrenschildts, moved into
Anna Meller’s house with the intention not to return to Oswald. He
was apparently quite upset and did not want Marina to leave him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-961" href="#Footnote_A13-961" class="fnanchor">A13-961</a></p>

<p>Oswald did not visit his wife at Anna Meller’s house,<a id="FNanchor_A13-962" href="#Footnote_A13-962" class="fnanchor">A13-962</a> and for a
short time did not even know where she was.<a id="FNanchor_A13-963" href="#Footnote_A13-963" class="fnanchor">A13-963</a> According to Marina,
he called her after she moved and they met at De Mohrenschildt’s
house. He asked her to return home. She insisted that he stop
quarreling and that he change his ways. He said that he could not
change. Marina would not agree to return home with him and he
left.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_721">721</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-964" href="#Footnote_A13-964" class="fnanchor">A13-964</a></p>

<p>Marina was uncomfortable at the Meller house, where there was
very little room. She moved to Katherine Ford’s house<a id="FNanchor_A13-965" href="#Footnote_A13-965" class="fnanchor">A13-965</a> where she
apparently stayed from November 11 to 17. She indicated that she
had decided never to return to her husband;<a id="FNanchor_A13-966" href="#Footnote_A13-966" class="fnanchor">A13-966</a> it was Mrs. Ford’s
impression that Marina was going to stay at other people’s houses until
a permanent place could be found for her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-967" href="#Footnote_A13-967" class="fnanchor">A13-967</a> When Mr. Ford returned
from a business trip on November 17, Marina and June moved
to the home of Mrs. Frank Ray, where they spent the day. Mrs. Ray,
the wife of a Dallas advertising man, was also of Russian origin. Since
Mrs. Ray had no baby bed, Marina returned to the Fords that evening.
On the next day, however, Marina moved her belongings to the Rays’
house. That same day, Oswald called and asked to visit his wife,
whom he had called and written. Mr. Ray picked him up and took
him to Marina.<a id="FNanchor_A13-968" href="#Footnote_A13-968" class="fnanchor">A13-968</a></p>

<p>Marina testified that at this meeting Oswald professed his love for
her. She stated: “I saw him cry * * * [he] begged me to come back,
asked my forgiveness, and promised that he would try to improve,
if only I would come back.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-969" href="#Footnote_A13-969" class="fnanchor">A13-969</a> On another occasion she said: “* * *
he cried and you know a woman’s heart—I went back to him. He
said he didn’t care to live if I did not return.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-970" href="#Footnote_A13-970" class="fnanchor">A13-970</a> That same day she
decided to return to him. Mr. Ray packed her belongings and took
her back to the Elsbeth Street apartment.<a id="FNanchor_A13-971" href="#Footnote_A13-971" class="fnanchor">A13-971</a></p>

<p>Members of the Russian community who had taken care of Marina
so that she would not have to live with Oswald felt that their efforts
had been in vain. George Bouhe was so irritated that he never again
tried to help either of the Oswalds.<a id="FNanchor_A13-972" href="#Footnote_A13-972" class="fnanchor">A13-972</a> Contacts between them and
members of the Russian community diminished markedly.<a id="FNanchor_A13-973" href="#Footnote_A13-973" class="fnanchor">A13-973</a> Oswald
did not care for most of these people and made his feelings apparent.<a id="FNanchor_A13-974" href="#Footnote_A13-974" class="fnanchor">A13-974</a>
Even the De Mohrenschildts, whom he liked most, saw much less of
them.<a id="FNanchor_A13-975" href="#Footnote_A13-975" class="fnanchor">A13-975</a> Lydia Dymitruk, another Russian born woman in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area, testified that she saw the Oswalds on only one occasion,
and did not care to see them again. She drove Marina and
June, who had a high fever, to the hospital; Oswald told the hospital
that he was unemployed in order to avoid paying for June’s treatment
and later left Mrs. Dymitruk without thanking her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-976" href="#Footnote_A13-976" class="fnanchor">A13-976</a> Mrs. Ford
testified that Marina had told her that she contemplated suicide during
this period because Oswald was treating her badly and she had no
friends; she felt that she had “no way out.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-977" href="#Footnote_A13-977" class="fnanchor">A13-977</a> Marina acknowledged
to the Commission that she had had such thoughts.<a id="FNanchor_A13-978" href="#Footnote_A13-978" class="fnanchor">A13-978</a></p>

<p>In an effort to renew family ties, Robert Oswald wrote to Lee and
John Pic on November 17, inviting them and their families to Thanksgiving
dinner. Lee accepted the invitation. He and Marina traveled
to Fort Worth by bus on Thanksgiving Day, and John Pic and
Robert met them at the station.<a id="FNanchor_A13-979" href="#Footnote_A13-979" class="fnanchor">A13-979</a> Pic had not seen his half-brother
for 10 years. He observed, as many others have also attested, that
Lee seemed to be a good father and to take an active interest in June.<a id="FNanchor_A13-980" href="#Footnote_A13-980" class="fnanchor">A13-980</a>
After dinner, Marina phoned Paul Gregory, who later drove the Oswalds
to his house for sandwiches and then took them to the bus station
for the return trip to Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-981" href="#Footnote_A13-981" class="fnanchor">A13-981</a> Thereafter, Robert spoke to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_722">722</span>
brother once by telephone and received a post card and a letter from
him, but he eventually lost contact with Lee and did not see him again
until after the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_A13-982" href="#Footnote_A13-982" class="fnanchor">A13-982</a></p>

<p>Despite his disillusionment with Soviet life, Oswald kept up his
interest in Russia. He wrote to the Soviet Embassy in Washington
for information on how to subscribe to Russian periodicals and for
“any periodicals or bulletins which you may put out for the benefit
of your citizens living, for a time, in the U.S.A.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-983" href="#Footnote_A13-983" class="fnanchor">A13-983</a> He subsequently
subscribed to several Russian journals.<a id="FNanchor_A13-984" href="#Footnote_A13-984" class="fnanchor">A13-984</a> In December 1962, the Soviet
Embassy received a card in Russian, signed “Marina and Lee
Oswald,” which conveyed New Year’s greetings and wishes for
“health, success and all of the best” to the employees at the Embassy.<a id="FNanchor_A13-985" href="#Footnote_A13-985" class="fnanchor">A13-985</a>
The Oswalds continued to correspond with acquaintances in Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-986" href="#Footnote_A13-986" class="fnanchor">A13-986</a></p>

<p>Soon after his return to this country, Oswald had started to correspond
with the Communist Party, U.S.A., and the Socialist Workers
Party. He subscribed to the Worker in August 1962.<a id="FNanchor_A13-987" href="#Footnote_A13-987" class="fnanchor">A13-987</a> He wrote
for additional literature from these organizations, and attempted to
join the Socialist Workers Party, which, however, had no branch in
Texas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-988" href="#Footnote_A13-988" class="fnanchor">A13-988</a> He sent samples of his photographic work to the Socialist
Workers Party, the Worker, and the Hall-Davis Defense Committee,
and offered to aid them in printing and photographic work in connection
with posters; these offers were not accepted.<a id="FNanchor_A13-989" href="#Footnote_A13-989" class="fnanchor">A13-989</a></p>

<p>He continued to read a great deal on a variety of subjects.<a id="FNanchor_A13-990" href="#Footnote_A13-990" class="fnanchor">A13-990</a> George
Bouhe testified that Oswald’s fare consisted of books by Marx, Lenin,
“and similar things.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-991" href="#Footnote_A13-991" class="fnanchor">A13-991</a> Marina said that he read books of a historical
nature, including H. G. Wells’ two volume “Outline of History,” and
biographies of Hitler, Kennedy, and Khrushchev.<a id="FNanchor_A13-992" href="#Footnote_A13-992" class="fnanchor">A13-992</a></p>

<p>Despite the Oswalds’ break with the Russian community, De Mohrenschildt,
knowing that they would be alone during the Christmas season,
asked the Fords whether he could bring the Oswalds to a party
celebrating the Russian Christmas at the Fords’ home; the Fords
assented. The party was attended by many members of the Russian
community.<a id="FNanchor_A13-993" href="#Footnote_A13-993" class="fnanchor">A13-993</a> Oswald spoke at length with Yaeko Okui, a Japanese
woman who had been brought to the party by Lev Aronson, first cellist
of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra;<a id="FNanchor_A13-994" href="#Footnote_A13-994" class="fnanchor">A13-994</a> she told Federal investigators
that she never saw Oswald again.<a id="FNanchor_A13-995" href="#Footnote_A13-995" class="fnanchor">A13-995</a> The Oswalds were not invited
to three other Russian Christmas season gatherings which occurred
during the next few days.<a id="FNanchor_A13-996" href="#Footnote_A13-996" class="fnanchor">A13-996</a></p>

<p>Marina visited the De Mohrenschildts several times after Christmas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-997" href="#Footnote_A13-997" class="fnanchor">A13-997</a>
They invited both Lee and Marina to a small dinner party in
February 1963; also present were Everett Glover, a chemist employed
in Dallas, and his roommate Volkmar Schmidt.<a id="FNanchor_A13-998" href="#Footnote_A13-998" class="fnanchor">A13-998</a> On February 22,
Glover had a gathering at his house, one of the purposes of which
was to permit his friends, many of whom were studying Russian, to
meet the Oswalds.<a id="FNanchor_A13-999" href="#Footnote_A13-999" class="fnanchor">A13-999</a> They were the objects of much attention.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1000" href="#Footnote_A13-1000" class="fnanchor">A13-1000</a>
Marina conversed at length with another guest named Ruth Paine,
who had recently separated from her husband, Michael Paine, a research
engineer at the Bell Helicopter plant in Fort Worth. Mrs.
Paine, who was studying Russian, obtained Marina’s address<a id="FNanchor_A13-1001" href="#Footnote_A13-1001" class="fnanchor">A13-1001</a> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_723">723</span>
shortly thereafter wrote Marina asking to see her. Marina responded
by inviting Mrs. Paine to visit her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1002" href="#Footnote_A13-1002" class="fnanchor">A13-1002</a></p>

<p>The Oswalds moved out of their Elsbeth Street apartment on March
3, 1963, to an upstairs apartment several blocks away at 214 West
Neely Street. Oswald inquired about the apartment in response to
a “For Rent” sign; the rent was $60 per month, not including utilities,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1003" href="#Footnote_A13-1003" class="fnanchor">A13-1003</a>
They moved without assistance, carrying their belongings in
their hands and in a baby stroller.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1004" href="#Footnote_A13-1004" class="fnanchor">A13-1004</a> Marina preferred the Neely
Street apartment because it had a porch and was, she felt, more suitable
for June.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1005" href="#Footnote_A13-1005" class="fnanchor">A13-1005</a></p>

<p>Aware of Oswald’s difficulties in obtaining employment, George
Bouhe had advised him as early as October 1962 to attend a night
school in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1006" href="#Footnote_A13-1006" class="fnanchor">A13-1006</a> On January 14, Oswald enrolled in a typing
course in the night school of Crozier Technical High School, and
started attending on January 28. The class ran from 6:15 to 7:15
p.m. on Mondays, Tuesday, and Thursdays. Although Oswald reviewed
a typing textbook at home, he attended the course irregularly
and stopped going altogether on about March 28.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1007" href="#Footnote_A13-1007" class="fnanchor">A13-1007</a></p>

<p>Ruth Paine and Marina started to exchange visits in March. Mrs.
Paine invited the Oswalds for dinner, and on April 20 she took
them on a picnic. When Oswald was not present, the two women
frequently discussed their respective marital problems, and Marina
disclosed to Mrs. Paine that she was pregnant.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1008" href="#Footnote_A13-1008" class="fnanchor">A13-1008</a> Marina wrote of
these meetings:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One day we were invited to a friend’s house, where I met Ruth
Paine, who was studying Russian here in America and wanted to
improve her conversational knowledge. We began to see each
other. Ruth would come to see me with her children. This was
very good for both me and for June. She was growing up alone
and becoming terribly wild, so the company of other children
was good for her. Sometimes we went out on picnics at a nearby
lake. Lee loved to fish, and we would look and rejoice if he
caught a little fish. Several times we went to visit Ruth who
lived in Irving.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1009" href="#Footnote_A13-1009" class="fnanchor">A13-1009</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Using the name of A. J. Hidell, Oswald had ordered a Smith &amp;
Wesson .38 revolver from Los Angeles on a form which he dated
January 27. On March 12, he ordered a rifle from Klein’s Sporting
Goods in Chicago under the name of A. Hidell.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1010" href="#Footnote_A13-1010" class="fnanchor">A13-1010</a> Oswald used the
name “Alek James Hidell” on identification cards which he probably
produced at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall. One of his fellow employees
taught him various photographic techniques, which he could have used
to prepare not only these cards, but also the samples of his work which
he sent to various organizations.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1011" href="#Footnote_A13-1011" class="fnanchor">A13-1011</a></p>

<p>Both weapons were shipped on March 20.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1012" href="#Footnote_A13-1012" class="fnanchor">A13-1012</a> Oswald kept the rifle
in a small storeroom at the Neely Street apartment. He spent long
periods of time in the storeroom, which he told Marina she was not
to enter.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1013" href="#Footnote_A13-1013" class="fnanchor">A13-1013</a> He told her that he intended to use the rifle for hunting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_724">724</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-1014" href="#Footnote_A13-1014" class="fnanchor">A13-1014</a>
and that he practiced with it. She saw him leave with it
once, and clean it several times.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1015" href="#Footnote_A13-1015" class="fnanchor">A13-1015</a> He also posed for two pictures,
taken by Marina in the backyard of the Neely apartment, in which
he held his rifle and copies of the Worker and the Militant and the
revolver was strapped to his belt. He gave one of the pictures to his
wife and asked her to keep it for June.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1016" href="#Footnote_A13-1016" class="fnanchor">A13-1016</a></p>

<p>Over the weekend of March 9-10, Oswald photographed the alley
which runs behind the home of Gen. Edwin Walker, and probably at
about the same time he photographed the rear of Walker’s home and
a nearby railroad track and right-of-way.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1017" href="#Footnote_A13-1017" class="fnanchor">A13-1017</a> He prepared and studied
a notebook in which he outlined a plan to shoot General Walker, and he
looked at bus schedules.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1018" href="#Footnote_A13-1018" class="fnanchor">A13-1018</a> He went to the Walker residence on the
evening of April 6 or 7, planning to make his attack. However, he
changed his plans, hid his rifle nearby, and determined to act on the
following Wednesday, April 10, when a nearby church was planning
a meeting which, Oswald reasoned, would create a diversion that
would help him escape.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1019" href="#Footnote_A13-1019" class="fnanchor">A13-1019</a> On Wednesday, Oswald left a note for
Marina telling her what to do if he were apprehended. He retrieved
his rifle and fired at Walker, but the bullet narrowly missed Walker’s
head. Oswald secreted his rifle again and took the bus home.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1020" href="#Footnote_A13-1020" class="fnanchor">A13-1020</a></p>

<p>When Oswald told Marina what he had done, she became angry
and made him promise never to repeat such an act. She testified that
she kept his letter, intending to give it to the authorities if he
repeated his attempt. He told Marina that he was sorry he had
missed Walker and said that the shooting of Walker would have been
analogous to an assassination of Hitler.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1021" href="#Footnote_A13-1021" class="fnanchor">A13-1021</a> Several days later, the
De Mohrenschildts visited the Oswalds, bringing an Easter present
for June. During the visit, Jeanne De Mohrenschildt saw the rifle
and told her husband about it. Without any knowledge of the truth,
De Mohrenschildt jokingly intimated that Oswald was the one who had
shot at Walker. Oswald apparently concluded that Marina had told
De Mohrenschildt of his role in the attempt and was visibly shaken.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1022" href="#Footnote_A13-1022" class="fnanchor">A13-1022</a></p>

<p>On April 6, Oswald was dropped by Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall because,
in his supervisor’s opinion, he could not do the work, although he
was trying; in addition, he did not get along with his fellow employees.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1023" href="#Footnote_A13-1023" class="fnanchor">A13-1023</a>
The fact that he brought a Russian newspaper to work
may also have been of some significance.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1024" href="#Footnote_A13-1024" class="fnanchor">A13-1024</a> Marina testified that
her husband, who had always worried about his job security at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1025" href="#Footnote_A13-1025" class="fnanchor">A13-1025</a>
was quite upset by the loss of his job since he had
liked the work.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1026" href="#Footnote_A13-1026" class="fnanchor">A13-1026</a></p>

<p>Oswald again resorted to the Texas Employment Commission.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1027" href="#Footnote_A13-1027" class="fnanchor">A13-1027</a>
On April 8, he informed the Commission that he was seeking employment
but was referred to no employers. He stated that he had been
laid off at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall due to lack of work.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1028" href="#Footnote_A13-1028" class="fnanchor">A13-1028</a> On April
12, he made a claim for unemployment benefits; 4 days later the
commission mailed him a determination disapproving his claim because
of insufficient wage credits.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1029" href="#Footnote_A13-1029" class="fnanchor">A13-1029</a></p>

<p>For a while after the Oswalds moved into the Neely Street apartment
they got along well,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1030" href="#Footnote_A13-1030" class="fnanchor">A13-1030</a> but they soon began to quarrel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_725">725</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-1031" href="#Footnote_A13-1031" class="fnanchor">A13-1031</a>
Oswald was apparently still preventing Marina from learning English,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1032" href="#Footnote_A13-1032" class="fnanchor">A13-1032</a>
and there is some indication that he continued to beat her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1033" href="#Footnote_A13-1033" class="fnanchor">A13-1033</a>
Since February, he had been urging her to return to Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1034" href="#Footnote_A13-1034" class="fnanchor">A13-1034</a>
Marina wrote several letters to the Russian Embassy requesting a
visa to return to Russia;<a id="FNanchor_A13-1035" href="#Footnote_A13-1035" class="fnanchor">A13-1035</a> she testified, however, that Oswald forced
her to write them, and that she never wanted to return to Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1036" href="#Footnote_A13-1036" class="fnanchor">A13-1036</a></p>

<p>When Ruth Paine visited the Oswalds at their apartment on
April 24, she was surprised to learn that Oswald was packed and
ready to leave for New Orleans by bus. He explained that he had
been unable to find employment in or around Dallas, and that Marina
had suggested that he go to New Orleans since he had been born
there.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1037" href="#Footnote_A13-1037" class="fnanchor">A13-1037</a> Marina has testified that the real reason behind her suggestion
was that she wanted to get him out of town because of the
Walker incident.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1038" href="#Footnote_A13-1038" class="fnanchor">A13-1038</a> Mrs. Paine offered to drive Marina to New
Orleans at a later date, and also to have Marina and June stay with
her rather than at the apartment in the meantime. Oswald helped
the women pack Mrs. Paine’s car, and the two women moved everything
from the Neely Street apartment to the Paine house in Irving.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1039" href="#Footnote_A13-1039" class="fnanchor">A13-1039</a></p>

<p>When he arrived at the bus station in New Orleans, Oswald telephoned
his aunt, Lillian Murret, to ask if he could stay at her home
at 757 French Street while he looked for employment. She had
been unaware that he had returned from Russia or that he was
married and had a child and was surprised to hear from him. She
said that she did not have room to accommodate three guests, but that
since he was alone he was welcome.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1040" href="#Footnote_A13-1040" class="fnanchor">A13-1040</a></p>

<p>Oswald had been born in New Orleans, and on his return showed
great interest in finding out what had happened to the other members
of his father’s family. He visited the cemetery where his father
was buried and called all the Oswalds in the telephone book. By this
method he located one relative, Mrs. Hazel Oswald of Metairie, La.,
the widow of William Stout Oswald, his father’s brother. He visited
her at her home; she gave him a picture of his father and told him that
as far as she knew the rest of the family was dead.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1041" href="#Footnote_A13-1041" class="fnanchor">A13-1041</a></p>

<p>On April 26, Oswald began his search for employment. He went
to the employment office of the Louisiana Department of Labor and
stated that he was qualified as a commercial photographer, shipping
clerk, or “darkroom man.” The interviewer noted on Oswald’s application
card: “Will travel on limited basis. Will relocate. Min. $1.25
hr. Neat. Suit. Tie. Polite.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-1042" href="#Footnote_A13-1042" class="fnanchor">A13-1042</a> Although the employment commission
made a few referrals, Oswald relied primarily upon newspaper
advertisements, and applied for a number of positions.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1043" href="#Footnote_A13-1043" class="fnanchor">A13-1043</a> Mrs. Murret
testified that he would spend the day job hunting, return to her
home for supper, watch television, and go to bed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1044" href="#Footnote_A13-1044" class="fnanchor">A13-1044</a></p>

<p>On April 29, he filed a request for reconsideration of the employment
commission’s disapproval of his unemployment compensation
claim. His complaint that he had not been credited for his employment
at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall was ruled valid on May 8, and he
was granted maximum benefits of $369, payable at the rate of $33
per week. He filed interstate claims on May 7 and 15, and received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_726">726</span>
$33 in response to the latter; the former claim was filed before the
expiration of the prescribed waiting period.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1045" href="#Footnote_A13-1045" class="fnanchor">A13-1045</a> Not only had Oswald
in fact been working since May 10, but he included on his claim
sheet, as concerns with which he had sought work, fictitious employers
and employers whom he apparently had not contacted.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1046" href="#Footnote_A13-1046" class="fnanchor">A13-1046</a></p>

<p>Oswald wrote to Marina: “All is well. I am living with Aunt
Lillian. She has very kindly taken us in. I am now looking for
work. When I find it I will write you.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-1047" href="#Footnote_A13-1047" class="fnanchor">A13-1047</a> And on May 3, he wrote
to Marina and Ruth Paine: “Girls, I still have not found work, but I
receive money from the unemployment office in the amount 15 to 20
dollars. They were mistaken in the Dallas office when they refused,
but I straightened everything out. Uncle ‘Dyuz’ offered me a loan
of $200.00 if needed. Great, eh?!”<a id="FNanchor_A13-1048" href="#Footnote_A13-1048" class="fnanchor">A13-1048</a></p>

<p>On May 9, responding to a newspaper advertisement, Oswald completed
an application for employment with William B. Reily Co.,
Inc., at 640 Magazine Street, an enterprise engaged in the roasting,
grinding, canning, bagging, and sale of coffee. On his application
form, Oswald listed as references in addition to John Murret, “Sgt.
Robert Hidell” and “Lieut. J. Evans,” both apparently fictitious
names.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1049" href="#Footnote_A13-1049" class="fnanchor">A13-1049</a> His application was approved and he began work on May
10, at the rate of $1.50 per hour. His task was the lubrication of the
company’s machinery.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1050" href="#Footnote_A13-1050" class="fnanchor">A13-1050</a> Oswald did not enjoy this work,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1051" href="#Footnote_A13-1051" class="fnanchor">A13-1051</a> and told
his wife and Mrs. Paine that he was working in commercial photography.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1052" href="#Footnote_A13-1052" class="fnanchor">A13-1052</a></p>

<p>Also on May 9, Oswald obtained an apartment at 4905 Magazine
Street with the help of Myrtle Evans, who had known him when he
was a child. The rent was $65 a month. Oswald moved in on May
10,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1053" href="#Footnote_A13-1053" class="fnanchor">A13-1053</a> after telephoning Marina on the ninth and asking her to come
to New Orleans. Ruth Paine testified that the invitation elated Marina:
“Papa nas lubet”—“Daddy loves us,” she repeated again and
again. Mrs. Paine drove Marina and June to New Orleans; they left
Dallas on May 10, spent the night in Shreveport, and arrived on the
11th. Mrs. Paine stayed with the Oswalds for 3 days; the three of
them, with June and Mrs. Paine’s children, toured the French Quarter.
On May 14, Mrs. Paine left New Orleans to return to her home.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1054" href="#Footnote_A13-1054" class="fnanchor">A13-1054</a></p>

<p>The Murrets and the Oswalds exchanged visits from time to time;
Marina testified that the Murrets were very good to them.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1055" href="#Footnote_A13-1055" class="fnanchor">A13-1055</a> Mrs.
Murret’s daughter, Marilyn, took the Oswalds on an outing.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1056" href="#Footnote_A13-1056" class="fnanchor">A13-1056</a> But,
according to Marina’s testimony, aside from Ruth Paine and Ruth
Kloepfer and her daughters, the Murrets were the only social visitors
the Oswalds had.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1057" href="#Footnote_A13-1057" class="fnanchor">A13-1057</a> Ruth Kloepfer was a clerk of the Quaker Meeting
in New Orleans whom Ruth Paine had written in the hope that she
might know some Russian-speaking people who could visit Marina.
Mrs. Kloepfer herself visited the Oswalds but made no attempt to
direct any Russian-speaking people to them.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1058" href="#Footnote_A13-1058" class="fnanchor">A13-1058</a></p>

<p>On July 19, Oswald was dismissed by Reily because of inefficiency
and inattention to his work. He had spent many of his working hours
next door at the Crescent City Garage, where he read gun magazines
and discussed guns with one of the owners, Adrian Alba.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1059" href="#Footnote_A13-1059" class="fnanchor">A13-1059</a> On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_727">727</span>
following Monday, July 22, Oswald again visited the Louisiana employment
office to seek new employment and file a claim for unemployment
compensation. Thereafter, he collected unemployment
compensation weekly and, although apparently making some effort
to obtain another job, again listed a number of fictitious job applications
on his unemployment compensation claim forms.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1060" href="#Footnote_A13-1060" class="fnanchor">A13-1060</a> He soon
gave up his search for employment, and began to spend his days at
home reading.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1061" href="#Footnote_A13-1061" class="fnanchor">A13-1061</a> He received another setback on July 25, when
he was notified that in response to the request for review which he
had made in 1962, his undesirable discharge from the Marine Corps
had been affirmed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1062" href="#Footnote_A13-1062" class="fnanchor">A13-1062</a></p>

<p>During this period, Oswald began to evidence thoughts of returning
to the Soviet Union or going to Cuba. On June 24 he applied for
a new passport, which he received on the following day.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1063" href="#Footnote_A13-1063" class="fnanchor">A13-1063</a> Apparently
at Oswald’s request,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1064" href="#Footnote_A13-1064" class="fnanchor">A13-1064</a> Marina wrote to the Russian Embassy,
expressing a desire to return to Russia and indicating that she would
be accompanied by her husband. She explained that she wanted to
return because of family problems, including the impending birth
of her second child.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1065" href="#Footnote_A13-1065" class="fnanchor">A13-1065</a> Accompanying her letter was a letter written
by Oswald dated July 1, in which he asked the Embassy to rush an
entrance visa for his wife and requested that his visa be considered
separately.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1066" href="#Footnote_A13-1066" class="fnanchor">A13-1066</a> Marina believed that Oswald was really planning to
go only to Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1067" href="#Footnote_A13-1067" class="fnanchor">A13-1067</a> She testified that “his basic desire was to get to
Cuba by any means, and that all the rest of it was window dressing for
that purpose.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-1068" href="#Footnote_A13-1068" class="fnanchor">A13-1068</a></p>

<p>During the early days of the New Orleans period, the Oswalds’
marriage was more harmonious than it had been previously. Marina
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">* * * our family life in New Orleans was more peaceful. Lee
took great satisfaction in showing me the city where he was born.
We often went to the beach, the zoo, and the park. Lee liked
to go and hunt crabs. It is true, that he was not very pleased with
his job * * * We did not have very much money, and the birth
of a new child involved new expenses * * * As before, Lee spent
a great deal of time reading.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1069" href="#Footnote_A13-1069" class="fnanchor">A13-1069</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Marina testified, however, that after they had been in New Orleans
for a while, Oswald became depressed and that she once found him
alone in the dark crying.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1070" href="#Footnote_A13-1070" class="fnanchor">A13-1070</a> She wrote to Ruth Paine that his “love”
had ceased soon after Mrs. Paine had left New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1071" href="#Footnote_A13-1071" class="fnanchor">A13-1071</a> Mrs.
Paine testified, however, that she had noticed friction between the
Oswalds before she left.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1072" href="#Footnote_A13-1072" class="fnanchor">A13-1072</a> On July 11, Mrs. Paine wrote Marina
that if Oswald did not wish to live with her any more and preferred
that she return to the Soviet Union, she could live at the Paines’ house.
Although Mrs. Paine had long entertained this idea, this was the first
time she explicitly made the invitation. She renewed the invitation on
July 12, and again on July 14; she attempted to overcome any feeling
which Marina might have that she would be a burden by stating that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_728">728</span>
Marina could help with the housework and help her learn Russian, and
that she would also provide a tax advantage.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1073" href="#Footnote_A13-1073" class="fnanchor">A13-1073</a></p>

<p>Marina replied that she had previously raised the subject of a separation
and that it had led to arguments. She stated that she was
happy and that for a considerable period of time Oswald had been
good to her. She attributed this improved attitude to the fact that
he was anticipating their second child. Marina turned down Mrs.
Paine’s invitation but said that she would take advantage of it if
things became worse.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1074" href="#Footnote_A13-1074" class="fnanchor">A13-1074</a> Mrs. Paine replied that she was taking a
trip north to visit her parents and would visit Marina in New Orleans
about September 18. She also suggested that Marina come to her
house for the birth of the baby.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1075" href="#Footnote_A13-1075" class="fnanchor">A13-1075</a></p>

<p>On July 6, Eugene Murret, a cousin of Oswald who was studying to
be a Jesuit Priest in Mobile, Ala., wrote and asked if Oswald could
come to Mobile and speak at the Jesuit House of Studies about “contemporary
Russia and the practice of Communism there.” Oswald
accepted, and on July 27 he and his family, joined by some of the Murrets,
traveled to Mobile; Charles Murret paid the expenses. Oswald
spoke concerning his observations in Russia and conducted a question
and answer period; he impressed his listeners as articulate. He indicated
that he had become disillusioned during his stay in Russia, and
that in his opinion the best political system would be one which combined
the best points of capitalism and communism.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1076" href="#Footnote_A13-1076" class="fnanchor">A13-1076</a> While he left
his listeners with the impression that he was an atheist, he avoided a
direct discussion of religion. The group returned to New Orleans on
July 28.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1077" href="#Footnote_A13-1077" class="fnanchor">A13-1077</a></p>

<p>In late May and early June, Oswald had apparently begun to
formulate plans for creating a New Orleans branch of the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee. Using the name “Lee Osborne” he ordered a
number of printed circulars demanding “Hands off Cuba” in large
letters, and application forms and membership cards for the proposed
chapter.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1078" href="#Footnote_A13-1078" class="fnanchor">A13-1078</a> On August 5, he visited a store managed by Carlos Bringuier,
a Cuban refugee and avid opponent of Castro and the New Orleans
delegate of the Cuban student directorate. Oswald indicated
an interest in joining the struggle against Castro. He told Bringuier
that he had been a marine and was trained in guerrilla warfare, and
that he was willing not only to train Cubans to fight Castro but also
to join the fight himself. The next day Oswald returned to the store
and left his “Guidebook for Marines” for Bringuier.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1079" href="#Footnote_A13-1079" class="fnanchor">A13-1079</a></p>

<p>On August 9, Bringuier saw Oswald passing out Fair Play for
Cuba leaflets. Bringuier and his companions became angry and a
dispute resulted. Oswald and the three Cuban exiles were arrested
for disturbing the peace.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1080" href="#Footnote_A13-1080" class="fnanchor">A13-1080</a> Oswald spent the night in jail and was
interviewed the next day by a lieutenant of the New Orleans Police
Department. At Oswald’s request, an FBI agent also interviewed
him. Oswald maintained that he was a member of the New Orleans
branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee which, he claimed, had
35 members. He stated also that he had been in touch with the president
of that organization, A. J. Hidell.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1081" href="#Footnote_A13-1081" class="fnanchor">A13-1081</a> Oswald was in fact the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_729">729</span>
only member of the “New Orleans branch,” which had never been
chartered by the National Fair Play for Cuba Committee.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1082" href="#Footnote_A13-1082" class="fnanchor">A13-1082</a> Later
that day Oswald was released on bail, and 2 days later he pleaded
guilty to the charges against him and paid a $10 fine. The charges
against the Cuban exiles were dismissed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1083" href="#Footnote_A13-1083" class="fnanchor">A13-1083</a> Marina testified that the
arrest upset Lee and that he “became less active, he cooled off a little”
after it.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1084" href="#Footnote_A13-1084" class="fnanchor">A13-1084</a></p>

<p>On August 16, Oswald, assisted by at least one other person who
was a hired helper, again passed out Fair Play for Cuba literature, this
time in front of the International Trade Mart. That night, television
newscasts ran pictures of Oswald’s activities.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1085" href="#Footnote_A13-1085" class="fnanchor">A13-1085</a> (This hindered Oswald’s
subsequent attempts to obtain employment in New Orleans.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-1086" href="#Footnote_A13-1086" class="fnanchor">A13-1086</a>
Bringuier sent one of his friends to Oswald’s home to pose as a Castro
sympathizer and attempt to obtain information about Oswald, but
Oswald apparently saw through the ruse.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1087" href="#Footnote_A13-1087" class="fnanchor">A13-1087</a></p>

<p>William Stuckey, a radio broadcaster with a program called “Latin
Listening Post,” had long been looking for a member of the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee to appear on his program. He learned
about Oswald from Bringuier, and visited Oswald on August 17.
Later that day, Stuckey recorded an interview with Oswald which was
cut to about 5 minutes and played back on the show that evening.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1088" href="#Footnote_A13-1088" class="fnanchor">A13-1088</a>
Two days later, Stuckey asked the news director of the station if he
could run the entire tape, but the director felt that a debate with a
local opponent of Castro would be of greater public interest. Consequently,
Stuckey arranged for a debate between Oswald and Bringuier
on a 25-minute daily public affairs program called “Conversation
Carte Blanche,” which took place on August 21.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1089" href="#Footnote_A13-1089" class="fnanchor">A13-1089</a> Oswald
defended the Castro regime and discussed Marxism. He was put on
the defensive when his defection to Russia was brought up,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1090" href="#Footnote_A13-1090" class="fnanchor">A13-1090</a> and
Stuckey later testified that he thought that the program had finished
the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1091" href="#Footnote_A13-1091" class="fnanchor">A13-1091</a> However,
Stuckey also testified that Oswald seemed to be a clean-cut and
intelligent person who conducted himself very well during the interviews
and debates.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1092" href="#Footnote_A13-1092" class="fnanchor">A13-1092</a></p>

<p>Oswald wrote several times to V. T. Lee, then national director
of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, telling him, sometimes in exaggerated
terms, of his activities.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1093" href="#Footnote_A13-1093" class="fnanchor">A13-1093</a> He wrote also to the Communist
Party and asked whether, in view of his prior defection, he should
“continue to fight, handicapped as it were, by * * * [his] past record,
[and] compete with anti-progressive forces, above-ground or
* * * should always remain in the background, i.e., underground.” <a id="FNanchor_A13-1094" href="#Footnote_A13-1094" class="fnanchor">A13-1094</a>
The Party replied that “often it is advisable for some people to remain
in the background, not underground.” <a id="FNanchor_A13-1095" href="#Footnote_A13-1095" class="fnanchor">A13-1095</a> And although Oswald
wrote four letters to V. T. Lee during the summer,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1096" href="#Footnote_A13-1096" class="fnanchor">A13-1096</a> there is no
evidence that Oswald heard from him after May 29.</p>

<p>Ruth Paine arrived in New Orleans on September 20, and spent
three nights with the Oswalds. During this stay, Mrs. Paine found
relations between them much improved. Nonetheless, it was decided
that Marina would go back with her to Irving for the birth of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_730">730</span>
baby. Marina and Mrs. Paine toured Bourbon Street while Oswald
stayed home and did some packing for Marina’s return to Texas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1097" href="#Footnote_A13-1097" class="fnanchor">A13-1097</a>
On Sunday, September 22, Oswald and Mrs. Paine finished loading
the station wagon with the Oswalds’ household belongings.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1098" href="#Footnote_A13-1098" class="fnanchor">A13-1098</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr247">MEXICO CITY</h3>

<p>Marina Oswald testified that sometime in August her husband first
told her of his plan to go to Mexico and from there to Cuba, where
he planned to stay; he had given up a plan to hijack an airplane and
fly directly to Cuba, which plan Marina consistently opposed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1099" href="#Footnote_A13-1099" class="fnanchor">A13-1099</a> On
September 17, he obtained from the Mexican consulate general in New
Orleans a “Tourist Card,” FM-8 No. 24085, good for one journey
into Mexico for no longer than 15 days. Typed in the blank, “Appelidos
y nombre,” was “Lee, Harvey Oswald,” “Fotogrofo”;
the intended destination was shown as Mexico City.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1100" href="#Footnote_A13-1100" class="fnanchor">A13-1100</a> (The comma
between “Lee” and “Harvey” seems to have been an error.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-1101" href="#Footnote_A13-1101" class="fnanchor">A13-1101</a> On
the application Oswald stated that he was employed at “640 Rampart”;
he was in fact unemployed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1102" href="#Footnote_A13-1102" class="fnanchor">A13-1102</a> (See Commission Exhibits Nos.
2478, 2481, <a href="#Page_300">p. 300</a>.)</p>

<p>Marina and June departed with Mrs. Ruth Paine for Irving on the
morning of September 23.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1103" href="#Footnote_A13-1103" class="fnanchor">A13-1103</a> Before she left, Oswald told Marina
that she should not tell anyone about his impending trip to
Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1104" href="#Footnote_A13-1104" class="fnanchor">A13-1104</a> Marina kept this secret until after the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1105" href="#Footnote_A13-1105" class="fnanchor">A13-1105</a>
On the previous day, Oswald’s landlord had seen Mrs. Paine’s car
being packed and had asked Oswald, whose rent was about 15 days
overdue, whether he was leaving. Oswald told him that Marina was
leaving temporarily but that he would remain.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1106" href="#Footnote_A13-1106" class="fnanchor">A13-1106</a> A neighbor testified
that on the evening of September 24, he saw Oswald, carrying
two pieces of luggage, hurriedly leave the Magazine Street
apartment and board a bus.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1107" href="#Footnote_A13-1107" class="fnanchor">A13-1107</a> Though uncertain of the exact date,
a city busdriver recalls that at the same time of day and at the same
location he picked up a man who was carrying two suitcases of different
sizes and helped him place them so that they would not disturb
the other passengers. The driver remembers that the man asked
directions to the Greyhound bus station. He discharged the passenger
at an intersection where he could board a Canal Street car and
transfer to another bus which would go past the Greyhound and Continental
Trailways stations.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1108" href="#Footnote_A13-1108" class="fnanchor">A13-1108</a> The landlord found Oswald’s apartment
vacant on September 25.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1109" href="#Footnote_A13-1109" class="fnanchor">A13-1109</a></p>

<p>Oswald appears to have taken with him a Spanish-English dictionary;<a id="FNanchor_A13-1110" href="#Footnote_A13-1110" class="fnanchor">A13-1110</a>
his address book;<a id="FNanchor_A13-1111" href="#Footnote_A13-1111" class="fnanchor">A13-1111</a> his 1963 passport and old passport;<a id="FNanchor_A13-1112" href="#Footnote_A13-1112" class="fnanchor">A13-1112</a>
his correspondence with the Communist Party and with the Soviet
Embassy in Washington, some of which was in Russian;<a id="FNanchor_A13-1113" href="#Footnote_A13-1113" class="fnanchor">A13-1113</a> proof of
his marriage;<a id="FNanchor_A13-1114" href="#Footnote_A13-1114" class="fnanchor">A13-1114</a> newspaper clippings concerning his arrest and his
interest in the activities of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee<a id="FNanchor_A13-1115" href="#Footnote_A13-1115" class="fnanchor">A13-1115</a> (activities
which, Marina testified, he had undertaken because he thought
that they would help him when he got to Cuba);<a id="FNanchor_A13-1116" href="#Footnote_A13-1116" class="fnanchor">A13-1116</a> evidence that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_731">731</span>
was the “Director” of the New Orleans chapter of the Committee;<a id="FNanchor_A13-1117" href="#Footnote_A13-1117" class="fnanchor">A13-1117</a>
and various other cards, such as a work card, which he had obtained in
Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1118" href="#Footnote_A13-1118" class="fnanchor">A13-1118</a> He took also several sheets of notepaper on which he had
written a summary of important events in his life which he presumably
intended to call to the attention of Cuban and Soviet officials in
Mexico City to convince them to let him enter Cuba. On these sheets
he had recorded facts about his Marine service, including the dates
of his enlistment and discharge, the places where he had served, and
the diplomas that he had received from military school. Recorded
also were notes on his stay in the Soviet Union, his early interest in
Communist literature, his ability to speak Russian, his organization
of the New Orleans chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee,
his contact with police authorities in connection with his work for
the Committee, and his experience in “street agitation,” as a “radio
speaker and lecturer,” and as a photographer.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1119" href="#Footnote_A13-1119" class="fnanchor">A13-1119</a> The two pieces of
luggage which Oswald took with him were a small, blue, zipper bag<a id="FNanchor_A13-1120" href="#Footnote_A13-1120" class="fnanchor">A13-1120</a>
and a large, olive-colored bag,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1121" href="#Footnote_A13-1121" class="fnanchor">A13-1121</a> both made of cloth. He carried
the smaller bag with him throughout the trip, but, at least from
Nuevo Laredo to Mexico City, checked the larger one through to his
destination.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1122" href="#Footnote_A13-1122" class="fnanchor">A13-1122</a></p>

<p>Oswald remained in New Orleans until September 25. His precise
whereabouts on the night of September 24 are uncertain, but in view
of his limited finances, he probably returned to the apartment to sleep
after checking his luggage at a bus station or spent the night at an
inexpensive hotel or roominghouse. Some time after 5 a.m. on September
25, he collected a Texas unemployment compensation check
for $33 at his New Orleans post office box. He cashed the check between
8 a.m. and noon at a store about six blocks from his apartment
on Magazine Street.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1123" href="#Footnote_A13-1123" class="fnanchor">A13-1123</a> This gave him about $200 for the trip to
Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1124" href="#Footnote_A13-1124" class="fnanchor">A13-1124</a></p>

<p>He left New Orleans by bus,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1125" href="#Footnote_A13-1125" class="fnanchor">A13-1125</a> probably on Continental Trailways
Bus No. 5121, departing New Orleans at 12:20 p.m. on September 25,
and scheduled to arrive in Houston at 10:50 p.m.; that bus is the only
one on which Oswald could have left New Orleans after noon on September
25<a id="FNanchor_A13-1126" href="#Footnote_A13-1126" class="fnanchor">A13-1126</a> and arrived in Houston before midnight.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1127" href="#Footnote_A13-1127" class="fnanchor">A13-1127</a> Sometime
in the evening he called the home of Horace Elroy Twiford, a
member of the Socialist Labor Party who had received Oswald’s name
from the party’s headquarters in New York and sent him a copy of
its official publication, the “Weekly People.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-1128" href="#Footnote_A13-1128" class="fnanchor">A13-1128</a> Mrs. Twiford, who
answered the telephone,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1129" href="#Footnote_A13-1129" class="fnanchor">A13-1129</a> believes that the call was made locally,
before 10 p.m. It may have been made from Beaumont or some other
stop on the route; however, in view of the bus schedule, it probably was
made in Houston later than Mrs. Twiford remembered.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1130" href="#Footnote_A13-1130" class="fnanchor">A13-1130</a> Oswald
told Mrs. Twiford that he was a member of the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee and that he hoped to see her husband for a few hours that
evening before he flew to Mexico. He wanted also to find out how
Twiford had obtained his name and address. Mrs. Twiford told
Oswald that her husband, a merchant seaman, was at sea but would be
happy to see him at some other time; she offered to take a message.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_732">732</span>
Oswald said that he could not await her husband’s return because he
was flying to Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1131" href="#Footnote_A13-1131" class="fnanchor">A13-1131</a> The Twifords have stated that they had no
other contact with Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1132" href="#Footnote_A13-1132" class="fnanchor">A13-1132</a></p>

<p>An employee of the U.S. Selective Service System has stated
that an individual calling himself “Harvey Oswald” appeared at her
office in Austin, Tex., immediately after lunch on September 25, and
discussed with her the possibility of rectifying his undesirable discharge
from the Marine Corps.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1133" href="#Footnote_A13-1133" class="fnanchor">A13-1133</a> Despite the employee’s reputability
and apparent sincerity, all of the information which she
furnished with respect to Oswald’s appearance and conversation could
have been derived from news media, consciously or unconsciously, by
the time she told the FBI her story. Other persons in Austin who,
according to the employee’s testimony, should also have observed
Oswald failed to corroborate her testimony.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1134" href="#Footnote_A13-1134" class="fnanchor">A13-1134</a> No other evidence
tending to show that Oswald was in Austin at this time has been
discovered.</p>

<p>The telephone call which Oswald made to the Twifords on the
evening of September 25, indicates that he was either in Houston
or on his way there when he made it, since the purpose of the call
was to make an appointment to see Twiford in Houston that evening.
Oswald could not have left New Orleans on September 25,
been in Austin 521 miles away by early afternoon, and returned 162
miles to Houston by night unless he traveled by air; airline records
contain no indication that Oswald was on such flights.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1135" href="#Footnote_A13-1135" class="fnanchor">A13-1135</a> It is very
unlikely that he had with him enough money beyond what he needed
for the trip to Mexico City to take such flights, and the poor state of
his finances at this time plus his well-established frugality make it
extremely unlikely that he would have considered it worthwhile to do
so even if he could. There is no evidence that Oswald was in such a
hurry to reach Mexico that he would have felt it necessary to travel
by airplane rather than a less expensive means of travel. He
took a bus from Houston to Mexico City, lived very inexpensively
there, and took a bus back to Dallas; there is no apparent reason why
he would have interrupted such an inexpensive trip to fly to Austin
and then to Houston. He told a passenger whom he met on the next
leg of his trip that he had come from New Orleans, and made no reference
to Austin.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1136" href="#Footnote_A13-1136" class="fnanchor">A13-1136</a></p>

<p>On September 26, Oswald boarded Continental Trailways bus No.
5133 in Houston and departed at 2:35 a.m. for Laredo, Tex., via
Corpus Christi and Alice.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1137" href="#Footnote_A13-1137" class="fnanchor">A13-1137</a> Two British tourists, Dr. and Mrs.
John B. McFarland, who boarded No. 5133 in Houston, noticed Oswald
when they awoke at about 6 a.m. Oswald told them that he was
going to Cuba via Mexico City, and they inferred from conversation
with him that he had left New Orleans early in the afternoon of
September 25 and that he was going to Cuba via Mexico City. He
said also that he was secretary of the New Orleans branch of the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee and that he hoped to see Fidel Castro in
Cuba. The bus was scheduled to arrive in Laredo at approximately
1:20 p.m.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_733">733</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-1138" href="#Footnote_A13-1138" class="fnanchor">A13-1138</a></p>

<p>Oswald crossed the border from Laredo to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico,
between 1:30 and 2 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1139" href="#Footnote_A13-1139" class="fnanchor">A13-1139</a> From Nuevo Laredo, he traveled to Mexico
City aboard bus No. 516 of the Flecha Roja Bus Line, which departed
at 2:15 p.m. and was scheduled to arrive in Mexico City at 9:45 a.m.
on the following day; he held baggage claim check No. 320435.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1140" href="#Footnote_A13-1140" class="fnanchor">A13-1140</a> He
was seen on the bus by the McFarlands and by two Australian girls
who boarded the bus on the evening of September 26 at Monterrey.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1141" href="#Footnote_A13-1141" class="fnanchor">A13-1141</a>
He occupied the seat next to an elderly Englishman, who told the girls
that the young man sitting next to him apparently had been to Mexico
before.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1142" href="#Footnote_A13-1142" class="fnanchor">A13-1142</a> The man next to Oswald was probably Albert Osborne,
a native of the British Isles who has worked as an itinerant preacher in
the Southern United States and Mexico for many years. Osborne
denied that he sat beside Oswald; but in view of his inconsistent and
untrue responses to Federal investigators concerning matters not directly
related to Oswald, the Commission believes that his denial
cannot be credited. It appeared to the other passengers on the bus
that Osborne and Oswald had not previously met; extensive investigation
has revealed no other contact between them.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1143" href="#Footnote_A13-1143" class="fnanchor">A13-1143</a></p>

<p>In the course of the 20-hour bus trip, Oswald initiated two conversations
with the Australian girls, during which he mentioned his visit
to Russia and recommended the Hotel Cuba in Mexico City as a
“clean and cheap” hotel; he told them, apparently falsely, that he had
stayed there on previous occasions. He said that when he had seen
them board the bus with their heavy suitcases, he had been under the
impression that they were Mexican and had therefore asked the man
next to him how to say “How can I help you?” in Spanish. From this
they inferred that Oswald did not speak Spanish, an impression which
is shared by every witness who met Oswald on his trip and is supported
by notations which he made on documents that he carried.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1144" href="#Footnote_A13-1144" class="fnanchor">A13-1144</a>
He got off the bus at every stop and ate large meals, always eating by
himself; the girls thought he ate so much because he could not make
himself understood in Spanish and had to order by pointing at the
menu.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1145" href="#Footnote_A13-1145" class="fnanchor">A13-1145</a> The bus arrived in Mexico City 15 minutes late, at 10
a.m.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1146" href="#Footnote_A13-1146" class="fnanchor">A13-1146</a> Oswald left the bus station by himself and had no known
further contact with any of the people with whom he had spoken on the
bus.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1147" href="#Footnote_A13-1147" class="fnanchor">A13-1147</a></p>

<p>Oswald registered at the Hotel del Comercio within an hour of his
arrival in Mexico City. He stayed there throughout his visit.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1148" href="#Footnote_A13-1148" class="fnanchor">A13-1148</a> The
hotel, located not far from the commercial heart of the city and within
four blocks of the bus station, is one of a group of hotels located near
the intercity bus terminals and has perhaps the best appearance of
the group.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1149" href="#Footnote_A13-1149" class="fnanchor">A13-1149</a> It is known by personnel in other hotels that the owner
of the Hotel del Comercio can understand and speak a little English.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1150" href="#Footnote_A13-1150" class="fnanchor">A13-1150</a>
Oswald registered as “Lee, Harvey Oswald,” and gave his
occupation as “photo.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-1151" href="#Footnote_A13-1151" class="fnanchor">A13-1151</a> He had room 18 which cost $1.28 per
day.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1152" href="#Footnote_A13-1152" class="fnanchor">A13-1152</a></p>

<p>After he had registered, Oswald turned promptly to the task of
obtaining permission to enter Cuba. Mexican officials would not permit
a U.S. citizen without a Cuban visa to board a plane for Cuba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_734">734</span>
even if he had an American passport, but would permit passage if he
had a visa even though the passport proscribed travel to Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1153" href="#Footnote_A13-1153" class="fnanchor">A13-1153</a>
Oswald had a 1963 American passport (stamped invalid for travel to
Cuba)<a id="FNanchor_A13-1154" href="#Footnote_A13-1154" class="fnanchor">A13-1154</a> but had neither a regular Cuban visa nor an intransit visa
which would permit a short stay in Cuba on his way to Russia or some
other country. His address book contained the telephone number and
address of a Cuban airline, but there is evidence that he never visited
its office.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1155" href="#Footnote_A13-1155" class="fnanchor">A13-1155</a></p>

<p>He visited the Cuban Embassy on Friday, September 27 and spoke
with Senora Silvia Tirado de Duran, a Mexican citizen employed there.
Senora Duran later made a signed statement to the Mexican police
that Oswald:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * applied for a visa to Cuba in transit to Russia and based
his application on his presentation of his passport in which it
was recorded that he had been living in the latter country for a
period of three years, his work permit from that same country
written in the Russian language and letters in the same language,
as well as proof of his being married to a woman of Russian nationality
and being the apparent Director in the city of New
Orleans of the organization called “Fair Play for Cuba” with
the desire that he should be accepted as a “friend” of the Cuban
Revolution * * * <a id="FNanchor_A13-1156" href="#Footnote_A13-1156" class="fnanchor">A13-1156</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">He apparently also stated that he was a member of the Communist
Party and displayed documents which he claimed to be evidence of
his membership.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1157" href="#Footnote_A13-1157" class="fnanchor">A13-1157</a> He said that he intended to go to Cuba on September
30 and to remain there for 2 weeks, or longer if possible, and then
go on to Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1158" href="#Footnote_A13-1158" class="fnanchor">A13-1158</a> Senora Duran took down the relevant date and
filled out the appropriate application. Oswald left the Embassy but
was to return in the afternoon.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1159" href="#Footnote_A13-1159" class="fnanchor">A13-1159</a></p>

<p>Then, or possibly even before his initial visit to the Cuban Embassy
Oswald went to the Soviet Embassy where he spoke with either Pavel
Antonovich Yatskov or Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1160" href="#Footnote_A13-1160" class="fnanchor">A13-1160</a> They
are both consular officials serving also as agents of the KGB.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1161" href="#Footnote_A13-1161" class="fnanchor">A13-1161</a>
Oswald later said that he had dealt with “Kostin,”<a id="FNanchor_A13-1162" href="#Footnote_A13-1162" class="fnanchor">A13-1162</a> undoubtedly
a reference to Kostikov. He was unable to obtain a Soviet visa then.
Marina said that the officials at the Soviet Embassy “refused to have
anything to do with him.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-1163" href="#Footnote_A13-1163" class="fnanchor">A13-1163</a></p>

<p>Oswald returned to the Cuban Embassy later that afternoon, this
time bringing with him passport photographs which he may have obtained
in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1164" href="#Footnote_A13-1164" class="fnanchor">A13-1164</a> Senora Duran telephoned the Soviet
Embassy to inquire about the status of Oswald’s Russian visa and was
told that there would be a delay of about 4 months.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1165" href="#Footnote_A13-1165" class="fnanchor">A13-1165</a> Oswald became
“highly agitated and angry,” particularly when he learned that he
could not obtain an intransit visa to Cuba before he acquired a Russian
visa. Senora Duran called the Cuban consul, then Eusibio Azque, to
speak to him. The discussion between Oswald and Azque developed
into a heated argument, which ended when Azque told Oswald that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_735">735</span>
his opinion people like Oswald were harming the Cuban Revolution
and that so far as Azque was concerned, he would not give Oswald
a visa.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1166" href="#Footnote_A13-1166" class="fnanchor">A13-1166</a> Senora Duran wrote her name and the phone number of
the Embassy on a piece of paper which she gave to Oswald in case
he wished to contact her again. He copied this information into his
address book.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1167" href="#Footnote_A13-1167" class="fnanchor">A13-1167</a> Senora Duran forwarded the Cuban visa application
to Havana;<a id="FNanchor_A13-1168" href="#Footnote_A13-1168" class="fnanchor">A13-1168</a> the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied
on October 15 that the visa could be issued only after Oswald had
obtained a Russian visa.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1169" href="#Footnote_A13-1169" class="fnanchor">A13-1169</a> (See Commission Exhibit No. 2564,
<a href="#Page_303">p. 303</a>.)</p>

<p>Oswald contacted the Russian and Cuban Embassies again during
his stay in Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1170" href="#Footnote_A13-1170" class="fnanchor">A13-1170</a> He had no greater success than he had before.
Marina testified that when he returned to Texas, he was convinced
that his trip had been a failure and disappointed at having
been unable to go to Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1171" href="#Footnote_A13-1171" class="fnanchor">A13-1171</a> A month later, in a painstakingly
composed<a id="FNanchor_A13-1172" href="#Footnote_A13-1172" class="fnanchor">A13-1172</a> letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, Oswald
ascribed his failure to “a gross breach of regulations” on the part of
the Cuban Embassy. “Of corse,” he wrote, “the Soviet Embassy
was not at fault, they were, as I say unprepared.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-1173" href="#Footnote_A13-1173" class="fnanchor">A13-1173</a></p>

<p>The hotel maid said that Oswald generally was gone by the time
she arrived at 9 a.m. The night watchman said he usually returned
at about midnight,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1174" href="#Footnote_A13-1174" class="fnanchor">A13-1174</a> which is not unusual, in view of the late hour at
which Mexico City’s evening activities begin. He ate several lunches
at a small restaurant immediately adjacent to the hotel, coming to the
restaurant shortly after 2 p.m., and ordering food by pointing to the
menu, apparently with some consideration of cost; he spent between
40 and 48 cents for each meal. He ate the soup of the day, rice, and
either meat or eggs, but refused dessert and coffee; the waitress concluded
that Oswald did not realize that the items which he refused
were included in the price of the lunch.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1175" href="#Footnote_A13-1175" class="fnanchor">A13-1175</a> He was seen with no
other person either at his hotel or at the restaurant.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1176" href="#Footnote_A13-1176" class="fnanchor">A13-1176</a> A hotel guest
stated that on one occasion he sat down at a table with Oswald because
there was no empty table in the restaurant, but that neither spoke to
the other because of the language barrier.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1177" href="#Footnote_A13-1177" class="fnanchor">A13-1177</a></p>

<p>Although the Soviet and Cuban Embassies are within two blocks of
each other, they are some distance from Oswald’s hotel.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1178" href="#Footnote_A13-1178" class="fnanchor">A13-1178</a> He must,
therefore, have traversed a substantial portion of the city on more
than one occasion. Marina testified that he told her that he had seen
a bullfight,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1179" href="#Footnote_A13-1179" class="fnanchor">A13-1179</a> which would normally have been on Sunday afternoon,
and that he had visited museums<a id="FNanchor_A13-1180" href="#Footnote_A13-1180" class="fnanchor">A13-1180</a> and done some sightseeing.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1181" href="#Footnote_A13-1181" class="fnanchor">A13-1181</a>
He apparently also saw one or more motion pictures, either American
with Spanish subtitles or Mexican with English subtitles.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1182" href="#Footnote_A13-1182" class="fnanchor">A13-1182</a> From
notations in his Spanish-English dictionary and on his guide map of
Mexico City, it appears that Oswald intended to attend a jai alai
game<a id="FNanchor_A13-1183" href="#Footnote_A13-1183" class="fnanchor">A13-1183</a> but he almost certainly did not do so.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1184" href="#Footnote_A13-1184" class="fnanchor">A13-1184</a></p>

<p>He purchased several postcards depicting bullfights and tourist attractions,
which he brought back to Marina.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1185" href="#Footnote_A13-1185" class="fnanchor">A13-1185</a> She had told him before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_736">736</span>
he left that she would like Mexican silver bracelets as a souvenir,
and he brought her a silver bracelet inscribed with her name.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1186" href="#Footnote_A13-1186" class="fnanchor">A13-1186</a>
Marina suspected, almost certainly correctly, that the bracelet, of Japanese
origin, did not come from Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1187" href="#Footnote_A13-1187" class="fnanchor">A13-1187</a> No such jewelry is known
to be sold in or around Mexico City, because of a high duty<a id="FNanchor_A13-1188" href="#Footnote_A13-1188" class="fnanchor">A13-1188</a> but
the bracelet is of a type commonly sold in 5-and-10-cent stores in
Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1189" href="#Footnote_A13-1189" class="fnanchor">A13-1189</a> Oswald did not buy the Mexican phonograph records
which Marina had requested, despite the notation, “records,” which
he had placed in his dictionary.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1190" href="#Footnote_A13-1190" class="fnanchor">A13-1190</a></p>

<p>On Monday, September 30, Oswald began to prepare for his return
to the United States. He appeared at the Agencia de Viages,
Transportes Chihuahuenses,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1191" href="#Footnote_A13-1191" class="fnanchor">A13-1191</a> and purchased international exchange
orders costing $20.30 for travel on a Transportes del Norte bus from
Mexico City to Laredo and by Greyhound bus directly from Laredo to
Dallas. The travel agency made a reservation for him on Transportes
del Norte bus No. 332, departing Mexico City at 8:30 a.m. on
October 2. The seat, No. 12, was reserved in the name of the travel
agency, which recorded the reservation in the name of “H. O. Lee.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-1192" href="#Footnote_A13-1192" class="fnanchor">A13-1192</a>
The employee who made the reservation testified that he probably
wrote the name that way because he was copying from Oswald’s tourist
card, which read “Lee, Harvey Oswald.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-1193" href="#Footnote_A13-1193" class="fnanchor">A13-1193</a> (The manifest for
Transportes Frontera bus No. 340, leaving Mexico City for Monterrey
and Nuevo Laredo at 1 p.m. on Wednesday, October 2, 1963, contains
the name “Oswld” [sic], which apparently was added to the manifest
after the trip;<a id="FNanchor_A13-1194" href="#Footnote_A13-1194" class="fnanchor">A13-1194</a> in any event, Oswald did not take bus 340.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-1195" href="#Footnote_A13-1195" class="fnanchor">A13-1195</a></p>

<p>On October 1, Oswald paid his hotel bill through that night.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1196" href="#Footnote_A13-1196" class="fnanchor">A13-1196</a>
The hotel night watchman remembers helping Oswald obtain a taxicab
at about 6:30 or 7 on the following morning.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1197" href="#Footnote_A13-1197" class="fnanchor">A13-1197</a> Transportes del Norte
bus No. 332 left as scheduled at about 8:30 a.m.; at Monterrey the passengers
were shifted to a relief bus, No. 373, scheduled to depart for
Laredo at 10 p.m. that evening.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1198" href="#Footnote_A13-1198" class="fnanchor">A13-1198</a> Fellow passengers recall that Oswald
was pulled off the bus by Mexican officials at the border, because
of some alleged irregularity in his Mexican tourist papers; one passenger
overheard him mumbling complaints about the Mexican
immigration officials when he returned to the bus.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1199" href="#Footnote_A13-1199" class="fnanchor">A13-1199</a> They remember
also that Oswald was hurriedly “gulping” down a banana after the bus
reached customs, perhaps because he believed that he could not take
fruit into the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1200" href="#Footnote_A13-1200" class="fnanchor">A13-1200</a> (Marina has testified that her husband
liked bananas and frequently ate them.)<a id="FNanchor_A13-1201" href="#Footnote_A13-1201" class="fnanchor">A13-1201</a> One of the passengers
testified that Oswald annoyed him by keeping his overhead light on
to read after 10 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1202" href="#Footnote_A13-1202" class="fnanchor">A13-1202</a> He may have conversed with an elderly
woman on the bus, but he was not traveling with her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1203" href="#Footnote_A13-1203" class="fnanchor">A13-1203</a></p>

<p>At about 1:35 a.m. on October 3, Oswald crossed the International
Bridge from Nuevo Laredo into Texas.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1204" href="#Footnote_A13-1204" class="fnanchor">A13-1204</a> He traveled from Laredo
to Dallas via San Antonio, on Greyhound bus No. 1265, substantially
following Interstate Route 35 for the entire trip<a id="FNanchor_A13-1205" href="#Footnote_A13-1205" class="fnanchor">A13-1205</a> leaving Laredo at
3 a.m. and arriving in Dallas at about 2:20 p.m. on the same day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_737">737</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-1206" href="#Footnote_A13-1206" class="fnanchor">A13-1206</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr248">DALLAS</h3>

<p>Oswald did not contact his wife immediately when he returned to
Dallas. He went to the office of the employment commission, where he
filed an unemployment compensation claim<a id="FNanchor_A13-1207" href="#Footnote_A13-1207" class="fnanchor">A13-1207</a> and announced that
he was again looking for work.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1208" href="#Footnote_A13-1208" class="fnanchor">A13-1208</a> He spent the night at the YMCA,
where he registered as a serviceman in order to avoid paying the
membership fee.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1209" href="#Footnote_A13-1209" class="fnanchor">A13-1209</a> On the following day, he applied for a job as a
typesetter trainee at the Padgett Printing Co. He made a favorable
impression on the department foreman, but the plant superintendent
called Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall and decided not to hire Oswald because
of the unfavorable responses which his inquiries produced.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1210" href="#Footnote_A13-1210" class="fnanchor">A13-1210</a> Later
that day, Oswald telephoned Marina and asked her to have Mrs. Paine
pick him up in Dallas. Marina refused, and he hitchhiked out to the
Paine home,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1211" href="#Footnote_A13-1211" class="fnanchor">A13-1211</a> where he spent part or all of the weekend.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1212" href="#Footnote_A13-1212" class="fnanchor">A13-1212</a> Marina
testified that although her husband “changed for the better” and
treated her better after his Mexican trip,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1213" href="#Footnote_A13-1213" class="fnanchor">A13-1213</a> she did not want to live
with him because she was pregnant and thought it would be better
“to be with a woman who spoke English and Russian.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-1214" href="#Footnote_A13-1214" class="fnanchor">A13-1214</a> On Monday,
October 7, Mrs. Paine drove Oswald to the bus station, and he
returned to Dallas to look for a job and a place to live.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1215" href="#Footnote_A13-1215" class="fnanchor">A13-1215</a></p>

<p>Oswald thought that the YMCA was too expensive for him, and
intended to rent a room.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1216" href="#Footnote_A13-1216" class="fnanchor">A13-1216</a> He inquired about a room at 1026 North
Beckley, where he lived later, but on October 7 there were no vacancies.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1217" href="#Footnote_A13-1217" class="fnanchor">A13-1217</a>
He next responded to a “For Rent” sign at a rooming house
at 621 Marsalis Street. He obtained a room, for which he paid the
weekly rent of $7 in advance, and moved in on the same day.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1218" href="#Footnote_A13-1218" class="fnanchor">A13-1218</a> He
immediately resumed his job-hunting, relying partially on referrals
by the employment commission.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1219" href="#Footnote_A13-1219" class="fnanchor">A13-1219</a> He spent much of the time when
he was not looking for work in his room.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1220" href="#Footnote_A13-1220" class="fnanchor">A13-1220</a> He telephoned his wife
daily.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1221" href="#Footnote_A13-1221" class="fnanchor">A13-1221</a> She wrote: “Lee called twice a day, was worried about my
health and about June.”<a id="FNanchor_A13-1222" href="#Footnote_A13-1222" class="fnanchor">A13-1222</a> On Friday, Oswald told his landlady,
Mrs. Mary Bledsoe, that he was going to Irving for the weekend but
would return the following week. She refused to rent the room to him
for another week because she didn’t like him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1223" href="#Footnote_A13-1223" class="fnanchor">A13-1223</a></p>

<p>Oswald spent the weekend of October 12-13 at Mrs. Paine’s home,
during which time she gave him a driving lesson.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1224" href="#Footnote_A13-1224" class="fnanchor">A13-1224</a> He told her
that he had received the last of the unemployment checks due him,
and that it had been smaller than the previous ones. Mrs. Paine
testified that Oswald was extremely discouraged because his wife was
expecting a baby, he had no job prospects in sight, and he no longer
had any source of income.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1225" href="#Footnote_A13-1225" class="fnanchor">A13-1225</a></p>

<p>On Monday, Mrs. Paine drove Oswald into Dallas, since she had
other business there.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1226" href="#Footnote_A13-1226" class="fnanchor">A13-1226</a> He picked up his bag from Mrs. Bledsoe’s
roominghouse<a id="FNanchor_A13-1227" href="#Footnote_A13-1227" class="fnanchor">A13-1227</a> and later that day rented a room at 1026 North
Beckley Avenue from Mrs. A. C. Johnson for $8 a week. He registered
as O. H. Lee and moved in immediately.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1228" href="#Footnote_A13-1228" class="fnanchor">A13-1228</a> Oswald felt that
this room was more comfortable than the previous one, particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_738">738</span>
because he had television and refrigerator privileges.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1229" href="#Footnote_A13-1229" class="fnanchor">A13-1229</a> He apparently
continued to spend most of his evenings in his room.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1230" href="#Footnote_A13-1230" class="fnanchor">A13-1230</a> He
borrowed books from the library<a id="FNanchor_A13-1231" href="#Footnote_A13-1231" class="fnanchor">A13-1231</a> and had subscriptions to various
periodicals, including Time, the Worker, the Militant, and some Russian
periodicals.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1232" href="#Footnote_A13-1232" class="fnanchor">A13-1232</a></p>

<p>On that Monday, Mrs. Paine mentioned the Oswalds’ financial and
employment problems to neighbors whom she was visiting. Mrs. Linnie
Mae Randle, who was also present, remarked that she thought that
her younger brother, Buell Wesley Frazier, who worked at the Texas
School Book Depository, had said that there was a job opening there.
When Marina heard of this, she asked Mrs. Paine to call the Depository
to see if there was an opening.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1233" href="#Footnote_A13-1233" class="fnanchor">A13-1233</a> Mrs. Paine called Roy S.
Truly, superintendent of the Depository, who indicated that he would
talk to Oswald if he would apply in person.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1234" href="#Footnote_A13-1234" class="fnanchor">A13-1234</a> When Oswald
telephoned the Paine house on Monday evening, Mrs. Paine told him
about this possibility.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1235" href="#Footnote_A13-1235" class="fnanchor">A13-1235</a> On the next day, Oswald was interviewed by
Truly and hired in a temporary capacity. He began work on Wednesday,
October 16. His duties were to fill book orders; his hours were
8 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., for which he received $1.25 an hour.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1236" href="#Footnote_A13-1236" class="fnanchor">A13-1236</a></p>

<p>Both the Oswalds were elated with the new job,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1237" href="#Footnote_A13-1237" class="fnanchor">A13-1237</a> although it apparently
required little skill or experience<a id="FNanchor_A13-1238" href="#Footnote_A13-1238" class="fnanchor">A13-1238</a> and he indicated that he
still hoped to obtain a better job.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1239" href="#Footnote_A13-1239" class="fnanchor">A13-1239</a> He did a satisfactory job at the
Depository,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1240" href="#Footnote_A13-1240" class="fnanchor">A13-1240</a> but he kept to himself and very few of his fellow employees
got to know him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1241" href="#Footnote_A13-1241" class="fnanchor">A13-1241</a></p>

<p>During his first week at work, Oswald became acquainted with
Frazier, with whom he arranged to ride to Irving on weekends.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1242" href="#Footnote_A13-1242" class="fnanchor">A13-1242</a>
On Friday, October 18, Frazier drove him from work to the Paine
home;<a id="FNanchor_A13-1243" href="#Footnote_A13-1243" class="fnanchor">A13-1243</a> since it was his birthday, Marina and Ruth Paine had
arranged a small celebration.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1244" href="#Footnote_A13-1244" class="fnanchor">A13-1244</a> On Sunday, he stayed with June and
the Paine children, while Mrs. Paine drove Marina to Parkland Hospital
where she gave birth to a second daughter, Rachel.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1245" href="#Footnote_A13-1245" class="fnanchor">A13-1245</a> He went
to work on Monday, but that evening visited Marina in the hospital
and spent the night in Irving.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1246" href="#Footnote_A13-1246" class="fnanchor">A13-1246</a> Marina wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Monday evening Lee visited me in the hospital. He was very
happy at the birth of another daughter and even wept a little.
He said that two daughters were better for each other—two sisters.
He stayed with me about two hours.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1247" href="#Footnote_A13-1247" class="fnanchor">A13-1247</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Oswald returned to Dallas the next morning.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1248" href="#Footnote_A13-1248" class="fnanchor">A13-1248</a></p>

<p>Oswald wrote to Arnold Johnson of the Communist Party, U.S.A.,
that on the evening of October 23, he had attended an “ultra right”
meeting headed by Gen. Edwin A. Walker.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1249" href="#Footnote_A13-1249" class="fnanchor">A13-1249</a> Two evenings later,
he accompanied Michael Paine to a meeting of the American Civil
Liberties Union, held at Southern Methodist University.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1250" href="#Footnote_A13-1250" class="fnanchor">A13-1250</a> At this
meeting, a statement was made to the effect that members of the John
Birch Society should not be considered anti-Semitic; Oswald rose
and stated that at the meeting which he had attended 2 days earlier,
he had heard a number of anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic statements.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_739">739</span>
Later in the evening, Oswald became involved in a discussion with several
people, including Frank Krystinik, who was employed with Paine
at the Bell Helicopter plant. During this conversation, Oswald expressed
Marxist views and declared that he was a Marxist, although
denying that he was a Communist. He admitted that the United
States was superior to the Soviet Union in the area of civil liberties
and praised President Kennedy for his work in that connection.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1251" href="#Footnote_A13-1251" class="fnanchor">A13-1251</a>
Krystinik testified that he got the impression that Oswald did not fully
understand the views he was expounding.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1252" href="#Footnote_A13-1252" class="fnanchor">A13-1252</a></p>

<p>Throughout that week Oswald telephoned his wife to inquire about
her health and that of the baby. He spent the weekend at the Paine
home, to which Marina and Rachel had returned during the week.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1253" href="#Footnote_A13-1253" class="fnanchor">A13-1253</a>
On Friday, November 1, he obtained post office box No. 6225 at
the Terminal Annex Post Office Station. He indicated that the box
would also be used to receive mail for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee
and the American Civil Liberties Union.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1254" href="#Footnote_A13-1254" class="fnanchor">A13-1254</a> Once again he
spent the weekend in Irving.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1255" href="#Footnote_A13-1255" class="fnanchor">A13-1255</a></p>

<p>Throughout this period, the FBI had been aware of the whereabouts
of the Oswalds. There was a record in the Dallas office of the FBI that
Oswald subscribed to the Worker, engaged in Fair Play for Cuba
Committee activities and had traveled to Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1256" href="#Footnote_A13-1256" class="fnanchor">A13-1256</a> An FBI agent
visited the Paine home on November 1 and, accompanied by another
agent, again on November 5, and spoke briefly with Mrs. Paine. On
neither occasion was Oswald present.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1257" href="#Footnote_A13-1257" class="fnanchor">A13-1257</a> Ruth Paine noted the agent’s
name and telephone number and, in accordance with her husband’s instructions,
Marina noted the license number of the agent’s automobile,
all of which was subsequenty reported to Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1258" href="#Footnote_A13-1258" class="fnanchor">A13-1258</a> Both Mrs.
Paine and Marina testified that Oswald was troubled by the FBI’s
interest in him.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1259" href="#Footnote_A13-1259" class="fnanchor">A13-1259</a> He declared that the FBI was “trying to inhibit”
his activities,<a id="FNanchor_A13-1260" href="#Footnote_A13-1260" class="fnanchor">A13-1260</a> and wrote the Soviet Embassy in Washington:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Federal Bureu of Investigation is not now interested
in my activities in the progressive organization “Fair Play for
Cuba Committee” of which I was secretary in New Orleans (state
Louisiana) since I no longer reside in that state. However, the
F.B.I. has visted us here in Dallas, Texas, on November 1st.
Agent James P. Hasty warned me that if I engaged in F.P.C.C.
activities in Texas the F.B.I. will again take an “interest” in me.</p>

<p>This agent also ‘suggested’ to Marina Nichilayeva that she
could remain in the United States under F.B.I. ‘protection’, that is,
she could defect from the Soviet Uion, of couse, I and my wife
strongly protested these tactics by the notorious F.B.I.</p>

<p>Please inform us of the arrival of our Soviet entrance visa’s
as soon as they come.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1261" href="#Footnote_A13-1261" class="fnanchor">A13-1261</a> (See Commission Exhibit 15, <a href="#Page_311">p. 311</a>.)</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Marina testified that the statements, both by and to the FBI agents,
to which her husband referred in this letter, were in fact never made.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_740">740</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-1262" href="#Footnote_A13-1262" class="fnanchor">A13-1262</a></p>

<p>The following Friday, November 8, Oswald as usual drove to the
Paine house with Frazier.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1263" href="#Footnote_A13-1263" class="fnanchor">A13-1263</a> On Saturday Mrs. Paine took him to
the Texas Drivers’ License Examining Station, but because it was an
election day the station was closed. Oswald stayed at the Paines
through Monday, November 11, which was Veterans Day. During
the weekend, Mrs. Paine gave Oswald a second driving lesson.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1264" href="#Footnote_A13-1264" class="fnanchor">A13-1264</a></p>

<p>Oswald did not go to Irving on the next weekend. His wife had
asked him not to come because Michael Paine, with whom Oswald
did not get along, would be there to celebrate his daughter’s birthday.
Also, she felt that because he had stayed for 3 days the preceding
weekend, he would abuse Mrs. Paine’s hospitality if he returned
so soon. Oswald telephoned Marina on Saturday afternoon and said
that he had returned to the drivers’ license examining station that
morning but had not waited because there was a long line.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1265" href="#Footnote_A13-1265" class="fnanchor">A13-1265</a></p>

<p>On Sunday, November 17, at Marina’s request, Ruth Paine telephoned
Oswald at the Beckley Avenue number, which he had given
to Marina. When she asked for him, she was told that no one by
that name lived at the address, which greatly surprised her.
On the next day, Oswald telephoned his wife. When she indicated that
she had been upset by the fact that there had been no Lee Oswald at
the number which she had asked Mrs. Paine to call, Oswald became
angry; he said that he was using a fictitious name and that she should
not have called the Beckley Avenue number.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1266" href="#Footnote_A13-1266" class="fnanchor">A13-1266</a> He did not telephone
on the following day, which was unusual.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1267" href="#Footnote_A13-1267" class="fnanchor">A13-1267</a></p>

<p>On the morning of Thursday, November 21, Oswald asked Frazier
to take him to Irving when he went home that evening, saying that
he wanted to pick up some curtain rods.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1268" href="#Footnote_A13-1268" class="fnanchor">A13-1268</a> His arrival was a surprise
because he generally asked Mrs. Paine’s permission before arriving
for a visit.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1269" href="#Footnote_A13-1269" class="fnanchor">A13-1269</a> The women thought that he had come to Irving
because he felt badly about arguing with his wife about the use of the
fictitious name.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1270" href="#Footnote_A13-1270" class="fnanchor">A13-1270</a> He said that he was lonely, because he had not
come the preceding weekend, and told Marina that he “wanted to make
his peace” with her.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1271" href="#Footnote_A13-1271" class="fnanchor">A13-1271</a> He spent the time before dinner on the lawn
playing with his daughter.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1272" href="#Footnote_A13-1272" class="fnanchor">A13-1272</a> However, when he attempted to talk
to his wife she would not answer, which upset him. He asked her to
live with him in Dallas, and she refused.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1273" href="#Footnote_A13-1273" class="fnanchor">A13-1273</a> After supper, Oswald
watched television while the women cleaned the house and prepared
their children for bed.<a id="FNanchor_A13-1274" href="#Footnote_A13-1274" class="fnanchor">A13-1274</a> He retired early in the evening at about 9.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_741">741</span><a id="FNanchor_A13-1275" href="#Footnote_A13-1275" class="fnanchor">A13-1275</a></p>

<span class="subhead">Analysis of Lee Harvey Oswald’s Finances<br />
From June 13, 1962,<br />
Through November 22, 1963</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The following analysis of Lee Harvey Oswald’s receipts and expenditures
for the period June 13, 1962, through November 22, 1963,
contains a complete record of all funds that he and his wife are reported
to have received and disbursed from all known sources. It also
contains an estimate for food, clothing, and incidental expenses, which
include telephone calls, money order and check cashing fees, postage,
local transportation costs, personal care goods and services, local newspapers,
and similar small items. Oswald’s expenditures for food, clothing,
and incidentals were estimated at $100 per month, except for those months
in which his wife and children resided with relatives or
acquaintances. The estimate reflects Oswald’s frugal living habits
during this period, as described in chapter VI of this report. The
Commission has been advised by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of
the U.S. Department of Labor that this estimate is a little higher than
would be normal for a family in Oswald’s income class residing in the
southern region of the United States. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1169.)</p>

<span class="subhead">Transactions Between Lee Harvey Oswald and Marina
Oswald, and the U.S. Department of State and
the Immigration and Naturalization Service
of the U.S. Department of Justice</span></h2>
</div>

<p>From September 4, 1959, when he applied for his first passport,
until shortly before the assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald had numerous
dealings with the U.S. Department of State in Washington and
with the American Embassy in Moscow. In connection with Marina
Oswald’s entry into the United States, the dealings also extended to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service of the Department of Justice.
During the course of these dealings, the Department of State and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service were called upon to decide a
series of legal and administrative questions which arose under the laws
of this country. In order to determine whether Lee Harvey Oswald
or his wife received any treatment not accorded others in similar positions,
the Commission has examined the manner in which the transactions
with the Oswalds were handled and the manner in which the
relevant legal questions were resolved. In light of the facts then available
and the applicable statutes, regulations, and practices in force at
the time, the Commission has found no indication that the treatment
accorded the Oswalds was illegal or different in any respect from the
treatment that other persons similarly situated would have received.</p>

<h3 id="hdr251">ISSUANCE OF PASSPORT IN 1959</h3>

<p>On September 4, 1959, while on active duty with the U.S. Marine
Corps, Oswald applied for a passport before a clerk of the superior
court at Santa Ana, Calif.<a id="FNanchor_A15-1" href="#Footnote_A15-1" class="fnanchor">A15-1</a> On the application Oswald stated that he
intended to leave the United States for 4 months on approximately
September 21, 1959, by ship from New Orleans, La., and that the purposes
of his trip would be to attend the Albert Schweitzer College in
Switzerland<a id="FNanchor_A15-2" href="#Footnote_A15-2" class="fnanchor">A15-2</a> and the University of Turku in Finland, and to visit
Cuba, the Dominican Republic, England, France, Switzerland, Germany,
Finland and Russia as a tourist. With the application, Oswald
submitted a statement signed by a Marine officer that he was to be
discharged from the Corps on September 10, 1959.<a id="FNanchor_A15-3" href="#Footnote_A15-3" class="fnanchor">A15-3</a> The passport,
No. 1733242, was routinely issued on September 10, 1959.<a id="FNanchor_A15-4" href="#Footnote_A15-4" class="fnanchor">A15-4</a> At the
time, the United States proscribed travel to none of the countries
named in Oswald’s application.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_747">747</span></p>

<h3 id="hdr252">OSWALD’S ATTEMPTS TO RENOUNCE HIS U.S. CITIZENSHIP</h3>

<p>American officials in Moscow had no knowledge that Oswald was in
Russia until October 31, 1959,<a id="FNanchor_A15-5" href="#Footnote_A15-5" class="fnanchor">A15-5</a> more than 2 weeks after he had arrived,
since he failed to register at the U.S. Embassy, as Americans traveling
through Russia normally did.<a id="FNanchor_A15-6" href="#Footnote_A15-6" class="fnanchor">A15-6</a> However, on October 31, 1959, a Saturday,
Oswald presented himself at the American Embassy in
Moscow.<a id="FNanchor_A15-7" href="#Footnote_A15-7" class="fnanchor">A15-7</a> He placed his passport on the receptionist’s desk and informed
her that he had come to “dissolve his American citizenship.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-8" href="#Footnote_A15-8" class="fnanchor">A15-8</a>
She immediately summoned the consul, Richard E. Snyder, who invited
Oswald into his office.<a id="FNanchor_A15-9" href="#Footnote_A15-9" class="fnanchor">A15-9</a> In the room with Snyder was his
assistant, John A. McVickar, who observed what ensued.<a id="FNanchor_A15-10" href="#Footnote_A15-10" class="fnanchor">A15-10</a> Snyder
recalled Oswald as “neatly and very presentably dressed,”<a id="FNanchor_A15-11" href="#Footnote_A15-11" class="fnanchor">A15-11</a> but he
also remembered his arrogance. Oswald seemed to “know what his
mission was. He took charge, in a sense, of the conversation right
from the beginning.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-12" href="#Footnote_A15-12" class="fnanchor">A15-12</a></p>

<p>Oswald stated at once that he was there to renounce his citizenship<a id="FNanchor_A15-13" href="#Footnote_A15-13" class="fnanchor">A15-13</a>
and that “his allegiance was to the Soviet Union.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-14" href="#Footnote_A15-14" class="fnanchor">A15-14</a> He said he had
already applied for Soviet citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_A15-15" href="#Footnote_A15-15" class="fnanchor">A15-15</a> He said he knew the provisions
of American law on loss of citizenship and did not want to hear
them reviewed by Snyder.<a id="FNanchor_A15-16" href="#Footnote_A15-16" class="fnanchor">A15-16</a> Having taken his passport back from
the receptionist, Oswald put it on Snyder’s desk.<a id="FNanchor_A15-17" href="#Footnote_A15-17" class="fnanchor">A15-17</a> Snyder noticed that
Oswald had inked out the portion which would have shown his address
in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A15-18" href="#Footnote_A15-18" class="fnanchor">A15-18</a> Oswald also presented Snyder with a note<a id="FNanchor_A15-19" href="#Footnote_A15-19" class="fnanchor">A15-19</a>
which he had prepared in advance, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I Lee Harey Oswald do herby request that my present citizenship
in the United States of america, be revoked.</p>

<p>I have entered the Soviet Union for the express purpose of
appling for citizenship in the Soviet Union, through the means
of naturalization.</p>

<p>My request for citizenship is now pending before Suprem Soviet
of the U.S.S.R.</p>

<p>I take these steps for political reasons. My request for the
revoking of my American citizenship is made only after the
longest and most serious considerations.</p>

<p>I affirm that my allegiance is to the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics.<a id="FNanchor_A15-20" href="#Footnote_A15-20" class="fnanchor">A15-20</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Oswald told Snyder that he had not mentioned his intent to remain
in the Soviet Union to the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki at the time
he had applied for his tourist visa.<a id="FNanchor_A15-21" href="#Footnote_A15-21" class="fnanchor">A15-21</a> Oswald’s passport, upon which
his Soviet visa was stamped, shows that by the 31st of October he had
already overstayed his visa, despite a 1-day extension which he had
received.<a id="FNanchor_A15-22" href="#Footnote_A15-22" class="fnanchor">A15-22</a></p>

<p>Oswald gave as his “principal reason” for wanting to renounce
his citizenship, “I am a Marxist.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-23" href="#Footnote_A15-23" class="fnanchor">A15-23</a> He stated that he admired the
system and policies of the Soviet Union and desired to serve the Soviet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_748">748</span>
State, and that his intent to defect to the Soviet Union had been formed
long before he was discharged from the Marine Corps.<a id="FNanchor_A15-24" href="#Footnote_A15-24" class="fnanchor">A15-24</a> Shortly
after the interview, Snyder observed that Oswald had “displayed all
the airs of a new sophomore partyliner.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-25" href="#Footnote_A15-25" class="fnanchor">A15-25</a> At one point, Oswald
alluded to hardships endured by his mother as a “worker” and said
he did not intend to let this happen to him.<a id="FNanchor_A15-26" href="#Footnote_A15-26" class="fnanchor">A15-26</a> He stated that his Marine
service in Okinawa and elsewhere had given him a chance “to observe
American imperialism,” and he displayed some resentment at not
having been given a higher rank in the Marine Corps.<a id="FNanchor_A15-27" href="#Footnote_A15-27" class="fnanchor">A15-27</a> Oswald
stated to Snyder that he had voluntarily told Soviet officials that he
would make known to them all information concerning the Marine
Corps and his specialty therein, radar operation, as he possessed.<a id="FNanchor_A15-28" href="#Footnote_A15-28" class="fnanchor">A15-28</a></p>

<p>Snyder did not permit Oswald to renounce his citizenship at that
time. He told Oswald that his renunciation could not be effected on a
Saturday, but that if he would return on a day when the Embassy was
open for business, the transaction could then be completed.<a id="FNanchor_A15-29" href="#Footnote_A15-29" class="fnanchor">A15-29</a> Snyder
testified that his real reason for delaying Oswald was that he believed,
as a matter of sound professional practice, that no one should be permitted
to renounce his American citizenship precipitously; such an
act has extremely serious consequences, and, once accomplished, it is
irrevocable.<a id="FNanchor_A15-30" href="#Footnote_A15-30" class="fnanchor">A15-30</a> Snyder noticed that Oswald was young, apparently
not well educated and obviously in a highly emotional state.<a id="FNanchor_A15-31" href="#Footnote_A15-31" class="fnanchor">A15-31</a> Snyder
testified: “particularly in the case of a minor, I could not imagine myself
writing out the renunciation form, and having him sign it, on the
spot, without making him leave my office and come back at some other
time, even if it is only a few hours intervening.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-32" href="#Footnote_A15-32" class="fnanchor">A15-32</a> Snyder’s decision
was also influenced by his familiarity with a recent unfavorable incident
in which an American citizen by the name of Petrulli had been
allowed to renounce his citizenship hastily, without awareness that
Petrulli was mentally ill at the time.<a id="FNanchor_A15-33" href="#Footnote_A15-33" class="fnanchor">A15-33</a> Snyder was able to persuade
Oswald to tell him his home address and the name of his mother,
however, by saying that no progress on his renunciation could be made
without this information.<a id="FNanchor_A15-34" href="#Footnote_A15-34" class="fnanchor">A15-34</a> The State Department has advised that
Snyder’s treatment of Oswald “was in line * * * with the general
policy of the Department to discourage expatriation of American
citizens.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-35" href="#Footnote_A15-35" class="fnanchor">A15-35</a></p>

<p>The same day, the Embassy sent a telegram to the Department of
State, advising that Oswald had appeared there in an attempt to
renounce his American citizenship, and setting out most of the details
of the interview with Snyder.<a id="FNanchor_A15-36" href="#Footnote_A15-36" class="fnanchor">A15-36</a> Copies were immediately furnished
to the FBI<a id="FNanchor_A15-37" href="#Footnote_A15-37" class="fnanchor">A15-37</a> and the CIA.<a id="FNanchor_A15-38" href="#Footnote_A15-38" class="fnanchor">A15-38</a> The telegram was followed on November
2, 1959, by an Embassy report addresed to the Department
of State,<a id="FNanchor_A15-39" href="#Footnote_A15-39" class="fnanchor">A15-39</a> which concluded:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * in view of the Petrulli case and other considerations, the
Embassy proposes to delay action on Oswald’s request to execute
an oath of renunciation to the extent dictated by developments
and subject to the Department’s advice.<a id="FNanchor_A15-40" href="#Footnote_A15-40" class="fnanchor">A15-40</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_749">749</span>
Copies of this memorandum were also furnished both Federal security
agencies.<a id="FNanchor_A15-41" href="#Footnote_A15-41" class="fnanchor">A15-41</a></p>

<p>After having received the telegram of October 31, 1959,<a id="FNanchor_A15-42" href="#Footnote_A15-42" class="fnanchor">A15-42</a> but not
the Embassy Despatch of November 2, 1959, the State Department on
November 2, 1959, sent a telegram to the Moscow Embassy which read
in part:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If Oswald insists on renouncing U.S. citizenship, Section 1999
Revised Statutes precludes Embassy withholding right to do so
regardless status his application pending Soviet Government and
final action taken Petrulli case.<a id="FNanchor_A15-43" href="#Footnote_A15-43" class="fnanchor">A15-43</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This telegram, like most of the communications from the Department
regarding Oswald, was prepared in the Passport Office and cleared by
the Office of Eastern European Affairs and the Office of Soviet Union
Affairs.<a id="FNanchor_A15-44" href="#Footnote_A15-44" class="fnanchor">A15-44</a></p>

<p>Oswald never returned to the Embassy.<a id="FNanchor_A15-45" href="#Footnote_A15-45" class="fnanchor">A15-45</a> On November 6, 1959,
the Embassy received<a id="FNanchor_A15-46" href="#Footnote_A15-46" class="fnanchor">A15-46</a> a handwritten letter from Oswald on the
stationery of the Metropole Hotel, dated November 3, 1959, which
read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I, Lee Harvey Oswald, do hereby request that my present
United States citizenship be revoked.</p>

<p>I appeered in person, at the consulate office of the United
States Embassy, Moscow, on Oct. 31st, for the purpose of signing
the formal papers to this effect. This legal right I was refused
at that time.</p>

<p>I wish to protest against this action, and against the conduct
of the official of the United States consular service who acted
on behalf of the United States government.</p>

<p>My application, requesting that I be considered for citizenship
in the Soviet Union is now pending before the Surprem Soviet
of the U.S.S.R.. In the event of acceptance, I will request my
government to lodge a formal protest regarding this incident.<a id="FNanchor_A15-47" href="#Footnote_A15-47" class="fnanchor">A15-47</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Embassy immediately informed the Department of the receipt
of this letter and advised that it intended to reply to Oswald by letter
telling him that, if he wished, he could appear at the Embassy on
any normal business day and request that the necessary expatriation
documents be prepared.<a id="FNanchor_A15-48" href="#Footnote_A15-48" class="fnanchor">A15-48</a> On the same day, November 6, the Embassy
sent Oswald a letter so advising him.<a id="FNanchor_A15-49" href="#Footnote_A15-49" class="fnanchor">A15-49</a> From then until November 30
the Embassy attempted to communicate with Oswald on several occasions
to deliver messages from his relatives in the United States urging
him to reconsider, but he refused to receive the messages or talk to
anyone from the Embassy.<a id="FNanchor_A15-50" href="#Footnote_A15-50" class="fnanchor">A15-50</a> The messages were therefore sent to
him by registered mail.<a id="FNanchor_A15-51" href="#Footnote_A15-51" class="fnanchor">A15-51</a></p>

<p>On November 16, 1959, Priscilla Johnson, an American newspaperwoman
stationed in Moscow, interviewed Oswald at the Metropole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_750">750</span>
Hotel.<a id="FNanchor_A15-52" href="#Footnote_A15-52" class="fnanchor">A15-52</a> On November 17, 1959, she informed the Embassy of her
interview, and the information was recorded in a file memorandum.<a id="FNanchor_A15-53" href="#Footnote_A15-53" class="fnanchor">A15-53</a>
Oswald told Miss Johnson that he was scheduled to leave Moscow
within a few days. She thought that Oswald “may have purposely
not carried through his original intent to renounce [citizenship] in
order to leave a crack open.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-54" href="#Footnote_A15-54" class="fnanchor">A15-54</a> The Embassy accordingly informed
the Department of State about 2 weeks later that Oswald had
departed from the Hotel Metropole within the last few days.<a id="FNanchor_A15-55" href="#Footnote_A15-55" class="fnanchor">A15-55</a> According
to his “Historic Diary”<a id="FNanchor_A15-56" href="#Footnote_A15-56" class="fnanchor">A15-56</a> and other records available to the
Commission,<a id="FNanchor_A15-57" href="#Footnote_A15-57" class="fnanchor">A15-57</a> however, Oswald probably did not in fact leave
Moscow for Minsk until about January 4, 1960. Miss Johnson’s
report of her interview with Oswald was the last information about
him which the U.S. Government was to receive until February 13,
1961.<a id="FNanchor_A15-58" href="#Footnote_A15-58" class="fnanchor">A15-58</a></p>

<p>On March 6, 1960, Oswald’s mother asked Representative James C.
Wright, Jr., of Texas to help her locate her son. The Congressman
forwarded her inquiry to the Department of State, which in turn
sent it to the Embassy.<a id="FNanchor_A15-59" href="#Footnote_A15-59" class="fnanchor">A15-59</a> In response, the Embassy in Moscow informed
the Department on March 28, 1960, that they had had no contact
with Oswald since November 9, 1959.<a id="FNanchor_A15-60" href="#Footnote_A15-60" class="fnanchor">A15-60</a> The Embassy went on
to say that it had no evidence that Oswald had expatriated himself
“other than his announced intention to do so.” It believed, therefore,
that since Oswald was presumably still an American citizen, the
American Government could properly make inquiry concerning him
through a note to the Soviet Foreign Office. The Embassy went on
to suggest, however, that it would be preferable if Oswald’s mother
wrote a letter to her son which could then be forwarded by the
Department to the Soviet Government.<a id="FNanchor_A15-61" href="#Footnote_A15-61" class="fnanchor">A15-61</a></p>

<p>The Department replied on May 10, 1960, that no action should be
taken in the case other than on a request voluntarily submitted by a
member of Oswald’s family.<a id="FNanchor_A15-62" href="#Footnote_A15-62" class="fnanchor">A15-62</a> On June 22, a second communication
was dispatched, asking whether the Embassy had been able to contact
Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A15-63" href="#Footnote_A15-63" class="fnanchor">A15-63</a> On July 6, 1960, the Embassy replied that it had received
no further communication with anyone on the subject of Oswald and
that in view of the Department’s memorandum of May 10, 1960, it
intended to take no further action in the matter.<a id="FNanchor_A15-64" href="#Footnote_A15-64" class="fnanchor">A15-64</a> Mrs. Oswald apparently
took no steps to follow up on her original inquiry.</p>

<p>Under the procedures in effect in 1960, a “refusal sheet” was prepared
in the Department of State Passport Office whenever circumstances
created the possibility that a prospective applicant would not
be entitled to receive an American passport.<a id="FNanchor_A15-65" href="#Footnote_A15-65" class="fnanchor">A15-65</a> The records section of
the Passport Office, on the basis of the refusal sheet, would prepare
what was known as a lookout card<a id="FNanchor_A15-66" href="#Footnote_A15-66" class="fnanchor">A15-66</a> and file it in the lookout file in
the Passport Office. Whenever anyone applied for a passport from
any city in the world, his application was immediately forwarded to
this office, and his name and date of birth checked against the lookout
file.<a id="FNanchor_A15-67" href="#Footnote_A15-67" class="fnanchor">A15-67</a> If a lookout card was found, appropriate action, including the
possible refusal of a passport, was taken.<a id="FNanchor_A15-68" href="#Footnote_A15-68" class="fnanchor">A15-68</a> Passport Office procedures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_751">751</span>
also provided that the lookout card would be removed from a prospective
applicant’s file whenever facts warranted an unquestioned passport grant.<a id="FNanchor_A15-69" href="#Footnote_A15-69" class="fnanchor">A15-69</a></p>

<p>On March 25, 1960, the Passport Office had made up a “refusal
sheet” on Lee Harvey Oswald, typed across which was the explanation
that Oswald “may have been naturalized in the Soviet Union or
otherwise * * * expatriated himself.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-70" href="#Footnote_A15-70" class="fnanchor">A15-70</a> An Operations Memorandum
stating the reasons for which the card had been prepared was
drawn up on March 28 and also put on file<a id="FNanchor_A15-71" href="#Footnote_A15-71" class="fnanchor">A15-71</a> and a copy sent to the
Embassy. It advised the Embassy to take no further action on the
Oswald case unless it came into possession of evidence upon which to
base the preparation of a certificate of loss of nationality. Included
in the operations memorandum was the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An appropriate notice has been placed in the lookout card
section of the Passport Office in the event that Mr. Oswald should
apply for documentation at a post outside the Soviet Union.<a id="FNanchor_A15-72" href="#Footnote_A15-72" class="fnanchor">A15-72</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Despite these indications that a lookout card was prepared, the Department
of State on May 18, 1964, informed the Commission that “investigations,
to date, failed to reveal any other indication or evidence
that a lookout card was ever prepared, modified or removed.” No
such card was ever located, and certain file entries indicate that such
a card was never prepared.<a id="FNanchor_A15-73" href="#Footnote_A15-73" class="fnanchor">A15-73</a></p>

<p>The State Department has advised the Commission that as of October
1959 the Department had “developed information which might
reasonably have caused it to prepare * * * a lookout card for Lee
Harvey Oswald.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-74" href="#Footnote_A15-74" class="fnanchor">A15-74</a> The Passport Office employee who prepared the
refusal sheet for Oswald has suggested as a possible explanation of
the failure to prepare a lookout card that between the day she prepared
the refusal sheet and the time the records section would normally
have prepared the lookout card, Oswald’s file was temporarily pulled
from its place because the Department received some additional correspondence
from the Embassy. When the file was returned, she suggested,
it may have been assumed that the card had already been
prepared.<a id="FNanchor_A15-75" href="#Footnote_A15-75" class="fnanchor">A15-75</a></p>

<p>Had a lookout card been prepared on the ground of possible expatriation,
it would have been removed and destroyed after the decision
was made in 1961 that Oswald had not expatriated himself and
thus prior to the time that he applied for a second passport in June
1963. Hence, the Department’s apparent failure to prepare a lookout
card on Oswald had no effect on its future actions. As of February
20, 1964, the Department issued additional regulations regarding
the manner in which the lookout file is to be handled.<a id="FNanchor_A15-76" href="#Footnote_A15-76" class="fnanchor">A15-76</a> On March 14,
1964, a category was established for returned defectors, so that these
persons automatically have lookout cards in their files, and on July 27,
1964, the Office of Security of the Department of State issued a procedural
study of the lookout-card system, with recommendations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_752">752</span><a id="FNanchor_A15-77" href="#Footnote_A15-77" class="fnanchor">A15-77</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr253">RETURN AND RENEWAL OF OSWALD’S 1959 PASSPORT</h3>

<h4 id="hdr254">Negotiations Between Oswald and the Embassy</h4>

<p>On February 1, 1961, as a result of a visit by Oswald’s mother to
the Department of State on January 25, 1961,<a id="FNanchor_A15-78" href="#Footnote_A15-78" class="fnanchor">A15-78</a> the Department sent
a request to the Moscow Embassy as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Embassy is requested to inform the [Soviet] Ministry of
Foreign Affairs that Mr. Oswald’s mother is worried as to his
present safety, and is anxious to hear from him.<a id="FNanchor_A15-79" href="#Footnote_A15-79" class="fnanchor">A15-79</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The inquiry went to the Embassy by diplomatic pouch and was received
in Moscow on February 10 or 11.<a id="FNanchor_A15-80" href="#Footnote_A15-80" class="fnanchor">A15-80</a> On February 13, before the Embassy
had acted on the Department’s request,<a id="FNanchor_A15-81" href="#Footnote_A15-81" class="fnanchor">A15-81</a> the Embassy
received an undated letter from Oswald postmarked Minsk, February
5. The letter stated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Since I have not received a reply to my letter of December
1960, I am writing again asking that you consider my request
for the return of my American passport.</p>

<p>I desire to return to the United States, that is if we could come
to some agreement concerning the dropping of any legal proceedings
against me. If so, than I would be free to ask the Russian
authorities to allow me to leave. If I could show them my American
passport, I am of the opinion they would give me an exit
visa.</p>

<p>They have at no time insisted that I take Russian citizenship.
I am living here with non-permanent type papers for a foreigner.</p>

<p>I cannot leave Minsk without permission, therefore I am writing
rather than calling in person.</p>

<p>I hope that in recalling the responsibility I have to america
that you remember your’s in doing everything you can to help
me since I am an american citizen.<a id="FNanchor_A15-82" href="#Footnote_A15-82" class="fnanchor">A15-82</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Despite Oswald’s reference to his letter of December 1960, there is
no indication that he had written to the Embassy previously.<a id="FNanchor_A15-83" href="#Footnote_A15-83" class="fnanchor">A15-83</a> Furthermore,
his diary refers to his February 1 letter as his “first request”
concerning his return to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A15-84" href="#Footnote_A15-84" class="fnanchor">A15-84</a></p>

<p>On February 28, 1961, the Embassy wrote Oswald that he would
have to come to Moscow to discuss the passport and expatriation
matters.<a id="FNanchor_A15-85" href="#Footnote_A15-85" class="fnanchor">A15-85</a> Then on March 20, 1961, a second letter from Oswald,
dated March 12, was received by the Embassy. It read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In reply to your recent letter. I find it inconvenient to come
to Moscow for the sole purpose of an interview.</p>

<p>In my last letter I believe I stated that I cannot leave the city
of Minsk without permission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_753">753</span>
I believe there exist in the United States also a law in regards
to resident foreigners from Socialist countries, traveling between
cities.</p>

<p>I do not think it would be appropriate for me to request to leave
Minsk in order to visit the American Embassy. In any event,
the granting of permission is a long drawn out affair, and I find
that there is a hesitation on the part of local officials to even
start the process.</p>

<p>I have no intention of abusing my position here, and I am sure
you would not want me to.</p>

<p>I see no reasons for any preliminary inquires not to be put in
the form of a questionnaire and sent to me.</p>

<p>I understand that personal interviews undobtedly make to
work of the Embassy staff lighter, than written correspondence,
however, in some cases other means must be employed.<a id="FNanchor_A15-86" href="#Footnote_A15-86" class="fnanchor">A15-86</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After receiving the first letter postmarked February 5, the Embassy
on February 28 forwarded a despatch to the Department informing
it of Oswald’s letter and its reply to Oswald. At that time,
the Embassy also inquired of the Department whether Oswald would
be subject to prosecution on any grounds if he should return to the
United States and, if so, whether Oswald should be so informed. The
Department was also asked whether there was any objection to returning
Oswald’s 1959 passport to him by mail, since that might facilitate
his application for a Soviet exit visa.<a id="FNanchor_A15-87" href="#Footnote_A15-87" class="fnanchor">A15-87</a> Upon receiving Oswald’s
March 20 letter, the Embassy again consulted with Washington. The
Embassy proposed that it write Oswald repeating that he must come
to Moscow if he wanted to discuss reentering the United States and
pointing out that the Soviet government did not object to such visits
by American citizens.<a id="FNanchor_A15-88" href="#Footnote_A15-88" class="fnanchor">A15-88</a> Such a letter was mailed to Oswald on
March 24.<a id="FNanchor_A15-89" href="#Footnote_A15-89" class="fnanchor">A15-89</a></p>

<p>In the meantime, the State Department was considering the Embassy
despatch of February 28, 1961.<a id="FNanchor_A15-90" href="#Footnote_A15-90" class="fnanchor">A15-90</a> Although a different response
was originally recommended by a staff member in the Passport Office,<a id="FNanchor_A15-91" href="#Footnote_A15-91" class="fnanchor">A15-91</a>
the Department instructed the Embassy on April 13 that for security
reasons Oswald’s passport should be given to him only if he personally
appeared at the Embassy and that even then he was to receive the document
only after a full investigation had been made and the Embassy
was satisfied that he had not renounced his American citizenship.
Also, he was to present evidence that he had made arrangements to
depart from the Soviet Union to travel to the United States, and his
passport was to be stamped valid for direct return to the United States
only. The Department also told the Embassy that Oswald could not
be advised whether or not he would be prosecuted for any possible offenses
should he return to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A15-92" href="#Footnote_A15-92" class="fnanchor">A15-92</a> Matters remained in
this posture for over a month. During the interim, Oswald met and
married Marina Nikolaevna Prusakova.<a id="FNanchor_A15-93" href="#Footnote_A15-93" class="fnanchor">A15-93</a></p>

<p>On May 26, 1961, the Embassy sent a despatch to the Department<a id="FNanchor_A15-94" href="#Footnote_A15-94" class="fnanchor">A15-94</a>
advising that on May 25, 1961, it had received a letter from Oswald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_754">754</span>
postmarked Moscow, May 16, 1961.<a id="FNanchor_A15-95" href="#Footnote_A15-95" class="fnanchor">A15-95</a> In his latest letter Oswald said
he wanted “to make it clear” that he was asking for full guarantees
that he would not be prosecuted “under any circumstances” should he
return to the United States. Oswald went on to say that if the Embassy
could not give him these assurances, he would “endeavor to use
my relatives in the United States, to see about getting something done
in Washington.” He also informed the Embassy that he was married
to a Russian woman who would want to accompany him back to his
native country, and he once again repeated his reluctance to come to
Moscow. The Embassy suggested that it reply to Oswald by repeating
that the question of citizenship could only be made on the basis of a
personal interview, and by advising Oswald of the requirements and
procedures pertaining to his wife’s immigration. The despatch noted
that Oswald’s letter referred to his present Soviet internal passport in
which he claimed to be designated as “without citizenship,” and observed:
“It would appear on this basis that Oswald has not yet expatriated
himself under Section 349(a) (1) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act.” The Embassy inquired whether the Department
considered Oswald entitled “to the protection of the United States
Government while he continues to reside abroad under present circumstances
in the absence of reasonable evidence that he has committed an
expatriating act?”</p>

<p>The Department answered the despatch under date of July 11, 1961.
It said that it was not entirely clear what the description “without
citizenship” means, i.e., “whether he is without Soviet citizenship or
without any citizenship.” The instructions continued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In any event in the absence of evidence showing that Mr. Oswald
has definitely lost United States citizenship he apparently
maintains that technical status. Whether he is entitled to the
protection of the United States pending any further developments
concerning his precise status is a matter which will be left to
the Embassy’s discretion in the event an emergency situation
should arise. In a situation of this kind, not of an emergency
nature, the facts should be submitted to the Department.</p>

<p>It is noted that the Embassy intends to seek the Department’s
prior advice before granting Mr. Oswald documentation as a
United States citizen upon any application he may submit.</p>

<p>The Embassy’s careful attention to the involved case of Mr.
Oswald is appreciated * * *<a id="FNanchor_A15-96" href="#Footnote_A15-96" class="fnanchor">A15-96</a></p></blockquote>

<p>However, on Saturday, July 8, 1961, before the Embassy had received
the response from Washington, Oswald appeared without
warning at the Embassy in Moscow. Snyder came down to meet Oswald
after Oswald called him on the house telephone, and after a brief
talk, asked Oswald to return on Monday, July 10.<a id="FNanchor_A15-97" href="#Footnote_A15-97" class="fnanchor">A15-97</a> Later that day
Oswald telephoned his wife and told her to come to Moscow, which she
did the next day.<a id="FNanchor_A15-98" href="#Footnote_A15-98" class="fnanchor">A15-98</a> Oswald returned alone to the American Embassy
on Monday, where Snyder questioned him about his life in Russia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_755">755</span>
According to a memorandum which Snyder prepared shortly afterwards:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Twenty months of the realities of life in the Soviet Union have
clearly had a maturing effect on Oswald. He stated frankly that
he learned a hard lesson the hard way and that he had been
completely relieved about his illusions about the Soviet
Union * * * Much of the arrogance and bravado which characterized
him on his first visit to the Embassy appears to have left
him.<a id="FNanchor_A15-99" href="#Footnote_A15-99" class="fnanchor">A15-99</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Oswald told Snyder that despite the statement he had given him in
October 1959, he had never applied for Soviet citizenship, but only
for permission to reside in the Soviet Union. He presented his Soviet
internal passport, which described him as without citizenship of
any kind. Oswald said that he had been employed since January 13,
1960, as a metal worker in the research shop in the Byelorussian Radio
and Television Factory in Minsk. He claimed that he had taken no
oath of allegiance of any kind, and that he had not been required to
sign any papers in connection with this employment. He added that
he was not a member of the factory trade union organization. Oswald
said that he was earning 90 rubles ($90) a month and that
he had saved about 200 rubles ($200) toward travel expenses to the
United States. He denied that he had made any derogatory statements
concerning the United States to radio, press, or TV in the
Soviet Union, and he denied that he had turned over any information
to the Russians as he had threatened to do in the 1959 interview with
Snyder.<a id="FNanchor_A15-100" href="#Footnote_A15-100" class="fnanchor">A15-100</a></p>

<p>During the course of the interview Oswald filled out an application
for renewal of his American passport.<a id="FNanchor_A15-101" href="#Footnote_A15-101" class="fnanchor">A15-101</a> The renewal application was
required since Oswald’s existing passport would expire on September
10, 1961,<a id="FNanchor_A15-102" href="#Footnote_A15-102" class="fnanchor">A15-102</a> and it was extremely unlikely that he would be able to
obtain the requisite Soviet departure documents before that time. The
renewal application contained a printed statement which set forth, in
the disjunctive, a series of acts which, if committed by the applicant,
would either automatically disqualify him from receiving a passport
on the ground that he had lost his American citizenship, or would raise
a question whether he might be so disqualified. The printed statement
was preceded by two phrases, “have,” and, “have not,” the first phrase
being printed directly above the second. One carbon copy of the application
indicates Oswald signed the document after the second
phrase, “have not,” had been typed over, thereby apparently admitting
that he had committed one or more of the acts which would at least
raise a question as to whether he had expatriated himself. Snyder
was not able to remember with certainty to which of the acts listed on
the statement Oswald’s mark was intended to refer, but believed it
may have been to “swearing allegiance to a foreign state.” <a id="FNanchor_A15-103" href="#Footnote_A15-103" class="fnanchor">A15-103</a> He
points out that the strikeout of “have not” may also have been a clerical
error.<a id="FNanchor_A15-104" href="#Footnote_A15-104" class="fnanchor">A15-104</a> On the actual signed copy of the application kept in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_756">756</span>
files of the Moscow Embassy, which is not a carbon copy of the copy
sent to the Department, the strikeout is slightly above the “have;”
therefore, since the “have” is itself printed above the “have not,” the
strikeout may have been intended to obliterate the “have.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-105" href="#Footnote_A15-105" class="fnanchor">A15-105</a></p>

<p>In any event, Oswald filled out the supplementary questionnaire
which was required to be completed if the applicant admitted he had
performed one or more of the possibly expatriating acts. He signed
the questionnaire under oath.<a id="FNanchor_A15-106" href="#Footnote_A15-106" class="fnanchor">A15-106</a> Snyder testified that it was routine
for any kind of “problem case” to fill out the supplementary questionnaire.<a id="FNanchor_A15-107" href="#Footnote_A15-107" class="fnanchor">A15-107</a>
The Passport Office employee who processed the Oswald
case in Washington testified that she routinely regarded the questionnaire
rather than the application itself as the controlling document
for expatriation purposes, so that she probably paid no attention
to the strikeout.<a id="FNanchor_A15-108" href="#Footnote_A15-108" class="fnanchor">A15-108</a></p>

<p>The pertinent questions included on the questionnaire, with Oswald’s
answers, read as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>2. (a) Are you known or considered in your community to be a
national of the country in which you are residing? <i>No.</i>
(Yes or No)</p>

<p><span class="in1">(b)</span> If your answer to 2(a) is “No,” explain why not.
<i>On my document for residence in the USSR my nationality

<p>3. (a) Have you ever sought or obtained registration as a national
of a foreign country, applied for or obtained a passport,

which you were described as a national of a country other
than the United States? <i>No.</i> (Yes or No)</p>

<p><span class="in1">(b)</span> If your answer to 3(a) is “Yes,” did you voluntarily seek
or claim such benefits? (Yes or No) If “No,” please
explain.</p>

<p><i><span class="in2">  I</span> recived a document for residence in the USSR but I am
described as being “Without citizenship.”</i></p>

<p>4. (a) Have you ever informed any local or national official of a
foreign state that you are a national of the United States?
<i>No.</i> * * *</p>

<p><span class="in1">(b)</span> If your answer to 4(a) is “No,” explain why not. <i>On my
document for residence in the USSR, my nationality is

other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state?
<i>No.</i> * * *</p>

<p>8. Have you ever accepted, served in, or performed the duties
of any office, post or employment under the government of
a foreign state or political subdivision thereof? <i>No.</i> * * *<br />

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_757">757</span>
On the basis of these answers, and on the basis of the statements
Oswald made orally during the interview, Snyder concluded that
Oswald had not lost his citizenship. Snyder therefore handed him
back his passport. Pursuant to the instructions from Washington, it
was stamped, “This passport is valid only for direct travel to the
United States.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-110" href="#Footnote_A15-110" class="fnanchor">A15-110</a></p>

<p>In a despatch dated July 11, 1961,<a id="FNanchor_A15-111" href="#Footnote_A15-111" class="fnanchor">A15-111</a> the Embassy informed the
Department of State of its conclusion that Oswald had not lost his
American citizenship and requested that, if Washington agreed with
the conclusion, “the Embassy be authorized to renew Oswald’s passport
at its discretion.” The despatch, with which Oswald’s application
and supplemental questionnaire<a id="FNanchor_A15-112" href="#Footnote_A15-112" class="fnanchor">A15-112</a> were enclosed, informed the Department
that Oswald was questioned at length at the Embassy and
that no evidence was revealed of any act which might be considered
as having caused the loss of his American citizenship.</p>

<p>The Embassy added in the <span class="locked">despatch—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is our intention not to renew it [the passport] without the
Department’s prior approval of the enclosed renewal application,
and then only upon evidence of a present need for the renewal in
connection with his efforts to return to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A15-113" href="#Footnote_A15-113" class="fnanchor">A15-113</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Oswald appeared at the Embassy once again on July 11, 1961, this
time accompanied by Marina, in order to complete the papers necessary
to obtain permission for his wife to enter the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A15-114" href="#Footnote_A15-114" class="fnanchor">A15-114</a>
In a letter dated July 16, 1961, Oswald informed the American
Embassy about his and Marina’s application to the Soviet officials for
permission to leave Russia, and described the harassment which
Marina was allegedly undergoing because of her attempts to leave
the country.<a id="FNanchor_A15-115" href="#Footnote_A15-115" class="fnanchor">A15-115</a></p>

<p>Based upon Snyder’s recommendation and the information in its
files, the Passport Office on August 18, 1961, concluded that Oswald
had not expatriated himself.<a id="FNanchor_A15-116" href="#Footnote_A15-116" class="fnanchor">A15-116</a> Therefore, on that date, the Department
of State sent a despatch to the Embassy in Moscow stating that
they concurred in the Embassy’s recommendation of July 11, 1961,
with respect to Oswald’s citizenship:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We concur in the conclusion of the Embassy that there is available
no information and/or evidence to show that Mr. Oswald has
expatriated himself under the pertinent laws of the United States.</p>

<p>The renewal of Mr. Oswald’s passport, issued on September 10,
1959, is authorized upon his referenced application if no adverse
reason is known, to take place upon his presentation of evidence
that he needs such renewal in connection with his efforts to
return to the United States as indicated in the final sentence on
page 2 of Despatch 29. As requested in the final paragraph of
the Despatch the Embassy may perform this citizenship function
for Mr. Oswald at its discretion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_758">758</span>
Any passport renewal granted to Mr. Oswald should be
limited to his passport needs and, as stated in the second paragraph
of the Department’s A-173, April 13, 1961 his passport
should be made valid for direct return to the United States. The
additional precaution set forth in the same paragraph should be
observed and his passport should be delivered to him on a personal
basis only. When available, a report of his travel data
should be submitted, as well as a report of any intervening
developments.<a id="FNanchor_A15-117" href="#Footnote_A15-117" class="fnanchor">A15-117</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On October 12, 1961, the Embassy wrote the Department to inform
it of four letters it had received from Oswald dated July 15, August 8,
and October 4, and an undated letter received in August. With reference
to these letters, the despatch noted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * that Oswald is having difficulty in obtaining exit visas for
himself and his Soviet wife, and that they are subject to increasing
harassment in Minsk. In replying to Oswald’s latest letter, the
Embassy pointed out that it has no way of influencing Soviet
action on exit visas. It informed him that the question of his
passport renewal could be discussed with him personally at the
Embassy. In answer to Oswald’s question, the Embassy notified
him that the petition to classify his wife’s status had not yet
been approved.<a id="FNanchor_A15-118" href="#Footnote_A15-118" class="fnanchor">A15-118</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The Department on December 28, 1961, informed the Embassy that
the Passport Office approved the manner of the Embassy’s reply to
Mr. Oswald with respect “to his receiving further passport facilities.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-119" href="#Footnote_A15-119" class="fnanchor">A15-119</a>
After a further exchange of correspondence between Oswald
and the Embassy, dealing primarily with Oswald’s difficulties
in obtaining the necessary Soviet clearance, his impatience in receiving
American approval for Marina’s entry into the United States, and
his efforts to obtain a repatriation loan,<a id="FNanchor_A15-120" href="#Footnote_A15-120" class="fnanchor">A15-120</a> the passport problem was
finally concluded on May 24, 1962, when the Embassy renewed Oswald’s
passport for 30 days, stamped it valid for direct return to the
United States only and handed it to him.<a id="FNanchor_A15-121" href="#Footnote_A15-121" class="fnanchor">A15-121</a> A week later he used it
to return to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A15-122" href="#Footnote_A15-122" class="fnanchor">A15-122</a></p>

<p>The decision that Oswald was entitled to a new passport because
he had not expatriated himself was made for the Embassy by the consul,
Richard E. Snyder.<a id="FNanchor_A15-123" href="#Footnote_A15-123" class="fnanchor">A15-123</a> For the Department it was made initially
by Miss Bernice L. Waterman, a worker in the Passport Office for 36
years, and was then approved by her area chief, by the head of the
Foreign Operations Division, and by the Legal Division of the Passport
Office.<a id="FNanchor_A15-124" href="#Footnote_A15-124" class="fnanchor">A15-124</a> Snyder and Miss Waterman have both testified that
they reached their decisions independently and without influence from
any other person.<a id="FNanchor_A15-125" href="#Footnote_A15-125" class="fnanchor">A15-125</a> The Director of the Passport Office and the Legal
Adviser to the State Department both stated that after a review of the

that Snyder and Waterman, therefore, acted correctly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_759">759</span><a id="FNanchor_A15-126" href="#Footnote_A15-126" class="fnanchor">A15-126</a></p>

<p>Since he was born in the United States, Oswald was an American
citizen.<a id="FNanchor_A15-127" href="#Footnote_A15-127" class="fnanchor">A15-127</a> However, Congress has provided that by performing certain
acts, a person may forfeit his American citizenship. Thus
Oswald would have become expatriated while in Russia if he obtained
naturalization in the Soviet Union, renounced U.S. nationality, took
an oath of allegiance to the Soviet Union, or voluntarily worked for
the Soviet Government in a post requiring that the employee take
an oath of allegiance.</p>

<p><i>Naturalization in a foreign state.</i>—Section 349(a)(1) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act of 1952 provides that a U.S. citizen
shall lose his nationality by “obtaining naturalization in a foreign
state upon his own application * * *.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-128" href="#Footnote_A15-128" class="fnanchor">A15-128</a> Although Oswald applied
for Soviet citizenship, he never received it.<a id="FNanchor_A15-129" href="#Footnote_A15-129" class="fnanchor">A15-129</a> Thus, Oswald did not
expatriate himself under section 349(a)(1).</p>

<p><i>Formal renunciation of U.S. nationality.</i>—Section 349(a)(6) of the
act provides that a U.S. citizen shall lose his citizenship by:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * making a formal renunciation of nationality before a diplomatic
or consular officer of the United States in a foreign state,
in such form as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State.<a id="FNanchor_A15-130" href="#Footnote_A15-130" class="fnanchor">A15-130</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In accordance with this statute, the Secretary has promulgated regulations
prescribing the manner in which renunciation is to be effected.<a id="FNanchor_A15-131" href="#Footnote_A15-131" class="fnanchor">A15-131</a>
The regulations provide, among other things, that 4
copies of the renunciation form are to be executed and the original
and one copy sent to the Department. The Department must then
approve the form and advise the appropriate consular official, who
may then furnish a copy of the form to the person to whom it relates.
The form itself requires the person to subscribe it in the presence of
a consular official, and it must also be signed by this official.<a id="FNanchor_A15-132" href="#Footnote_A15-132" class="fnanchor">A15-132</a></p>

<p>Though in 1959 Oswald clearly stated to officials at the American
Embassy, both orally and in writing, that he desired to renounce his
U.S. citizenship, he at no time took the steps required by the statute
and regulations to effect his renunciation. Oswald did not execute
the proper forms, he did not sign his letter of October 31 or November 3, 1959,
in the presence of a consular official, and neither letter
was signed by such an official.<a id="FNanchor_A15-133" href="#Footnote_A15-133" class="fnanchor">A15-133</a> Because section 349(a)(6) in terms
requires compliance with the form prescribed by the Secretary of
State, Oswald did not expatriate himself under that section.</p>

<p><i>Oath of allegiance to a foreign state.</i>—Section 349(a)(2) of the
act provides that a U.S. citizen shall lose his nationality by:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal
declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or a political subdivision
thereof.<a id="FNanchor_A15-134" href="#Footnote_A15-134" class="fnanchor">A15-134</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_760">760</span>
In his letter of October 31, 1959, Oswald wrote: “I affirm that my
allegiance is to the union of Soviet Socialist Republics.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-135" href="#Footnote_A15-135" class="fnanchor">A15-135</a> Both in
this letter and in his letter of November 3, 1959, he stated that his
application for citizenship in the Soviet Union was pending before the
Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.<a id="FNanchor_A15-136" href="#Footnote_A15-136" class="fnanchor">A15-136</a></p>

<p>Oswald’s letters no doubt were intended to express allegiance to the
Soviet Union in a manner inconsistent with continued allegiance to
the United States, as the statute has been held to require.<a id="FNanchor_A15-137" href="#Footnote_A15-137" class="fnanchor">A15-137</a> However,
since 1940, it has been well established that in order for an oath of
allegiance to a foreign state to work an expatriation from the United
States, it must be given to an official of the foreign state, and not to
a party unconnected with the foreign state.<a id="FNanchor_A15-138" href="#Footnote_A15-138" class="fnanchor">A15-138</a> This requirement can
be viewed as a necessary corollary of the broader, but less clearly
established, principle that the oath must be taken in accord with the
requirements of the foreign state.<a id="FNanchor_A15-139" href="#Footnote_A15-139" class="fnanchor">A15-139</a> Although Lee Harvey Oswald
wrote that his allegiance was to the Soviet Union,<a id="FNanchor_A15-140" href="#Footnote_A15-140" class="fnanchor">A15-140</a> there is no indication
that he had ever actually taken an oath or declaration or that
any such oath was taken before an official of the Soviet Government.
He, therefore, did not expatriate himself under section 349(a)(2).</p>

<p><i>Employment under the government of a foreign state.</i>—Section
349(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 provides
that a U.S. citizen shall lose his nationality by:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(a) accepting, serving in, or performing the duties of any office,
post, or employment under the government of a foreign state or a
political subdivision thereof, if he has or acquires the nationality
of such foreign state; or (b) accepting, serving in, or performing
the duties of any office, post of employment under the government
of a foreign state or a political subdivision thereof, for which
office, post, or employment an oath, affirmation, or declaration of
allegiance is required. * * *<a id="FNanchor_A15-141" href="#Footnote_A15-141" class="fnanchor">A15-141</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">While Oswald was employed in a state-owned factory in Minsk, he
did not acquire Russian nationality, and there is no indication that he
had to take any oath when he obtained this employment.<a id="FNanchor_A15-142" href="#Footnote_A15-142" class="fnanchor">A15-142</a> Furthermore,
prior judicial decisions indicate that merely working in a government-owned
factory does not result in expatriation even if an oath
was required to be taken in connection with such employment.<a id="FNanchor_A15-143" href="#Footnote_A15-143" class="fnanchor">A15-143</a> Several
cases decided under an earlier but similar statutory provision held
that where a person took a government job in order to subsist, such
employment was considered involuntary since it was based on economic
duress, and thus it did not result in expatriation.<a id="FNanchor_A15-144" href="#Footnote_A15-144" class="fnanchor">A15-144</a> Thus, Oswald
did not expatriate himself under section 349(a)(4).</p>

<p>The Commission therefore concludes that Lee Harvey Oswald had
not expatriated himself by any acts performed between October 16,
1959, and May 1962, and concurs in the opinion of the State Department
that his passport was properly returned to him in July 1961 and
properly reissued in May 1962.</p>

<h3 id="hdr256">AUTHORIZATION FOR MARINA OSWALD TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES</h3>

<h4 id="hdr257">Negotiations Between Oswald and the Embassy</h4>

<p>On July 11, 1961, Oswald and his wife appeared at the Embassy in
Moscow before John A. McVickar.<a id="FNanchor_A15-145" href="#Footnote_A15-145" class="fnanchor">A15-145</a> Together they executed papers
to set in motion the procedures for her admittance to the United States
as a nonquota immigrant under the provisions applicable to the wife
of an American citizen.<a id="FNanchor_A15-146" href="#Footnote_A15-146" class="fnanchor">A15-146</a> The interview was routine. McVickar
asked Marina whether she was a member of any Communist organization
and she replied that she was a member of the Trade Union of
Medical Workers<a id="FNanchor_A15-147" href="#Footnote_A15-147" class="fnanchor">A15-147</a> but she denied she was or ever had been a member
of the Komsomol,<a id="FNanchor_A15-148" href="#Footnote_A15-148" class="fnanchor">A15-148</a> the Communist youth organization, or any other
Communist organization.<a id="FNanchor_A15-149" href="#Footnote_A15-149" class="fnanchor">A15-149</a> Marina Oswald has since admitted to the
Commission that at one time she was a member of The Komsomol, but
was expelled, according to her testimony, when it was learned that she
intended to accompany her husband to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A15-150" href="#Footnote_A15-150" class="fnanchor">A15-150</a> The Embassy
forwarded the papers pertaining to her application to the State
Department on August 28, 1961.<a id="FNanchor_A15-151" href="#Footnote_A15-151" class="fnanchor">A15-151</a></p>

<p>Marina Oswald’s ability to obtain a nonquota immigrant visa depended
on the favorable resolution of 3 questions. First, it had to
be determined that she was the wife of an American citizen,<a id="FNanchor_A15-152" href="#Footnote_A15-152" class="fnanchor">A15-152</a> which
depended on whether her husband had expatriated himself. Second,
it was necessary to determine that she was not and had not been affiliated
with a Communist organization on other than an involuntary
basis.<a id="FNanchor_A15-153" href="#Footnote_A15-153" class="fnanchor">A15-153</a> Third, it had to be determined that she was not likely to
become a public charge after she was admitted to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A15-154" href="#Footnote_A15-154" class="fnanchor">A15-154</a>
Section 243(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act<a id="FNanchor_A15-155" href="#Footnote_A15-155" class="fnanchor">A15-155</a> presented
a fourth issue. This section of the act prohibits the issuance of immigrant
visas by American Consuls stationed in countries which have
refused to accept or have unduly delayed accepting the return of persons
sought to be deported from the United States. The Soviet
Union had been designated as such a country in 1953. However, the
sanctions of section 243(g) are often waived; and even if they were not
waived in Marina’s case, she could obtain her visa at an American Embassy
in some other country on her way from the Soviet Union to the
United States, if she were otherwise entitled to the visa.<a id="FNanchor_A15-156" href="#Footnote_A15-156" class="fnanchor">A15-156</a></p>

<p>In a despatch dated August 28, 1961, the Embassy requested from
the Department a security advisory opinion on Marina Oswald’s application
to enter the United States. The Embassy wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A favorable advisory opinion and approval of * * * [Mrs.
Oswald’s] petition is recommended together with a waiver of the
sanctions imposed by section 243(g) of the Act. * * *</p>

<p>In connection with her employment and her professional training,
she has been a member of the Soviet Trade Union for Medical
Workers since 1957. Such membership is routinely considered
to be involuntary. * * *<a id="FNanchor_A15-157" href="#Footnote_A15-157" class="fnanchor">A15-157</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_762">762</span>
The Department initiated a check on Marina Oswald with the CIA,
the FBI, the Department’s own Office of Security, and Passport Office.<a id="FNanchor_A15-158" href="#Footnote_A15-158" class="fnanchor">A15-158</a>
The security check turned up no derogatory information on
her, so that in early October 1961 the Department cabled Moscow that
the available information concerning the applicant established her
eligibility to enter the country as a nonquota immigrant.<a id="FNanchor_A15-159" href="#Footnote_A15-159" class="fnanchor">A15-159</a></p>

<p>The Department’s decision assumed that prior to obtaining her visa
to enter the United States, Marina Oswald would provide some reasonable
assurance that she was not likely to become a public charge after
she had arrived there. The Department later encountered some difficulty
in deciding that she had met this requirement. She knew no
one in the United States other than the members of her husband’s
family, and they lacked the means to furnish any substantial financial
guarantees. After considerable correspondence on the matter with
Oswald<a id="FNanchor_A15-160" href="#Footnote_A15-160" class="fnanchor">A15-160</a> and with the Department,<a id="FNanchor_A15-161" href="#Footnote_A15-161" class="fnanchor">A15-161</a> the Embassy decided to accept
Oswald’s own affidavit to support his wife as sufficient assurance
that she would not become a public charge. The Embassy’s reasons
were set forth in a memorandum dated March 16, 1962:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It appears that * * * [Oswald] can find no one in the United
States who is able and willing to execute an affidavit of support
for his wife. Furthermore, Oswald has been able to obtain no
concrete offer of employment in the United States. On the other
hand, he is trained in a trade which should make him readily
employable and he and his family will be able to live with his
mother in Texas until he has found work and become otherwise
settled. Taking into consideration the latter factors, Oswald’s
legal obligation to support his wife, and the unusual circumstances
of the case which make it difficult for Oswald to provide the usual
financial evidence, the responsible consular officer * * * [is] willing
to accept Oswald’s unsubstantiated affidavit as sufficient to
overcome the public charge provisions of the law.<a id="FNanchor_A15-162" href="#Footnote_A15-162" class="fnanchor">A15-162</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The necessity of relying solely upon Oswald’s own affidavit, however,
was eliminated somewhat later when the Department received an
affidavit of support from the employer of Oswald’s mother in Vernon,
Tex.<a id="FNanchor_A15-163" href="#Footnote_A15-163" class="fnanchor">A15-163</a></p>

<p>By law the Attorney General must also pass upon an applicant’s
eligibility, and this responsibility has been delegated to the District
Directors of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.<a id="FNanchor_A15-164" href="#Footnote_A15-164" class="fnanchor">A15-164</a> The
machinery to get approval of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service for Marina Oswald’s admission to the United States was set
in motion on October 6, 1961. On that date the Visa Office of the
Department of State sent a letter to the District Director of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service in Dallas, Tex., requesting the
Service to take action on her immigrant visa.<a id="FNanchor_A15-165" href="#Footnote_A15-165" class="fnanchor">A15-165</a> The letter transmitted
her marriage certificate, a check for $10 from Lee Harvey
Oswald, and a “Petition to Classify Status of Alien For Issuance of
Immigrant Visa.” The petition was signed by Oswald and was on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_763">763</span>
behalf of Marina, asking that she be classified in “the status of the
alien beneficiary for issuance of an immigrant visa as * * * the spouse
of a United States citizen.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-166" href="#Footnote_A15-166" class="fnanchor">A15-166</a> The letter from the Visa Office stated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Oswald has been the object of an investigation by the Department
and has been found, in the Department’s opinion, not ineligible
to secure a visa.<a id="FNanchor_A15-167" href="#Footnote_A15-167" class="fnanchor">A15-167</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On the basis of this communication, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service at its Dallas, Tex., office instituted a field investigation
on Lee Harvey Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A15-168" href="#Footnote_A15-168" class="fnanchor">A15-168</a> Routine checks with the Federal Security
agencies and with local law enforcement authorities turned up no
new derogatory information, and no evidence was uncovered that
Oswald was ever a member of the Communist Party or other subversive
groups.<a id="FNanchor_A15-169" href="#Footnote_A15-169" class="fnanchor">A15-169</a> A record check was made in New Orleans, La.,
and a birth certificate was found for Lee Harvey Oswald, proving
that he was an American citizen by birth.<a id="FNanchor_A15-170" href="#Footnote_A15-170" class="fnanchor">A15-170</a> On October 17, 1961,
an investigator from the Dallas office interviewed Oswald’s brother,
Robert, who expressed the view that Lee was just a “mixed up kid”
who had emigrated to Russia because he had become embittered,
possibly over something that had happened while he was in the
Marine Corps.<a id="FNanchor_A15-171" href="#Footnote_A15-171" class="fnanchor">A15-171</a></p>

<p>On January 25, 1962, the results of the field investigation in Dallas
were consolidated in a report<a id="FNanchor_A15-172" href="#Footnote_A15-172" class="fnanchor">A15-172</a> which, with a covering memorandum,<a id="FNanchor_A15-173" href="#Footnote_A15-173" class="fnanchor">A15-173</a>
was sent to the District Director of the Service in San Antonio
the next day. The accompanying memorandum noted that the immigrant
inspector who processed the case had endorsed it “approved,”
but the author of the memorandum overruled the decision of the
inspector on the grounds that the sanctions under section 243(g)
should not be waived.<a id="FNanchor_A15-174" href="#Footnote_A15-174" class="fnanchor">A15-174</a> The reasons for denying the waiver were
stated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>OI [Operations Instructions] 205.3, as you know, provides that
the District Director may waive sanctions in an individual meritorious
case for a beneficiary of a petition filed by a reputable
relative where no substantial derogatory security information
is developed. I am of the opinion that both of these restrictions
are present in this case.<a id="FNanchor_A15-175" href="#Footnote_A15-175" class="fnanchor">A15-175</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">On January 30, 1962, the District Director at San Antonio affirmed
the decision of the Dallas office, including the decision that the sanctions
imposed under section 243(g) not be waived.<a id="FNanchor_A15-176" href="#Footnote_A15-176" class="fnanchor">A15-176</a> He concluded
that Oswald’s recent statements to the American Embassy in Moscow
to the effect that he had learned from his experiences in Russia were
not sufficient to relieve the doubts which were raised regarding his
loyalty to the United States by the arrogant, anti-American statements
he made when he entered Russia in 1959.<a id="FNanchor_A15-177" href="#Footnote_A15-177" class="fnanchor">A15-177</a></p>

<p>San Antonio forwarded its decision to Washington in a letter dated
January 31, 1962, in which Marina Oswald’s petition and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_764">764</span>
aforementioned memoranda and reports were included.<a id="FNanchor_A15-178" href="#Footnote_A15-178" class="fnanchor">A15-178</a> However,
because Washington had previously indicated its impatience at
not yet having received anything on the Oswald case, the San Antonio
office also telegraphed its decision to Washington about a week later,<a id="FNanchor_A15-179" href="#Footnote_A15-179" class="fnanchor">A15-179</a>
the telegram, presumably being received by Washington before the
letter of January 31. The Washington copy of this telegram has a
handwritten note on the lower portion which indicates that on February
12 an officer in the Visa Office of the State Department informed the
Immigration and Naturalization Service by telephone: “Political
desk of opinion, we’re better off with subject in U.S. than in Russia.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-180" href="#Footnote_A15-180" class="fnanchor">A15-180</a></p>

<p>Nonetheless, the Washington office of the Service concurred in the
field decision that the provisions of section 243(g) should not be
waived.<a id="FNanchor_A15-181" href="#Footnote_A15-181" class="fnanchor">A15-181</a> However, the Washington office pointed out that the correct
disposition should be not to deny the visa petition as the field
offices had proposed, but to grant the petition and indorse it to read,
“Waiver of sanctions imposed under section 243(g) of the Act is not
authorized.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-182" href="#Footnote_A15-182" class="fnanchor">A15-182</a></p>

<p>On February 28, 1962, the Dallas office of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service notified the Department of State in Washington
and the American Embassy in Moscow of this disposition. The communication
from the Dallas office noted that Oswald “has been notified
at his Minsk, Russia, address of the approval of the petition in his
wife’s behalf.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-183" href="#Footnote_A15-183" class="fnanchor">A15-183</a> Oswald later told the Embassy that he had received
the notice on March 15.<a id="FNanchor_A15-184" href="#Footnote_A15-184" class="fnanchor">A15-184</a> On March 9, 1962, the Department of State
also notified the Embassy in Moscow that Oswald’s wife was entitled
to nonquota status but that the Immigration and Naturalization Service
would not waive section 243(g) of the Act. The Embassy was told
to inform Oswald of this fact if he asked about it. The memorandum
indicated that the Embassy might suggest that Marina could proceed
to some other country to file her visa application and thus avoid the
sanction.<a id="FNanchor_A15-185" href="#Footnote_A15-185" class="fnanchor">A15-185</a></p>

<p>The Moscow Embassy on March 16, 1962, asked the Embassy at
Brussels if Mrs. Oswald could obtain her visa in Brussels.<a id="FNanchor_A15-186" href="#Footnote_A15-186" class="fnanchor">A15-186</a> The
Brussels Embassy replied affirmatively and said a visa could be issued
to Marina within 2 or 3 days of her arrival.<a id="FNanchor_A15-187" href="#Footnote_A15-187" class="fnanchor">A15-187</a> The Marina Oswald
file accordingly was sent to the Embassy at Brussels.<a id="FNanchor_A15-188" href="#Footnote_A15-188" class="fnanchor">A15-188</a></p>

<p>The plan to obtain the visa in Belgium was rendered unnecessary,
however, when the Immigration and Naturalization Service reversed
its position regarding the waiver of section 243(g). On March 16,
the Soviet desk at the Department of State took initial action to
attempt to secure such a change by sending a memorandum to the
Visa Office within the Department, urging that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service be asked to reconsider its decision.<a id="FNanchor_A15-189" href="#Footnote_A15-189" class="fnanchor">A15-189</a> According
to this memorandum:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>SOV believes it is in the interest of the U.S. to get Lee Harvey
Oswald and his family out of the Soviet Union and on their way
to this country as soon as possible. An unstable character, whose
actions are entirely unpredictable, Oswald may well refuse to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_765">765</span>
leave the USSR or subsequently attempt to return there if we
should make it impossible for him to be accompanied from Moscow
by his wife and child.</p>

<p>Such action on our part also would permit the Soviet Government to
argue that, although it had issued an exit visa to Mrs.
Oswald to prevent the separation of a family, the United States
Government had imposed a forced separation by refusing to issue
her a visa. Obviously, this would weaken our Embassy’s position
in encouraging positive Soviet action in other cases involving
Soviet citizen relatives of U.S. citizens.<a id="FNanchor_A15-190" href="#Footnote_A15-190" class="fnanchor">A15-190</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Soon thereafter, however, the Department of State notified its
Moscow Embassy that the decision was under review and instructed
it to withhold action pending the outcome of the reconsideration.<a id="FNanchor_A15-191" href="#Footnote_A15-191" class="fnanchor">A15-191</a></p>

<p>The Visa Office first contacted the Washington office of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service informally, and was advised, according
to a contemporaneous notation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * that case had been carefully considered and decision made
at Assistant or Deputy Associate Commissioner level. Therefore,
although not wishing to comment on likelihood of reversal, [INS
officer] felt that any letter requesting a review of the case should
come from the Director or Acting Administrator.<a id="FNanchor_A15-192" href="#Footnote_A15-192" class="fnanchor">A15-192</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">On March 27, 1962, such a letter was written from an acting administrator
in the Department of State to the Commissioner of Immigration
and Naturalization. The letter read in part:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I appreciate the difficulty this case presents for your Service,
because of Mr. Oswald’s background, and the fact that granting
a waiver of the sanction makes it appear that this Government is
assisting a person who is not altogether entitled to such assistance.
However, if the Embassy at Moscow is unable to issue Mrs. Oswald
a visa, it would appear that she and indirectly the Oswalds’ newborn
child are being punished for Mr. Oswald’s earlier indiscretions.
I might also point out that this Government has advanced
Mr. Oswald a loan of $500.00 for repatriation.</p>

<p>More important, however, is the possibility that if Mrs. Oswald
is not issued a visa by the Embassy, the Soviet Government will
be in a position to claim that it has done all it can to prevent the
separation of the family by issuing Mrs. Oswald the required exit
permission, but that this Government has refused to issue her a
visa, thus preventing her from accompanying her husband and
child. This would weaken the Embassy’s attempts to encourage
positive action by the Soviet authorities in other cases involving
Soviet relatives of United States citizens.</p>

<p>Because of these considerations and because I believe it is in
the best interests of the United States to have Mr. Oswald depart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_766">766</span>
from the Soviet Union as soon as possible, I request that the section
243(g) sanction be waived in Mrs. Oswald’s case.<a id="FNanchor_A15-193" href="#Footnote_A15-193" class="fnanchor">A15-193</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The Immigration and Naturalization Service ultimately reversed its
original position and granted the waiver on May 9, 1962. The letter
reversing its initial decision states that the matter has been “carefully
reviewed in this office” and that “in view of the strong representations”
made in the letter of March 27, the sanctions imposed pursuant to
section 243(g) were thereby waived in behalf of Mrs. Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A15-194" href="#Footnote_A15-194" class="fnanchor">A15-194</a></p>

<p>Actually, the Office of Soviet Affairs had informally learned on
May 8 that the May 9 letter would be signed by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.<a id="FNanchor_A15-195" href="#Footnote_A15-195" class="fnanchor">A15-195</a> On the strength of the assurance that a
written reversal would be forthcoming immediately, the State Department
quickly telegraphed the Moscow Embassy reporting that the
waiver had been granted.<a id="FNanchor_A15-196" href="#Footnote_A15-196" class="fnanchor">A15-196</a> Marina Oswald completed her processing
when she, her husband, and daughter came to Moscow in May
1962 on their way from Minsk to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A15-197" href="#Footnote_A15-197" class="fnanchor">A15-197</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr258">Legal Justification for the Decisions Affecting Marina Oswald</h4>

<p><i>Wife of a citizen of the United States.</i>—Section 205 of the Immigration
and Nationality Act of 1952 provides for the admission into
the United States of persons married to American citizens.<a id="FNanchor_A15-198" href="#Footnote_A15-198" class="fnanchor">A15-198</a> Once
it was determined that Lee Harvey Oswald was born in the United
States<a id="FNanchor_A15-199" href="#Footnote_A15-199" class="fnanchor">A15-199</a> and had not expatriated himself, his American citizenship
was established. Marina Oswald submitted a marriage certificate to
show that she was his wife.<a id="FNanchor_A15-200" href="#Footnote_A15-200" class="fnanchor">A15-200</a> This requirement was, therefore,
satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Assurance that Marina Oswald would not become a public charge.</i>—Section
212(a)(15) of the act provides that aliens will not be admitted
to the United States if, in the opinion of the responsible Government
official, they “are likely at any time to become public charges.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-201" href="#Footnote_A15-201" class="fnanchor">A15-201</a> The
pertinent Department of State regulations provide that a determination
to exclude an alien for this reason must be “predicated upon circumstances
which indicate that the alien will probably become a charge
upon the public after entry into the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-202" href="#Footnote_A15-202" class="fnanchor">A15-202</a></p>

<p>In 1962, Oswald was 22 years old and in good health. He had lived
in the United States for 17 years before joining the Marine Corps
and was, therefore, familiar with its language and customs. He had
gained job experience by working 2½ years in a factory which produced
electronic equipment. Under these circumstances the Department
was not unreasonable in concluding that Oswald’s own affidavit
that he would support his wife was sufficient assurance that she was
not likely to become a charge upon the public after her entry into the
United States. The receipt of the affidavit from Marguerite Oswald’s
employer provided a possible alternative basis for reaching this decision,
but since a favorable ruling had already been made on the basis
of Oswald’s affidavit, the Embassy had no reason to consider the sufficiency
of the second affidavit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_767">767</span>
<i>Membership in a Communist organization.</i>—Under section 212(a)
(28) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, an alien will not be
admitted to the United States if he is or was a member of, or affiliated
with, a Communist organization unless:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">* * * such an alien establishes to the satisfaction of the consular
officer when applying for a visa and the consular officer finds that
(i) such membership or application is or was involuntary, or is or
was solely when under sixteen years of age, by operation of law,
or for purposes of obtaining employment, food rations, or other
essentials of living and where necessary for such purposes
* * *<a id="FNanchor_A15-203" href="#Footnote_A15-203" class="fnanchor">A15-203</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At the time Marina Oswald applied for a visa she was a member
of the Soviet Trade Union for Medical Workers.<a id="FNanchor_A15-204" href="#Footnote_A15-204" class="fnanchor">A15-204</a> According to the
Department of State, the</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0"> * * * long-standing interpretation [of the statute] concurred in
by the State and Justice Departments [is] that membership in a
professional organization or trade union behind the Iron Curtain
is considered involuntary unless the membership is accompanied
by some indication of voluntariness, such as active participation in
the organization’s activities or holding an office in the organization.<a id="FNanchor_A15-205" href="#Footnote_A15-205" class="fnanchor">A15-205</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Since there was no evidence that Marina Oswald actively participated
in the union’s activities or held an office in the organization, her union
membership was properly held not to bar her admission to this
country.</p>

<p>Although Marina Oswald declared that she was not a member of
the Komsomol or any other Communist organization, she was in fact
a member of the Komsomol, the Communist youth organization.<a id="FNanchor_A15-206" href="#Footnote_A15-206" class="fnanchor">A15-206</a> If
this fact had been known to the State Department, Marina Oswald
would not necessarily have been denied a visa, although a careful investigation
into the nature of the membership would have been required.<a id="FNanchor_A15-207" href="#Footnote_A15-207" class="fnanchor">A15-207</a>
However, had her membership in the Komsomol become
known to the Department after her denial of such membership, it is
possible that she would have been excluded from the United States on
the ground of having willfully misrepresented a material fact.<a id="FNanchor_A15-208" href="#Footnote_A15-208" class="fnanchor">A15-208</a></p>

<p>Judicial decisions are not in agreement as to what constitutes a “material
fact” such that its intentional misrepresentation warrants exclusion
of the alien.<a id="FNanchor_A15-209" href="#Footnote_A15-209" class="fnanchor">A15-209</a> Some cases indicate that a misrepresentation in
an application for a visa involves a material fact even if the alien would
not definitely have been excluded on the true facts;<a id="FNanchor_A15-210" href="#Footnote_A15-210" class="fnanchor">A15-210</a> others hold
that a misstatement is material only if it referred to such facts as
would have justified refusing the visa had they been disclosed.<a id="FNanchor_A15-211" href="#Footnote_A15-211" class="fnanchor">A15-211</a> The
Visa Office of the Department of State has announced that it applies
a “rule of probability” under which a misstatement will be deemed material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_768">768</span>
only if it concealed facts which probably would have resulted
in a denial of a visa.<a id="FNanchor_A15-212" href="#Footnote_A15-212" class="fnanchor">A15-212</a></p>

<p><i>Waiver of the provisions of section 243(g).</i>—Section 243(g) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, by its terms, prevented issuance
of a visa to Marina Oswald by the Moscow Embassy. The
section provides that upon notification of the Secretary of State by the
Attorney General that a country has refused or unduly delayed the acceptance
of a deportable alien from the United States who is a subject
or was a resident of that country, consular officers in such country are
not to issue visas to citizens of the country. The section had been invoked
against Russia on May 26, 1953. Nonetheless, although section
243(g) does not contain an express provision for waiver, the Justice
Department has concluded that the Attorney General possesses such
waiver powers.<a id="FNanchor_A15-213" href="#Footnote_A15-213" class="fnanchor">A15-213</a> Pursuant to this decision, the Department has
granted waivers in over 600 cases from the Soviet Union since 1953.<a id="FNanchor_A15-214" href="#Footnote_A15-214" class="fnanchor">A15-214</a>
The waiver procedures followed in 1962 were prescribed by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service. The relevant provision reads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Before adjudicating a petition for an eligible beneficiary residing
in the USSR, Czechoslovakia or Hungary, against which
sanctions have been imposed, the district director shall obtain a
report of investigation regarding the petitioner which shall include
an affiliation of a subversive nature disclosed by a neighborhood
investigation, local agency records and responses to Form
G-135a. * * * If no substantial derogatory security information
is developed, the district director may waive the sanctions in an
individual meritorious case for a beneficiary of a petition filed by
a reputable relative to accord status under Section 101(a)(27)
(A) or Section 203(a) (2), (3) or (4). * * * If substantial adverse
security information relating to the petitioner is developed,
the visa petition shall be processed on its merits and certified to
the regional commissioner for determination whether the sanctions
should be waived. The assistant commissioner shall endorse the
petition to show whether the Waiver is granted or denied, and
forward it and notify the appropriate field office of the action
taken. * * *<a id="FNanchor_A15-215" href="#Footnote_A15-215" class="fnanchor">A15-215</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">State Department regulations are much less explicit.<a id="FNanchor_A15-216" href="#Footnote_A15-216" class="fnanchor">A15-216</a> The State
Department’s visa instructions for the guidance of consular officers
provide, “The sanctions will be waived only in individual meritorious
cases in behalf of a beneficiary of a petition filed by a reputable relative
pursuant to [sections] of the act.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-217" href="#Footnote_A15-217" class="fnanchor">A15-217</a></p>

<p>Because Lee Harvey Oswald signed the petition on Marina’s behalf,
his character was relevant to whether the sanctions of section 243(g)
could be waived for her. The file on Lee Harvey Oswald which was
maintained by the Department of State and made available to the Department
of Justice for purposes of passing on his wife’s application
contained the facts relating to Oswald’s attempted expatriation.
However, despite the derogatory material in the Oswald file, the Immigration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_769">769</span>
and Naturalization Service regulations did not require
automatic denial of the waiver; they provided only that if adverse
security information were developed, “the visa petition shall be processed
on its merits and certified to the regional commissioner for determination
whether the sanctions should be waived.” This procedure
was followed in Marina’s case and the factors considered in reaching
the decision do not appear to be inappropriate. The State Department
successfully urged that the original decision of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service be reversed because this would be in the best
interests of future United States dealings with the Soviet Union on
behalf of American citizens, and because it seemed unfair to punish
Lee Harvey Oswald’s wife and baby for his own earlier errors.<a id="FNanchor_A15-218" href="#Footnote_A15-218" class="fnanchor">A15-218</a>
Prevention of the separation of families is among the most common
reasons underlying the frequent waivers of section 243(g).<a id="FNanchor_A15-219" href="#Footnote_A15-219" class="fnanchor">A15-219</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr259">OSWALD’S LETTER TO SENATOR TOWER</h3>

<p>Sometime shortly before January 26, 1962, an undated letter from
Lee Harvey Oswald was received in the office of the U.S. Senator from
Texas, John G. Tower.<a id="FNanchor_A15-220" href="#Footnote_A15-220" class="fnanchor">A15-220</a> The letter reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My name is Lee Harvey Oswald, 22, of Fort Worth up till
October 1959, when I came to the Soviet Union for a residenaul
stay. I took a residenual document for a non-Soviet person living
for a time in the USSR. The American Embassy in Moscow is
familier with my case</p>

<p>Since July 20th 1960, I have unsucessfully applied for a Soviet
Exit Visa to leave this country, the Soviets refuse to permit me
and my Soviet wife, (who applied at the U.S. Embassy Moscow,
July 8, 1960 for immigration status to the U.S.A.) to leave the
Soviet Union. I am a citizen of the United States of America
(passport No. 1733242, 1959) and I bessech you, Senator Tower,
to rise the question of holding by the Soviet Union of a citizen
of the U.S., against his will and expressed desires.<a id="FNanchor_A15-221" href="#Footnote_A15-221" class="fnanchor">A15-221</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The letter was read in Senator Tower’s office by a caseworker on
his staff. According to the caseworker and the Senator’s press secretary,
the letter was forwarded as a matter of routine on January 26
to the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations, Department
of State. The letter was forwarded with a cover letter, machine
signed by the Senator, stating that he did “not know Oswald, or any
of the facts concerning his reasons for visiting the Soviet Union; nor
what action, if any, this Government can or should take on his behalf.”
The cover letter pointed out that Oswald’s inquiry should have gone
to the executive branch of the Government and that for this reason
the Senator was forwarding it “for whatever action the Department
may consider appropriate.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-222" href="#Footnote_A15-222" class="fnanchor">A15-222</a> On February 1 an officer at the Department
of State telephoned the Senator’s office and spoke briefly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_770">770</span>
with the caseworker on the Oswald case. She made a memorandum
of the call which notes, “Senator should not become involved in such
case—therefore State will report to us the course which they follow
regarding Lee Harvey Oswalt [sic].”<a id="FNanchor_A15-223" href="#Footnote_A15-223" class="fnanchor">A15-223</a> About a week later the
Department of State forwarded to Senator Tower copies of some of
the correspondence which the Department had had with Oswald and
informed the Senator that if he wished to be kept informed on further
developments regarding Oswald he could contact the Department of
State.<a id="FNanchor_A15-224" href="#Footnote_A15-224" class="fnanchor">A15-224</a> Neither the Senator nor any member of his staff contacted
the Department again nor did they take any other action in respect
to the matter.<a id="FNanchor_A15-225" href="#Footnote_A15-225" class="fnanchor">A15-225</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr260">THE LOAN FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT</h3>

<p>In a letter dated January 5, 1962, Oswald said that he would like
to make arrangements for a loan from the Embassy or some private
organization for part of the airplane fares.<a id="FNanchor_A15-226" href="#Footnote_A15-226" class="fnanchor">A15-226</a> The Embassy on February
6, 1962, replied that he would have to supply certain personal
and financial data.<a id="FNanchor_A15-227" href="#Footnote_A15-227" class="fnanchor">A15-227</a> The letter also said that after repatriation he
would not be furnished a passport for travel abroad until he had
repaid the money.</p>

<p>Between February 6, 1962, and May 1, 1962, Oswald attempted to
secure a loan from the Red Cross<a id="FNanchor_A15-228" href="#Footnote_A15-228" class="fnanchor">A15-228</a> and the International Rescue
Committee<a id="FNanchor_A15-229" href="#Footnote_A15-229" class="fnanchor">A15-229</a> in the United States. The State Department on February
1 wrote Oswald’s mother a letter asking whether she could
advance the money.<a id="FNanchor_A15-230" href="#Footnote_A15-230" class="fnanchor">A15-230</a> Oswald later wrote both his mother and the
Department advising each that his mother should not be bothered in
reference to the loan.<a id="FNanchor_A15-231" href="#Footnote_A15-231" class="fnanchor">A15-231</a> Ultimately, after an exchange of communications
between the Embassy and Washington,<a id="FNanchor_A15-232" href="#Footnote_A15-232" class="fnanchor">A15-232</a> the Department approved
a loan to Oswald for passage to New York only, directing the
Embassy to “Keep cost minimum.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-233" href="#Footnote_A15-233" class="fnanchor">A15-233</a> On June 1 Oswald signed
a promissory note for $435.71.<a id="FNanchor_A15-234" href="#Footnote_A15-234" class="fnanchor">A15-234</a></p>

<p>Statutory authority for making such a loan was conferred by title 5,
section 170(a), of the U.S. Code, which authorizes the Secretary of
State to “make expenditures, from such amounts as may be specifically
appropriated therefor, for unforeseen emergencies arising in the diplomatic
and consular service.” Since 1947, the Department of State’s
annual appropriation act has included a sum for expenses necessary
“to enable the Secretary of State to meet unforeseen emergencies
arising in the Diplomatic and Consular Service. * * *”<a id="FNanchor_A15-235" href="#Footnote_A15-235" class="fnanchor">A15-235</a> In recent
years, the accompanying reports submitted by the Appropriations
Committee of the House of Representatives have stated, “These funds
are used for relief and repatriation loans to the U.S. citizens abroad
and for other emergencies of the Department.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-236" href="#Footnote_A15-236" class="fnanchor">A15-236</a> Out of the amount
appropriated to meet unforeseen emergencies arising in the Diplomatic
and Consular Service, the Secretary of State has annually
allotted approximately $100,000 to meet the expenses of indigent
U.S. nationals, including those in the Soviet Union, who request<span class="pagenum" id="Page_771">771</span>
repatriation loans. From 1959 to 1963, 2,343 such loans were
granted.<a id="FNanchor_A15-237" href="#Footnote_A15-237" class="fnanchor">A15-237</a></p>

<p>Section 423.2-1 of the Department’s regulations provides that repatriation
loans may be granted only to destitute U.S. nationals:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>a. Who are in complete and unquestioned possession of their
citizenship rights;</p>

<p>b. Who are entitled to receive United States passports;</p>

<p>c. Whose loyalty to the United States Government is beyond
question, or to whom the provisions of Section 423.1-2(b)
apply.<a id="FNanchor_A15-238" href="#Footnote_A15-238" class="fnanchor">A15-238</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Oswald undoubtedly satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (a)
and (b), since he was determined to have been a U.S. citizen at the
time the loan was granted and he had been issued a passport to return
to the United States. There is a serious question whether he could
have qualified under the first clause of paragraph (c). The Commission
is of the opinion that in its application of this clause the Department
should exercise great care in determining whether an applicant’s
loyalty to the U.S. Government is beyond question, particularly in
the case of a defector like Oswald who has expressed hostility and
disloyalty to our government and manifested a desire to renounce
his citizenship. The Department chose instead to exercise its judgment
under the second clause of paragraph (c), which refers to section
423.1-2(b). This section provides that loans to destitute nationals
are authorized when:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>b. The United States national is in or the cause of a situation
which is damaging to the prestige of the United States Government
or which constitutes a compelling reason for extending
assistance to effect his return.<a id="FNanchor_A15-239" href="#Footnote_A15-239" class="fnanchor">A15-239</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The Department decided that the provisions of section (b) were
applicable to Oswald because his “unstable character and prior criticism
of the United States” would make his continued presence in the
Soviet Union damaging to the prestige of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A15-240" href="#Footnote_A15-240" class="fnanchor">A15-240</a> In
acting under this section, the Department was acting within its competence
and the law. As required by another section of the regulations,
the Department sought to obtain funds for the Oswalds’ repatriation
from private sources—his mother and the International Rescue
Committee—before using Government funds.<a id="FNanchor_A15-241" href="#Footnote_A15-241" class="fnanchor">A15-241</a></p>

<p>Regulations further provide that repatriation loans are authorized
for the alien, wife, and children of the U.S. national receiving a
repatriation loan in order to avoid the division of families.<a id="FNanchor_A15-242" href="#Footnote_A15-242" class="fnanchor">A15-242</a> However,
loans are limited</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To the minimum amount required to cover transportation and
subsistence while enroute to the nearest continental United States
port. * * * When necessary, loans may include: expenses incident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_772">772</span>
to embarkation, such as fees for documentation and minimum
subsistence from the date of application for a loan to the date
of departure by the first available ship. * * * The cost of transportation
shall be limited to third-class passage by ship.<a id="FNanchor_A15-243" href="#Footnote_A15-243" class="fnanchor">A15-243</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Oswald’s loan was sufficient to cover no more than the least expensive
transportation from Moscow to New York. His passport was stamped
as valid only for return to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A15-244" href="#Footnote_A15-244" class="fnanchor">A15-244</a> Oswald completed
all necessary forms and affidavits to obtain the loan.<a id="FNanchor_A15-245" href="#Footnote_A15-245" class="fnanchor">A15-245</a></p>

<p>According to its own procedures the Department of State should
have prepared a lookout card for Oswald in June 1962 when he
received the proceeds of the loan.<a id="FNanchor_A15-246" href="#Footnote_A15-246" class="fnanchor">A15-246</a> The promissory note which he
signed contained a provision stating,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I further understand and agree that after my repatriation I
will not be furnished a passport for travel abroad until my obligation
to reimburse the Treasurer of the United States is liquidated.<a id="FNanchor_A15-247" href="#Footnote_A15-247" class="fnanchor">A15-247</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">However, a lookout card was never in fact prepared. With respect to
this failure the State Department has informed the Commission as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On receipt of notice of the loan from the Embassy in Moscow,
the Department’s procedures provided that Miss Leola B. Burkhead
of the Revenues and Receipts Branch of the Office of Finance
should have notified the Clearance Section in the Passport Office
of Oswald’s name, date, and place of birth. If the Passport
Office received only the name and not the date and place of birth
of a borrower, it would not have prepared a lookout card under
its established procedures because of lack of positive identification.
(Among the Passport Office’s file of millions of passport applicants,
there are, of course, many thousands of identical names.)
Mr. Richmond C. Reeley was the Chief of the Revenues and
Receipts Branch of the Office of Finance and Mr. Alexander W.
Maxwell was Chief of the Clearance Section. If the notice was
received in the Clearance Section it would have been delivered to
the Carding Desk for preparation of a lookout card on Oswald.
It appears, however, that such a lookout card was not prepared.
It may have been that the Finance Office did not notify the Clearance
Section of Oswald’s loan. One reason for this might have
been the Finance Office’s lack of information concerning Oswald’s
date and place of birth. On the other hand, the Finance Office
may have notified the Clearance Section of Oswald’s name only,
in which case this Section would not have prepared a lookout card
under its procedures. Since Oswald began repaying the loan in
installments immediately after his return to the United States, it
is also possible that the Office of Finance decided that it was unnecessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_773">773</span>
to pursue the matter further. In any event, Oswald’s
loan was repaid in full on January 29, 1963, five months prior to
his application for a new passport.<a id="FNanchor_A15-248" href="#Footnote_A15-248" class="fnanchor">A15-248</a></p></blockquote>

<h3 id="hdr261">OSWALD’S RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES AND REPAYMENT OF HIS LOAN</h3>

<p>On June 1, 1962, the some day that Oswald received his loan from
the State Department, he and his family left Moscow by train destined
for Rotterdam, The Netherlands.<a id="FNanchor_A15-249" href="#Footnote_A15-249" class="fnanchor">A15-249</a> They boarded the SS <i>Maasdam</i>
at Rotterdam on June 4 and arrived in New York on June 13, 1962.<a id="FNanchor_A15-250" href="#Footnote_A15-250" class="fnanchor">A15-250</a>
The Embassy sent word of the Oswalds’ departure to the Department
of State in Washington on May 31.<a id="FNanchor_A15-251" href="#Footnote_A15-251" class="fnanchor">A15-251</a> Consistent with its prior practice
of keeping the Federal security agencies informed of Oswald’s
activity,<a id="FNanchor_A15-252" href="#Footnote_A15-252" class="fnanchor">A15-252</a> the Department notified the FBI.<a id="FNanchor_A15-253" href="#Footnote_A15-253" class="fnanchor">A15-253</a></p>

<p>Frederick J. Wiedersheim, an officer of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in New York, interviewed the Oswalds upon their
entry into the United States at Hoboken, N.J., on June 13, 1962, but
made no written report. Mr. Wiedersheim recalled that he asked the
Oswalds various questions which would determine the eligibility of
both Oswald and Marina to enter the United States. The questions
included whether Oswald had expatriated himself and whether Marina
belonged to any Communist organization which would bar her entry.
These questions were answered in ways which did not appear to raise
any problems and therefore the Oswalds were admitted.<a id="FNanchor_A15-254" href="#Footnote_A15-254" class="fnanchor">A15-254</a></p>

<p>After his reentry, Oswald repaid his loan without having to be reminded
by the Department to do so. The early payments were very
small because he first repaid the approximately $200 he had borrowed
from his brother Robert to apply against the expenses of his travel
from New York to Fort Worth, Tex.<a id="FNanchor_A15-255" href="#Footnote_A15-255" class="fnanchor">A15-255</a> The schedule of payments is

<h3 id="hdr262">ISSUANCE OF A PASSPORT IN JUNE 1963</h3>

<p>On June 24, 1963, Oswald applied for a U.S. passport at the Passport
Office in New Orleans, La.<a id="FNanchor_A15-257" href="#Footnote_A15-257" class="fnanchor">A15-257</a> He said he was planning to visit
England, France, Holland, U.S.S.R., Finland, Italy, and Poland, and
that he intended to leave the country sometime during November or
December 1963 by ship from New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_A15-258" href="#Footnote_A15-258" class="fnanchor">A15-258</a> He stated further that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_774">774</span>
he was married to a person born in Russia who was not an American
citizen. For occupation, the word “Photographer” was inserted on the
application.<a id="FNanchor_A15-259" href="#Footnote_A15-259" class="fnanchor">A15-259</a></p>

<p>On the same day a teletype was sent to Washington containing the
names of 25 of the persons who applied for passports on that date in
New Orleans, Oswald’s name among them. On the right side of the
Washington Passport Office copy of the teletype message, approximately
parallel to his name, are the letters, “NO,” written in red pencil.<a id="FNanchor_A15-260" href="#Footnote_A15-260" class="fnanchor">A15-260</a>
Oswald was issued a passport on June 25, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_A15-261" href="#Footnote_A15-261" class="fnanchor">A15-261</a></p>

<p>Since there was no lookout card on Oswald, the passport was processed
routinely. Twenty-four hours is the usual time for routinely
granted passports to be issued.<a id="FNanchor_A15-262" href="#Footnote_A15-262" class="fnanchor">A15-262</a> The handwritten notation, “NO,”
which appeared beside Oswald’s name on the list of applicants from
New Orleans, is a symbol for the New Orleans Passport Office that is
routinely placed on incoming teletype messages by anyone of a group
of persons in the teletype section of the Passport Office.<a id="FNanchor_A15-263" href="#Footnote_A15-263" class="fnanchor">A15-263</a> No one
looked at Oswald’s file previously established with the Department.<a id="FNanchor_A15-264" href="#Footnote_A15-264" class="fnanchor">A15-264</a>
The Department, however, has informed the Commission that at the
time the passport was issued there was no information in its passport
or security files which would have permitted it to deny a passport to
Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A15-265" href="#Footnote_A15-265" class="fnanchor">A15-265</a> No lookout card should have been in the file based upon
the Moscow Embassy’s memorandum of March 28, 1960, which drew
attention to Oswald’s intention to expatriate himself, because the subsequent
determination that Oswald had not expatriated himself would
remove expatriation as a possible ground for denying him a passport.<a id="FNanchor_A15-266" href="#Footnote_A15-266" class="fnanchor">A15-266</a>
And by January 29, 1963, the repatriation loan had been repaid, so a
lookout card should not have been in the file on that basis.<a id="FNanchor_A15-267" href="#Footnote_A15-267" class="fnanchor">A15-267</a></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Oswald was entitled to receive a passport in 1963 unless he came
within one of the two statutory provisions authorizing the Secretary
of State to refuse to issue it.<a id="FNanchor_A15-268" href="#Footnote_A15-268" class="fnanchor">A15-268</a> Section 6 of the Subversive Activities
Control Act of 1950, which has recently been declared unconstitutional,<a id="FNanchor_A15-269" href="#Footnote_A15-269" class="fnanchor">A15-269</a>
then provided:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * it shall be unlawful for any member of [an organization
required to register], with knowledge or notice that such organization
is so registered and that such order has become final—(1)
to make application for passport, or the renewal of a passport,
to be issued or renewed by or under the authority of the United
States; or (2) to use or attempt to use any such passport.<a id="FNanchor_A15-270" href="#Footnote_A15-270" class="fnanchor">A15-270</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Pursuant to section 6, the State Department promulgated a regulation
which denied passports to</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * any individual who the issuing officer knows or has reason
to believe is a member of a Communist Organization registered
or required to be registered under Section 7 of the Subversive
Activities Control Act of 1950 as amended.<a id="FNanchor_A15-271" href="#Footnote_A15-271" class="fnanchor">A15-271</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_775">775</span>
Since there is no evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald was a member of
the American Communist Party or any other organization which had
been required to register under section 7 of the Subversive Activities
Control Act,<a id="FNanchor_A15-272" href="#Footnote_A15-272" class="fnanchor">A15-272</a> a passport could not have been denied him under
section 6.</p>

<p>Section 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides
that, while a Presidential proclamation of national emergency is
in force,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * it shall, except as otherwise provided by the President, * * *
be unlawful for any citizen of the United States to depart from
or enter * * * the United States unless he bears a valid passport.<a id="FNanchor_A15-273" href="#Footnote_A15-273" class="fnanchor">A15-273</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Because a proclamation of national emergency issued by President
Truman during the Korean war had not been revoked by 1963, the
Government has taken the position that the statute remains in force.<a id="FNanchor_A15-274" href="#Footnote_A15-274" class="fnanchor">A15-274</a>
Pursuant to section 215, the State Department has issued regulations
setting forth the circumstances under which it will refuse a passport:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In order to promote and safeguard the interests of the United
States, passport facilities, except for direct and immediate return
to the United States, shall be refused to a person when it
appears to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that the
person’s activity abroad would: (a) violate the laws of the United
States; (b) be prejudicial to the orderly conduct of foreign relations;
or (c) otherwise be prejudicial to the interests of the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_A15-275" href="#Footnote_A15-275" class="fnanchor">A15-275</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The State Department takes the position that its authority under
this regulation is severely limited. In a report submitted to the Commission,
the Department concluded that “there were no grounds consonant
with the passport regulations to take adverse passport action
against Oswald prior to November 22, 1963.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-276" href="#Footnote_A15-276" class="fnanchor">A15-276</a> Although Oswald’s
statement in 1959 that he would furnish the Russians with information
he had obtained in the Marine Corps may have indicated that he
would disclose classified information if he possessed any such information,
there was no indication in 1963 that he had any valuable
information.<a id="FNanchor_A15-277" href="#Footnote_A15-277" class="fnanchor">A15-277</a> Moreover, Oswald’s 1959 statement had been brought
to the attention of the Department of the Navy<a id="FNanchor_A15-278" href="#Footnote_A15-278" class="fnanchor">A15-278</a> and the FBI<a id="FNanchor_A15-279" href="#Footnote_A15-279" class="fnanchor">A15-279</a>
and neither organization had initiated criminal proceedings. The
Department therefore had no basis for concluding that Oswald’s
1959 statement was anything more than rash talk.<a id="FNanchor_A15-280" href="#Footnote_A15-280" class="fnanchor">A15-280</a> And the State
Department’s files contained no other information which might reasonably
have led it to expect that Oswald would violate the laws of
the United States when he went abroad.</p>

<p>The most likely ground for denying Oswald a passport in 1963,
however, was provided by subsection (c) of the regulation quoted
above, which requires the denial of a passport when the Secretary of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_776">776</span>
State is satisfied that the applicant’s “activity abroad would * * *
otherwise be prejudicial to the interests of the United States.” In
1957 the State Department described to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee one category of persons to whom it denied passports under
this provision:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Persons whose previous conduct abroad has been such as to
bring discredit on the United States and cause difficulty for other
Americans (gave bad checks, left unpaid debts, had difficulties
with police, etc.).<a id="FNanchor_A15-281" href="#Footnote_A15-281" class="fnanchor">A15-281</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In light of the adverse publicity caused the United States by Oswald’s
prior defection to the Soviet Union, he could have been considered
a person “whose previous conduct abroad had been such as to bring
discredit on the United States.” Indeed, the State Department itself
had previously been of the opinion that Oswald’s continued presence
in Russia was damaging to the prestige of the United States because
of his unstable character and prior criticisms of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A15-282" href="#Footnote_A15-282" class="fnanchor">A15-282</a></p>

<p>However, in 1958 the Supreme Court had decided two cases which
restricted the Secretary of State’s authority to deny passports. In
<i>Kent</i> v. <i>Dulles</i><a id="FNanchor_A15-283" href="#Footnote_A15-283" class="fnanchor">A15-283</a> and <i>Dayton</i> v. <i>Dulles</i>,<a id="FNanchor_A15-284" href="#Footnote_A15-284" class="fnanchor">A15-284</a> the Supreme Court invalidated
a State Department regulation permitting the denial of passports
to Communists and to those “who are going abroad to engage in
activities which will advance the Communist movement for the purpose,
knowingly and willfully of advancing that movement,” on the
ground that the regulation exceeded the authority Congress had
granted the Secretary. The <i>Kent</i> opinion stressed the importance to be
attached to an individual’s ability to travel beyond the borders of the
United States:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The right to travel is a part of the “liberty” of which the
citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under
the Fifth Amendment * * * Freedom of movement across frontiers
in either direction, and inside frontiers as well, was a part
of our heritage. Travel abroad, like travel within the country,
may be necessary for a livelihood. It may be as close to the heart
of the individual as the choice of what he eats, or wears, or reads.
Freedom of movement is basic in our scheme of values.<a id="FNanchor_A15-285" href="#Footnote_A15-285" class="fnanchor">A15-285</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The <i>Kent</i> opinion also suggested that grounds relating to citizenship
and allegiance to illegal conduct might be the only two upon which
the Department could validly deny a passport application.</p>

<p>The Department, though publicly declaring that these decisions
had little effect upon its broadly worded regulation,<a id="FNanchor_A15-286" href="#Footnote_A15-286" class="fnanchor">A15-286</a> in practice
denied passports only in limited situations. In 1963 the Department
denied passports only to those who violated the Department’s travel
restrictions, to fugitives from justice, to those involved in using
passports fraudulently, and to those engaged in illegal activity abroad
or in conduct directly affecting our relations with a particular country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_777">777</span><a id="FNanchor_A15-287" href="#Footnote_A15-287" class="fnanchor">A15-287</a>
Passports were granted to people who the Department might
have anticipated would go abroad to denounce the United States, and
to a prior defector.<a id="FNanchor_A15-288" href="#Footnote_A15-288" class="fnanchor">A15-288</a> State Department officials believed that in
view of the Supreme Court decisions, the Department was not empowered
to deny anyone a passport on grounds related to freedom
of speech or to political association and beliefs.<a id="FNanchor_A15-289" href="#Footnote_A15-289" class="fnanchor">A15-289</a></p>

<p>Since Oswald’s citizenship was not in question and since there was
no indication that he would be involved in illegal activity abroad,
the only grounds upon which a passport might have been denied
Oswald would have fallen within the area of speech or political belief
and association. The Commission therefore concludes that the Department
was justified in granting a passport to Oswald on June 25,
1963.</p>

<h3 id="hdr263">VISIT TO THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY</h3>

<p>In October 1963, the Passport Office of the State Department received
a report from the Central Intelligence Agency that Oswald
had visited the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City.<a id="FNanchor_A15-290" href="#Footnote_A15-290" class="fnanchor">A15-290</a> The report said
nothing about Oswald’s having visited the Cuban Embassy in Mexico
City, a fact which was not known until after the assassination. Upon
receipt of the information the passport file on Lee Harvey Oswald was
reviewed by the Passport Office.<a id="FNanchor_A15-291" href="#Footnote_A15-291" class="fnanchor">A15-291</a> The CIA communication and the
passport file were read by an attorney and a supervisory attorney in
that office who found no basis for revoking Oswald’s passport or for
notifying the FBI or CIA that Oswald had been issued a new passport
in June 1963.<a id="FNanchor_A15-292" href="#Footnote_A15-292" class="fnanchor">A15-292</a> The Department has informed the Commission
that, “since the report indicated no grounds for determining Oswald
was ineligible for a passport, a determination was made that no action
by the passport office was required.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-293" href="#Footnote_A15-293" class="fnanchor">A15-293</a> Travel to Russia was not proscribed
in 1963. Moreover, the Soviet Union was one of the countries
Oswald had listed on his passport application. Hence, the Commission
agrees that Oswald’s taking steps to enter the Soviet Union in
1963 was not a sufficient reason to revoke his passport.</p>

<p>Later, on November 14, 1963, the FBI sent the Department a report
on Oswald’s arrest in New Orleans, La. during August in connection
with a fistfight in which he became engaged when passing out pamphlets
entitled “Hands Off Cuba.” No action was taken on the basis
of the Bureau’s report.<a id="FNanchor_A15-294" href="#Footnote_A15-294" class="fnanchor">A15-294</a> The Commission agrees that this incident
was not grounds for revoking Oswald’s passport.</p>

<h3 id="hdr264">CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>Investigation of Oswald’s complete dealings with the Department
of State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service reveals no
irregularity suggesting any illegal actions or impropriety on the part
of government officials. The Commission believes, however, that in applying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_778">778</span>
its own regulations the Department should in all cases exercise
great care in the return to this country of defectors such as Oswald
who have evidenced disloyalty or hostility to this country or who have
expressed a desire to renounce their U.S. citizenship and that, when
such persons are returned, procedures should be adopted for the better
dissemination of information concerning them to the intelligence
agencies of the Government. The operation of the “lookout card”
system in the Department of State was obviously deficient, but since
these deficiencies did not affect Oswald or reflect any favoritism or
impropriety, the Commission considers them beyond the scope of its
inquiry.</p>

<p>Especially while he was in the Soviet Union, Oswald’s manner to
Government personnel was frequently insulting and offensive. As
one 1962 communication between the Embassy and the Department of
State observed, “It is not that our hearts are breaking for Oswald.
His impertinence knows no bounds.”<a id="FNanchor_A15-295" href="#Footnote_A15-295" class="fnanchor">A15-295</a> Nonetheless, the officials of
the U.S. Government respected Oswald as a troubled American citizen
and extended to him the services and assistance for which the
agencies of government have been created. Though Oswald was
known to be “an unstable character, whose actions are highly unpredictable,”<a id="FNanchor_A15-296" href="#Footnote_A15-296" class="fnanchor">A15-296</a>
there was no reasonable basis in 1961 and 1962 for suspecting
that upon his readmittance to the country he would resort to
violence against its public officials. The officers of the Department of
State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, acting within
the proper limits of their discretion, concluded that Oswald’s return
to the United States was in the best interests of the country; it is only
from the vantage of the present that the tragic irony of their conclusion
emerges.</p>

<h2 id="hdr265" class="vspace">APPENDIX XVI<br />

<span class="subhead">A Biography of Jack Ruby</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In this appendix the Commission presents a biography of Jack
Ruby. Although criminal proceedings involving its subject are pending
in the State of Texas, the Commission has decided to include this
rather detailed account of Ruby’s life and activities for several reasons.
Most importantly, the Commission believes it will permit a better
evaluation of the evidence on the question whether Ruby was involved
in any conspiracy. Furthermore, the Commission believes that
in view of the many rumors concerning Ruby the public interest will
be served by an account which attempts to give sufficient material
to provide an impression of his character and background. The Commission’s
desire not to interfere in the pending proceedings involving
Ruby necessarily limits the scope of this appendix, which does not
purport to discuss the legal issues raised during Ruby’s trial or his
possible motive for shooting Oswald.</p>

<h3 id="hdr266">FAMILY BACKGROUND</h3>

<p>Jack Ruby, born Jacob Rubenstein, was the fifth of his parents’
eight living children. There is much confusion about his exact birth
date. School records report it as June 23, April 25,<a id="FNanchor_A16-1" href="#Footnote_A16-1" class="fnanchor">A16-1</a> March 13, and,
possibly, March 3, 1911.<a id="FNanchor_A16-2" href="#Footnote_A16-2" class="fnanchor">A16-2</a> Other early official records list his date of
birth as April 21 and April 26, 1911.<a id="FNanchor_A16-3" href="#Footnote_A16-3" class="fnanchor">A16-3</a> During his adult life the date
Ruby used most frequently was March 25, 1911.<a id="FNanchor_A16-4" href="#Footnote_A16-4" class="fnanchor">A16-4</a> His driver’s license,
seized following his arrest, and his statements to the FBI on November
24, 1963, listed this date.<a id="FNanchor_A16-5" href="#Footnote_A16-5" class="fnanchor">A16-5</a> However, the police arrest report for
November 24 gave his birth date as March 19, 1911.<a id="FNanchor_A16-6" href="#Footnote_A16-6" class="fnanchor">A16-6</a> Since the recording
of births was not required in Chicago prior to 1915, Ruby’s
birth may never have been officially recorded.<a id="FNanchor_A16-7" href="#Footnote_A16-7" class="fnanchor">A16-7</a> No substantial conflict
exists, however, about whether Jack Ruby was born in 1911.<a id="FNanchor_A16-8" href="#Footnote_A16-8" class="fnanchor">A16-8</a></p>

<p>Ruby has one older brother and three older sisters. The oldest
children, Hyman and Ann, were born shortly after the turn of the
century,<a id="FNanchor_A16-9" href="#Footnote_A16-9" class="fnanchor">A16-9</a> before their parents arrived in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_A16-10" href="#Footnote_A16-10" class="fnanchor">A16-10</a> The
other children were born in Chicago. Ruby’s sister Marion was born
in June 1906<a id="FNanchor_A16-11" href="#Footnote_A16-11" class="fnanchor">A16-11</a> and his sister Eva in March 1909.<a id="FNanchor_A16-12" href="#Footnote_A16-12" class="fnanchor">A16-12</a> Ruby also has
two younger brothers and a younger sister. Sam was born in December
1912,<a id="FNanchor_A16-13" href="#Footnote_A16-13" class="fnanchor">A16-13</a> Earl in April 1915.<a id="FNanchor_A16-14" href="#Footnote_A16-14" class="fnanchor">A16-14</a> The youngest child, Eileen, was born
in July 1917.<a id="FNanchor_A16-15" href="#Footnote_A16-15" class="fnanchor">A16-15</a> At least one and possibly two other children died
during infancy.<a id="FNanchor_A16-16" href="#Footnote_A16-16" class="fnanchor">A16-16</a></p>

<p>Jack Ruby’s father, Joseph Rubenstein, was born in 1871 in Sokolov,
a small town near Warsaw, Poland, then under the rule of Czarist
Russia.<a id="FNanchor_A16-17" href="#Footnote_A16-17" class="fnanchor">A16-17</a> He entered the Russian artillery in 1893.<a id="FNanchor_A16-18" href="#Footnote_A16-18" class="fnanchor">A16-18</a> There he learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_780">780</span>
the carpentry trade, which had been practiced by his father and at
least one brother<a id="FNanchor_A16-19" href="#Footnote_A16-19" class="fnanchor">A16-19</a> and he picked up the habit of excessive drinking
that was to plague him for the rest of his life.<a id="FNanchor_A16-20" href="#Footnote_A16-20" class="fnanchor">A16-20</a> While in the army,<a id="FNanchor_A16-21" href="#Footnote_A16-21" class="fnanchor">A16-21</a>
he married Jack’s mother, Fannie Turek Rutkowski;<a id="FNanchor_A16-22" href="#Footnote_A16-22" class="fnanchor">A16-22</a> the marriage
was arranged, as was customary, by a professional matchmaker.<a id="FNanchor_A16-23" href="#Footnote_A16-23" class="fnanchor">A16-23</a>
According to his oldest son, Joseph Rubenstein served in China, Korea,
and Siberia, detesting these places and army life. Eventually, in 1898,
he simply “walked away” from it and about 4 years later he went to
England and Canada, entering the United States in 1903.<a id="FNanchor_A16-24" href="#Footnote_A16-24" class="fnanchor">A16-24</a></p>

<p>Settling in Chicago, Joseph Rubenstein joined the carpenters union
in 1904 and remained a member until his death in 1958.<a id="FNanchor_A16-25" href="#Footnote_A16-25" class="fnanchor">A16-25</a> Although
he worked fairly steadily until 1928, he was unemployed during the
last 30 years of his life.<a id="FNanchor_A16-26" href="#Footnote_A16-26" class="fnanchor">A16-26</a> The only other group which Joseph Rubenstein
joined consisted of fellow immigrants from Sokolov. His
daughter Eva described this group as purely social and completely
nonpolitical.<a id="FNanchor_A16-27" href="#Footnote_A16-27" class="fnanchor">A16-27</a></p>

<p>Jack Ruby’s mother, Fannie Rubenstein, was probably born in 1875
near Warsaw, Poland.<a id="FNanchor_A16-28" href="#Footnote_A16-28" class="fnanchor">A16-28</a> She followed her husband to the United
States in 1904 or 1905, accompanied by her children Hyman and Ann.<a id="FNanchor_A16-29" href="#Footnote_A16-29" class="fnanchor">A16-29</a>
An illiterate woman, she went to night school in about 1920 to learn
how to sign her name.<a id="FNanchor_A16-30" href="#Footnote_A16-30" class="fnanchor">A16-30</a> She apparently failed in this endeavor, however,
for an alien registration form, filed after about 35 years in the
United States, was signed by an “X”.<a id="FNanchor_A16-31" href="#Footnote_A16-31" class="fnanchor">A16-31</a> Although she apparently
learned some English, her speech was predominantly Yiddish, the primary
language of the Rubenstein household.<a id="FNanchor_A16-32" href="#Footnote_A16-32" class="fnanchor">A16-32</a> Still, Mrs. Rubenstein
felt strongly that her children required an education in order to better
themselves. She frequently argued about this with her husband, who
had received little, if any, formal education and firmly believed that
grammar school training was sufficient for his children.<a id="FNanchor_A16-33" href="#Footnote_A16-33" class="fnanchor">A16-33</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr267">CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH (1911-33)</h3>

<p>In 1911, when Jack Ruby was born, his family resided near 14th
and Newberry Streets in Chicago, the first in a series of Jewish neighborhoods
in which the Rubensteins lived during his childhood.<a id="FNanchor_A16-34" href="#Footnote_A16-34" class="fnanchor">A16-34</a> In
1916, the Rubensteins lived at 1232 Morgan Street, where they apparently
remained until 1921.<a id="FNanchor_A16-35" href="#Footnote_A16-35" class="fnanchor">A16-35</a> This was the fourth residence in the
first 5 years of Jack Ruby’s life.<a id="FNanchor_A16-36" href="#Footnote_A16-36" class="fnanchor">A16-36</a> Earl Ruby described one typical
neighborhood in which the family lived as a “ghetto” with “pushcarts
on the streets.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-37" href="#Footnote_A16-37" class="fnanchor">A16-37</a> His sister Eva characterized it as “below the middle
class but yet it wasn’t the poorest class.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-38" href="#Footnote_A16-38" class="fnanchor">A16-38</a> The family generally lived
near Italian sections, where there were frequent fights along ethnic
lines.<a id="FNanchor_A16-39" href="#Footnote_A16-39" class="fnanchor">A16-39</a></p>

<p>The Rubenstein home was marked by constant strife and the
parents were reported to have occasionally struck each other.<a id="FNanchor_A16-40" href="#Footnote_A16-40" class="fnanchor">A16-40</a> Between
1915 and 1921, Joseph Rubenstein was frequently arrested because
of disorderly conduct and assault and battery charges, some
filed by his wife.<a id="FNanchor_A16-41" href="#Footnote_A16-41" class="fnanchor">A16-41</a> In the spring of 1921, Jack Ruby’s parents separated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_781">781</span><a id="FNanchor_A16-42" href="#Footnote_A16-42" class="fnanchor">A16-42</a>
In 1937 Mrs. Rubenstein reported that she had desired a
divorce 15 years earlier, but her husband had been opposed to it.<a id="FNanchor_A16-43" href="#Footnote_A16-43" class="fnanchor">A16-43</a> The
predominant causes of the separation were apparently Joseph Rubenstein’s
excessive drinking and Fannie Rubenstein’s uncontrollable
temper. She resented her numerous pregnancies, believed her husband
to be unfaithful, and nagged him because he failed to make enough
money.<a id="FNanchor_A16-44" href="#Footnote_A16-44" class="fnanchor">A16-44</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr268">Psychiatric Report</h4>

<p>Young Jack soon showed the effects of parental discord. On June 6,
1922, at the age of 11, he was referred to the Institute for Juvenile
Research by the Jewish Social Service Bureau. The reason for the
referral was “truancy and incorrigible at home.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-45" href="#Footnote_A16-45" class="fnanchor">A16-45</a> On July 10, 1922,
the institute recommended to the bureau that Jack be placed in a new
environment where his characteristics might be understood and where
he might be afforded the supervision and recreation that would end
his interest in street gangs.<a id="FNanchor_A16-46" href="#Footnote_A16-46" class="fnanchor">A16-46</a> In March 1923, the institute advised the
bureau that “placement in a home, where intelligent supervision and
discipline can be given” was appropriate.<a id="FNanchor_A16-47" href="#Footnote_A16-47" class="fnanchor">A16-47</a></p>

<p>The institute’s psychiatric examination, which served as a basis for
these recommendations, took place in 1922, prior to the advent of many
techniques and theories of modern psychiatry,<a id="FNanchor_A16-48" href="#Footnote_A16-48" class="fnanchor">A16-48</a> but it is the most
objective evidence of Jack Ruby’s childhood character. According
to the psychiatric report, Jack was “quick tempered” and
“disobedient.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-49" href="#Footnote_A16-49" class="fnanchor">A16-49</a> He frequently disagreed openly with his mother,
whom he considered an inferior person with whose rules he did not
have to comply.<a id="FNanchor_A16-50" href="#Footnote_A16-50" class="fnanchor">A16-50</a> Jack told the institute’s interviewer that he ran
away from home because his mother lied to him and beat him.<a id="FNanchor_A16-51" href="#Footnote_A16-51" class="fnanchor">A16-51</a>
Although Mrs. Rubenstein was severe with her children, she was
described as totally incapable of coping with them “because of
their delinquencies, i.e., principally their destructive tendencies and
disregard for other people’s property.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-52" href="#Footnote_A16-52" class="fnanchor">A16-52</a> His mother’s “extreme
temperament” and quarrelsomeness were cited as possible causes of
Jack’s “bad behavior.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-53" href="#Footnote_A16-53" class="fnanchor">A16-53</a></p>

<p>Self-administered questionnaires revealed that Jack felt his classmates
were “picking” on him and that he could not get along with his
friends.<a id="FNanchor_A16-54" href="#Footnote_A16-54" class="fnanchor">A16-54</a> They also indicated that, although Jack described himself
as a good ballplayer, he did not belong to any clubs and was not a
member of any athletic teams.<a id="FNanchor_A16-55" href="#Footnote_A16-55" class="fnanchor">A16-55</a> Jack’s psychiatric interviewer
reported:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He could give no other good reason for running away from
school except that he went to amusement parks. He has some sex
knowledge and is greatly interested in sex matters. He stated
that the boys in the street tell him about these things. He also
claims that he can lick everyone and anybody in anything he wants
to do.<a id="FNanchor_A16-56" href="#Footnote_A16-56" class="fnanchor">A16-56</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_782">782</span>
The interviewer noted that during “mental tests” he reacted quickly,
often carelessly, and his attention was apt to wander so that he had to
be reprimanded.<a id="FNanchor_A16-57" href="#Footnote_A16-57" class="fnanchor">A16-57</a></p>

<p>A letter recommending the boy’s placement in a more wholesome
environment stated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He is egocentric and expects much attention, but is unable to
get it as there are many children at home. His behavior is further
colored by his early sex experiences, his great interest [in
sex] and the gang situation in the street. From a superficial
examination of his mother who was here with him, it is apparent
that she has no insight into his problem, and she is thoroughly
inadequate in the further training of this boy.<a id="FNanchor_A16-58" href="#Footnote_A16-58" class="fnanchor">A16-58</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Recognizing that the sketchiness of the case record precluded complete
diagnosis, Dr. Raymond E. Robertson, currently the superintendent
of the institute, reported nonetheless that it seems “firmly
established * * * [that] his unstable and disorganized home could
not provide Jack with the necessary controls and discipline.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-59" href="#Footnote_A16-59" class="fnanchor">A16-59</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr269">Placement in Foster Homes</h4>

<p>On July 10, 1923, a dependency hearing involving Jack, his younger
brothers Sam and Earl, and his sister Eileen, was held in Chicago’s
juvenile court.<a id="FNanchor_A16-60" href="#Footnote_A16-60" class="fnanchor">A16-60</a> The petition alleged that the children were not
receiving proper parental care. They had, until then, been in their
mother’s custody, living on Roosevelt Road, the border between Jewish
and Italian districts.<a id="FNanchor_A16-61" href="#Footnote_A16-61" class="fnanchor">A16-61</a> The juvenile court made a finding of dependency.
It appointed the Jewish Home Finding Society guardian
with the right to place the children in foster homes, and it ordered
Joseph Rubenstein to pay the court clerk $4 per week for the support
of each child. On November 24, 1924, this order was vacated, which
apparently signified the termination of the guardianship and the
return of the children to their mother. On April 8, 1925, the case
was continued “generally,” meaning that it was inactive but could
be reactivated if the court so desired.<a id="FNanchor_A16-62" href="#Footnote_A16-62" class="fnanchor">A16-62</a></p>

<p>Despite court records, the exact circumstances and length of time
that Jack Ruby lived away from home are not entirely clear. Records
indicate that Jack, Sam, Earl, and Eileen Rubenstein were
wards of the Jewish Home Finding Society “for a short time in
1922-23.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-63" href="#Footnote_A16-63" class="fnanchor">A16-63</a> However, Jack and Eileen stated they spent about 4
or 5 years in foster homes.<a id="FNanchor_A16-64" href="#Footnote_A16-64" class="fnanchor">A16-64</a> Earl testified that he and Sam were
originally sent to a private foster home and then lived on a farm
for a little more than a year, while Jack was on a different farm
“some distance away.” Subsequently the three brothers lived together
in another foster home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_783">783</span><a id="FNanchor_A16-65" href="#Footnote_A16-65" class="fnanchor">A16-65</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr270">Subsequent Home Life</h4>

<p>When Jack Ruby returned to his family, the unit was still disordered.
His father remained apart from the children at least until
1936 and perhaps until a few years later.<a id="FNanchor_A16-66" href="#Footnote_A16-66" class="fnanchor">A16-66</a> Mrs. Rubenstein’s
inability to manage her home, which had been reported by
the Institute for Juvenile Research in 1922, apparently continued.
For example, in 1937 Marion Rubenstein observed that her mother
“has never been any kind of a housekeeper, was careless with money,
and never took much interest in the children’s welfare * * * she
was selfish, jealous, disagreeable, and never cared to do anything in
the home but lie around and sleep.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-67" href="#Footnote_A16-67" class="fnanchor">A16-67</a> Dr. Hyman I. Rubenstein, the
son of Joseph Rubenstein’s brother, recalled that Jack Ruby’s mother
ran “an irregular household” and appeared to be “a rather disturbed
person of poor personal appearance with no incentive for cleaning
or cooking.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-68" href="#Footnote_A16-68" class="fnanchor">A16-68</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Rubenstein’s domestic shortcomings were accompanied by
symptoms of mental disease. In about 1913, 2 years after Jack was
born, Mrs. Rubenstein began to develop a delusion that a sticking
sensation in her throat was caused by a lodged fishbone.<a id="FNanchor_A16-69" href="#Footnote_A16-69" class="fnanchor">A16-69</a> Each
month Hyman, her oldest child, took her to a clinic. And each
month the examining doctor, finding no organic cause for discomfort,
informed her that there was nothing in her throat and that the sensation
was but a figment of her imagination. According to Hyman,
this practice continued for a number of years until Mrs. Rubenstein
tired of it.<a id="FNanchor_A16-70" href="#Footnote_A16-70" class="fnanchor">A16-70</a></p>

<p>In 1927, Mrs. Rubenstein once again began to visit clinics in connection
with her fishbone delusion. Three years later, a thyroidectomy
was performed, but she subsequently said it did nothing to
relieve her discomfort.<a id="FNanchor_A16-71" href="#Footnote_A16-71" class="fnanchor">A16-71</a> According to the Michael Reese Hospital,
whose clinic she had visited since 1927, Mrs. Rubenstein was suffering
from psychoneurosis with marked anxiety state.</p>

<p>By order of the county court of Cook County, Mrs. Rubenstein was
committed to Elgin State Hospital on July 16, 1937.<a id="FNanchor_A16-72" href="#Footnote_A16-72" class="fnanchor">A16-72</a> She was
paroled on October 17, 1937, 3 months after her commitment.<a id="FNanchor_A16-73" href="#Footnote_A16-73" class="fnanchor">A16-73</a> On
January 3, 1938, the Chicago State Hospital informed Elgin State
that the family desired that she be readmitted to the mental hospital.
The family reported that she was uncooperative, caused constant
discord, was very noisy, and used obscene language.<a id="FNanchor_A16-74" href="#Footnote_A16-74" class="fnanchor">A16-74</a> A State social
worker observed that Mrs. Rubenstein refused ever to leave the house,
explaining that her children would have thrown her things out had she
left. Mrs. Rubenstein rebuffed a suggestion by the social worker that
she help with the dishes by stating that she would do nothing as long
as her “worthless” husband was in the house.<a id="FNanchor_A16-75" href="#Footnote_A16-75" class="fnanchor">A16-75</a> She was readmitted on
January 14, 1938.<a id="FNanchor_A16-76" href="#Footnote_A16-76" class="fnanchor">A16-76</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Rubenstein was again paroled on May 27, 1938, and was discharged
as “improved” on August 25, 1938.<a id="FNanchor_A16-77" href="#Footnote_A16-77" class="fnanchor">A16-77</a> She stayed in an apartment
with Marion, and her separation from the rest of the family
apparently ended most of the difficulties.<a id="FNanchor_A16-78" href="#Footnote_A16-78" class="fnanchor">A16-78</a> Subsequently, Jack Ruby’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_784">784</span>
parents were apparently reconciled, since their alien registration
forms, filed in late 1940, indicated that they both resided at Marion’s
address.<a id="FNanchor_A16-79" href="#Footnote_A16-79" class="fnanchor">A16-79</a></p>

<p>Fannie Rubenstein was admitted to Michael Reese Hospital on
April 4, 1944, as a result of a heart ailment. Her condition was complicated
by an attack of pneumonia and she died at the hospital on
April 11, 1944.<a id="FNanchor_A16-80" href="#Footnote_A16-80" class="fnanchor">A16-80</a> Hyman testified that, perhaps because she favored
the education of her children and they recognized her difficulties in
rearing them during a turbulent marriage, they all remembered Mrs.
Rubenstein with warmth and affection.<a id="FNanchor_A16-81" href="#Footnote_A16-81" class="fnanchor">A16-81</a> The evidence also indicates
that Jack, notwithstanding his earlier attitudes, became especially
fond of his mother.<a id="FNanchor_A16-82" href="#Footnote_A16-82" class="fnanchor">A16-82</a> Following his wife’s death, Joseph Rubenstein
stayed with the children in Chicago, where he died at the age of 87,
on December 24, 1958.<a id="FNanchor_A16-83" href="#Footnote_A16-83" class="fnanchor">A16-83</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr271">Education</h4>

<p>Records provided by the Chicago Board of Education revealed
that Jack Ruby attended Smyth Grammar School from October 24,
1916, through the 1920-21 term, completing kindergarten to grade
4B.<a id="FNanchor_A16-84" href="#Footnote_A16-84" class="fnanchor">A16-84</a> He repeated the third grade.<a id="FNanchor_A16-85" href="#Footnote_A16-85" class="fnanchor">A16-85</a> During the 1921-22 school year
Jack finished the fourth grade at the Clarke School; he attended
Schley School for the 1924-25 term, when he completed the sixth
grade. Ruby’s relationship with the Institute for Juvenile Research
and the Jewish Home Finding Society may explain the lack of academic
records for the 1922-23 and 1923-24 school years. While there
is some uncertainty about Ruby’s education subsequent to September
1925,<a id="FNanchor_A16-86" href="#Footnote_A16-86" class="fnanchor">A16-86</a> it seems likely that he completed the eighth grade in 1927,
when he was 16. Although Jack Ruby and others have stated that
he attended at least 1 year of high school,<a id="FNanchor_A16-87" href="#Footnote_A16-87" class="fnanchor">A16-87</a> the Chicago Board of
Education could not locate any record of Ruby’s attending Chicago
high schools.<a id="FNanchor_A16-88" href="#Footnote_A16-88" class="fnanchor">A16-88</a> Considering the absence of academic records and
Jack’s apathetic attitude toward school,<a id="FNanchor_A16-89" href="#Footnote_A16-89" class="fnanchor">A16-89</a> the Commission deems it
unlikely that his education extended into high school.</p>

<p>Records of the Institute for Juvenile Research revealed that, as of
June 1922, Ruby had no religious education outside the public school
system.<a id="FNanchor_A16-90" href="#Footnote_A16-90" class="fnanchor">A16-90</a> However, according to their children, Jack’s parents made
some effort to inculcate in them a desire to adhere to the tenets of
Orthodox Judaism. Jewish dietary and festival laws were observed
and several of the children accompanied Joseph Rubenstein to the
synagogue.<a id="FNanchor_A16-91" href="#Footnote_A16-91" class="fnanchor">A16-91</a> Earl Ruby stated that all the boys received some
Hebrew school training until the breakup of the Rubenstein home in
1921.<a id="FNanchor_A16-92" href="#Footnote_A16-92" class="fnanchor">A16-92</a> However, Hyman Rubenstein testified that the instability and
economic necessities of the household and the children’s relationships
outside the home frustrated the religious efforts of Ruby’s parents.<a id="FNanchor_A16-93" href="#Footnote_A16-93" class="fnanchor">A16-93</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr272">Activities</h4>

<p>Born in a home that disintegrated when he was 10 and boasting no
substantial educational background, Jack Ruby early found himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_785">785</span>
on Chicago streets attempting to provide for himself and other members
of his family. An avid sports fan, he, together with many of
his friends, “scalped” tickets to various sporting events.<a id="FNanchor_A16-94" href="#Footnote_A16-94" class="fnanchor">A16-94</a> He also
sold numerous novelty items and knickknacks, particularly those connected
with professional and collegiate athletics. Even in his youth,
Ruby declined to work on a steady basis for someone else.<a id="FNanchor_A16-95" href="#Footnote_A16-95" class="fnanchor">A16-95</a></p>

<p>According to his brother Hyman, Jack Ruby’s only legal difficulty
as a youth resulted from an altercation with a policeman about ticket
scalping. Hyman, then active in local politics, was able to have
charges arising out of the incident dropped.<a id="FNanchor_A16-96" href="#Footnote_A16-96" class="fnanchor">A16-96</a> Ruby has indicated
that during the depression he served a short jail sentence for the unauthorized
sale of copyrighted sheet music.<a id="FNanchor_A16-97" href="#Footnote_A16-97" class="fnanchor">A16-97</a></p>

<p>The only other member of the Rubenstein family who appears to
have had any difficulty with the law while a youth was Hyman. On
May 1, 1916, Chicago’s juvenile court declared Hyman incorrigible,
a term covering a wide range of misbehavior. Because of the absence
of informative court records and the lapse of time, the misconduct
that occasioned this proceeding could not be ascertained, but Hyman
is not known to have encountered subsequent difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_A16-98" href="#Footnote_A16-98" class="fnanchor">A16-98</a> Some of
Ruby’s childhood friends eventually became criminals;<a id="FNanchor_A16-99" href="#Footnote_A16-99" class="fnanchor">A16-99</a> however,
Hyman Rubenstein, his sister Mrs. Eva Grant, and virtually all of
Ruby’s friends and acquaintances who were questioned reported that
he was not involved with Chicago’s criminal element.<a id="FNanchor_A16-100" href="#Footnote_A16-100" class="fnanchor">A16-100</a></p>

<p>The evidence indicates that young Jack was not interested in political
affairs.<a id="FNanchor_A16-101" href="#Footnote_A16-101" class="fnanchor">A16-101</a> Hyman was the only Rubenstein to participate actively
in politics. Sponsored by various political officials, he became a sidewalk
inspector and warehouse investigator for 8 years. On one occasion,
he obtained a permit for Jack to sell novelties from a pushcart
located in a business district during the pre-Christmas buying rush.
Eventually the complaints of enraged businessmen led licensing authorities
to declare that a mistake had been made and to revoke Ruby’s
permit.<a id="FNanchor_A16-102" href="#Footnote_A16-102" class="fnanchor">A16-102</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr273">Temperament</h4>

<p>The evidence reveals striking differences of opinion among childhood
friends and acquaintances of Jack Ruby about whether he possessed
violent tendencies. Many persons stated that he was mild
mannered, quiet, and even tempered.<a id="FNanchor_A16-103" href="#Footnote_A16-103" class="fnanchor">A16-103</a> Former welterweight champion
Barney Ross, whom Jack Ruby idolized from the inception of
his boxing career,<a id="FNanchor_A16-104" href="#Footnote_A16-104" class="fnanchor">A16-104</a> stated that Ruby was “well behaved,” was never
a troublemaker, and was never involved with law-enforcement agencies.<a id="FNanchor_A16-105" href="#Footnote_A16-105" class="fnanchor">A16-105</a>
Another friend, who became a successful businessman on the
west coast, said that, as a youth, Ruby never started fights even though
he was adept with his fists.<a id="FNanchor_A16-106" href="#Footnote_A16-106" class="fnanchor">A16-106</a> Other friends declared that he would,
if at all possible, avoid clashes.<a id="FNanchor_A16-107" href="#Footnote_A16-107" class="fnanchor">A16-107</a></p>

<p>But many other friends and acquaintances recalled that he had a
hot temper and was quickly moved to violent acts or words.<a id="FNanchor_A16-108" href="#Footnote_A16-108" class="fnanchor">A16-108</a> One
friend explained that in the “tough” Chicago neighborhood where
they lived, self-defense was vitally important and added that Ruby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_786">786</span>
was fully capable of defending himself.<a id="FNanchor_A16-109" href="#Footnote_A16-109" class="fnanchor">A16-109</a> Another friend described
Ruby as quick tempered and, though unlikely to pick fights, willing
to accept any challenge without regard to the odds against him.<a id="FNanchor_A16-110" href="#Footnote_A16-110" class="fnanchor">A16-110</a>
Young Jack also interfered in fights, particularly when the person he
was aiding appeared to be taking a severe beating or in a disadvantageous
position.<a id="FNanchor_A16-111" href="#Footnote_A16-111" class="fnanchor">A16-111</a> Others reported that he had the reputation of
being a good street brawler.<a id="FNanchor_A16-112" href="#Footnote_A16-112" class="fnanchor">A16-112</a> One school friend recalled that when
Jack argued vehemently about sports, he occasionally used a stick or
other available weapon. He reported, however, that after Ruby’s
anger subsided, he reverted to his normal, likable character.<a id="FNanchor_A16-113" href="#Footnote_A16-113" class="fnanchor">A16-113</a></p>

<p>From early childhood, Jack Ruby was called “Sparky” by those
who knew him.<a id="FNanchor_A16-114" href="#Footnote_A16-114" class="fnanchor">A16-114</a> According to his sister Eva Grant, the nickname
derived from the way Jack wobbled when he walked. He was thought
to resemble the slow-moving horse called “Sparky” or “Sparkplug”
depicted in a contemporary comic strip. Mrs. Grant testified that her
brother became incensed when called “Sparky” and that from the
time he was about 8 years old he would strike anyone calling him by
that name.<a id="FNanchor_A16-115" href="#Footnote_A16-115" class="fnanchor">A16-115</a> A childhood friend also recalled that Jack hated the
nickname and would fight when called by it.<a id="FNanchor_A16-116" href="#Footnote_A16-116" class="fnanchor">A16-116</a> Mrs. Grant was unsure
whether the nickname “Sparky” did not also result from his
quick reaction to the taunts of young friends.<a id="FNanchor_A16-117" href="#Footnote_A16-117" class="fnanchor">A16-117</a> Hyman Rubenstein
thought that the nickname derived from Jack’s speed, aggressiveness,
and quick thinking. The many accounts of Ruby’s lightninglike temper
lend credence to the theory, widely held, that his nickname was
connected with his volatility.<a id="FNanchor_A16-118" href="#Footnote_A16-118" class="fnanchor">A16-118</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr274">YOUNG MANHOOD (1933-43)</h3>

<h4 id="hdr275">San Francisco (1933-37)</h4>

<p>Jack Ruby reported that in about 1933, he and several Chicago
friends went to Los Angeles and, shortly thereafter, to San Francisco.<a id="FNanchor_A16-119" href="#Footnote_A16-119" class="fnanchor">A16-119</a>
Although there is evidence that he stayed there until 1938,
1939, or 1940,<a id="FNanchor_A16-120" href="#Footnote_A16-120" class="fnanchor">A16-120</a> Ruby stated that he returned to Chicago in about
1937,<a id="FNanchor_A16-121" href="#Footnote_A16-121" class="fnanchor">A16-121</a> and this appears to have been the case.<a id="FNanchor_A16-122" href="#Footnote_A16-122" class="fnanchor">A16-122</a> Eva Grant testified
that Ruby went to the west coast because he believed employment
would be available there.<a id="FNanchor_A16-123" href="#Footnote_A16-123" class="fnanchor">A16-123</a></p>

<p>Eva, who married Hyman Magid in Chicago in 1930,<a id="FNanchor_A16-124" href="#Footnote_A16-124" class="fnanchor">A16-124</a> was divorced
in early 1934, and in about June of that year joined her brother Jack
in San Francisco. She and her son, Ronald, shared an apartment with
him. In 1936, Eva married Frank Granovsky, also known as Frank
Grant, in San Francisco, and Ruby shared a four-room apartment
with them and Ronald for a short while.<a id="FNanchor_A16-125" href="#Footnote_A16-125" class="fnanchor">A16-125</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr276">Occupations and Activities</h4>

<p>Ruby stated that when he and his friends arrived in Los Angeles,
they sold a handicapper’s tip sheet for horseraces at Santa Anita racetrack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_787">787</span>
which had just opened.<a id="FNanchor_A16-126" href="#Footnote_A16-126" class="fnanchor">A16-126</a> Eva Grant testified that Ruby also
worked as a singing waiter in Los Angeles, but made very little
money.<a id="FNanchor_A16-127" href="#Footnote_A16-127" class="fnanchor">A16-127</a></p>

<p>When the group moved to San Francisco, Ruby continued to sell
“tip” sheets at Bay Meadows racetrack.<a id="FNanchor_A16-128" href="#Footnote_A16-128" class="fnanchor">A16-128</a> Subsequently, he became
a door-to-door salesman of subscriptions to San Francisco newspapers.<a id="FNanchor_A16-129" href="#Footnote_A16-129" class="fnanchor">A16-129</a>
Although there is some evidence that he ultimately became
chief of his crew and had several people working under him,<a id="FNanchor_A16-130" href="#Footnote_A16-130" class="fnanchor">A16-130</a> other
reports indicate that this is unlikely.<a id="FNanchor_A16-131" href="#Footnote_A16-131" class="fnanchor">A16-131</a> Eva Grant testified that she
also sold newspaper subscriptions but was less proficient than her
brother and relied upon him for advice and support.<a id="FNanchor_A16-132" href="#Footnote_A16-132" class="fnanchor">A16-132</a></p>

<p>Although virtually all his San Francisco acquaintances knew Jack
Ruby as “Sparky,”<a id="FNanchor_A16-133" href="#Footnote_A16-133" class="fnanchor">A16-133</a> there is no evidence that he engaged in violent
activities in San Francisco or was reputed to possess a vicious temper.
One friend, who stated that he resided with Ruby and Eva for about
a year, described him as a “well-mannered, likable individual who
was soft spoken and meticulous in his dress and appearance.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-134" href="#Footnote_A16-134" class="fnanchor">A16-134</a> Another
friend described him as a “clean-cut, honest kid,”<a id="FNanchor_A16-135" href="#Footnote_A16-135" class="fnanchor">A16-135</a> and the
manager of a crew with which Ruby worked stated that he had a
good reputation and appeared to be an “honest, forthright person.”
The crew manager reported that Ruby associated with a sports crowd,
some of whose members were involved with professional boxing, but
not with criminals. He added that Ruby had a personal liking for
law enforcement and would have wanted to become a police officer had
he been larger physically.<a id="FNanchor_A16-136" href="#Footnote_A16-136" class="fnanchor">A16-136</a></p>

<p>One friend reported that although Ruby always associated with
Jewish people, he never exhibited great interest in religion.<a id="FNanchor_A16-137" href="#Footnote_A16-137" class="fnanchor">A16-137</a> Ruby
met Virginia Belasco, granddaughter of the prominent playwright
and actor, David Belasco, in about 1936 at a dance at the Jewish
community center in San Francisco. Miss Belasco stated that while
a teenager she saw Ruby socially on several occasions between 1936
and 1941.<a id="FNanchor_A16-138" href="#Footnote_A16-138" class="fnanchor">A16-138</a> The only other evidence concerning Ruby’s social activities
while in San Francisco is his statement to his long-time girl
friend, Alice Nichols of Dallas,<a id="FNanchor_A16-139" href="#Footnote_A16-139" class="fnanchor">A16-139</a> that while in San Francisco he met
the only other woman, Virginia Fitzgerald or Fitzsimmons, that he
ever considered marrying.<a id="FNanchor_A16-140" href="#Footnote_A16-140" class="fnanchor">A16-140</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr277">Chicago (1937-43)</h4>

<p>Jack Ruby stated that following his return to Chicago, he was
unemployed for a considerable period.<a id="FNanchor_A16-141" href="#Footnote_A16-141" class="fnanchor">A16-141</a> However, when his mother
was admitted to Elgin State Hospital in 1937,<a id="FNanchor_A16-142" href="#Footnote_A16-142" class="fnanchor">A16-142</a> she reported that he
was employed as a “traveling salesman” apparently living away from
home.<a id="FNanchor_A16-143" href="#Footnote_A16-143" class="fnanchor">A16-143</a> Although there is conflicting evidence about his ability to
earn a comfortable living,<a id="FNanchor_A16-144" href="#Footnote_A16-144" class="fnanchor">A16-144</a> he apparently was able to maintain a
normal existence<a id="FNanchor_A16-145" href="#Footnote_A16-145" class="fnanchor">A16-145</a> and required no financial assistance from his
family or friends. He continued to be a so-called “hustler,” scalping
tickets and buying watches and other small items for resale at discount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_788">788</span>
prices.<a id="FNanchor_A16-146" href="#Footnote_A16-146" class="fnanchor">A16-146</a> One of his closest Chicago friends stated that Ruby’s
sales and promotions were “shady” but “legitimate.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-147" href="#Footnote_A16-147" class="fnanchor">A16-147</a></p>

<p><i>Labor union activities.</i>—Ruby reported that in “about 1937” he became
active in Local 20467 of the Scrap Iron and Junk Handlers
Union.<a id="FNanchor_A16-148" href="#Footnote_A16-148" class="fnanchor">A16-148</a> At this time, his friend, attorney Leon Cooke, was the
local’s financial secretary.<a id="FNanchor_A16-149" href="#Footnote_A16-149" class="fnanchor">A16-149</a> Records provided by the Social Security
Administration indicate that Ruby was employed by the union from
late 1937 until early 1940;<a id="FNanchor_A16-150" href="#Footnote_A16-150" class="fnanchor">A16-150</a> he worked as a union organizer and negotiated
with employers on its behalf.<a id="FNanchor_A16-151" href="#Footnote_A16-151" class="fnanchor">A16-151</a></p>

<p>On December 8, 1939, the union’s president, John Martin, shot
Cooke, who died of gunshot wounds on January 5, 1940; Martin was
subsequently acquitted on the ground of self-defense.<a id="FNanchor_A16-152" href="#Footnote_A16-152" class="fnanchor">A16-152</a> Although a
Jack Rubenstein is mentioned in the minutes of a union meeting on
February 2, 1940,<a id="FNanchor_A16-153" href="#Footnote_A16-153" class="fnanchor">A16-153</a> and Ruby is reported to have said after Cooke’s
death that he wanted to “take over” the union,<a id="FNanchor_A16-154" href="#Footnote_A16-154" class="fnanchor">A16-154</a> the evidence indicates
that Ruby was so upset by Cooke’s death that he was unable to devote
himself further to union activities and left its employ.<a id="FNanchor_A16-155" href="#Footnote_A16-155" class="fnanchor">A16-155</a> Ruby reported
that after Cooke’s death he adopted the middle name “Leon,”
which he used only infrequently, in memory of his friend.<a id="FNanchor_A16-156" href="#Footnote_A16-156" class="fnanchor">A16-156</a></p>

<p>Since Ruby was the ultimate source of all but one of these accounts,<a id="FNanchor_A16-157" href="#Footnote_A16-157" class="fnanchor">A16-157</a>
other descriptions of Ruby’s separation from the union cannot with
certainty be deemed inaccurate. These reports indicated that Ruby
might have been forced out of the union by a criminal group, or might
have left because he lacked the emotional stability necessary for sucessful
labor negotiations<a id="FNanchor_A16-159" href="#Footnote_A16-159" class="fnanchor">A16-159</a> or because he felt he was not earning enough
money with the union.<a id="FNanchor_A16-160" href="#Footnote_A16-160" class="fnanchor">A16-160</a></p>

<p>Although the AFL-CIO investigated the ethical practices of local
20467 in 1956, placed the local in trusteeship, and suspended Paul
Dorfman, who succeeded Martin and Cooke, there is no evidence that
Ruby’s union activities were connected with Chicago’s criminal element.<a id="FNanchor_A16-161" href="#Footnote_A16-161" class="fnanchor">A16-161</a>
Several longtime members of the union reported that it had
a good reputation when Ruby was affiliated with it<a id="FNanchor_A16-162" href="#Footnote_A16-162" class="fnanchor">A16-162</a> and employers
who negotiated with it have given no indication that it had criminal
connections.<a id="FNanchor_A16-163" href="#Footnote_A16-163" class="fnanchor">A16-163</a></p>

<p><i>Subsequent employment.</i>—In 1941, Ruby and Harry Epstein organized
the Spartan Novelty Co., a small firm that sold in various
northeastern States small cedar chests containing candy and gambling
devices known as punchboards.<a id="FNanchor_A16-164" href="#Footnote_A16-164" class="fnanchor">A16-164</a> Earl Ruby and two of Jack Ruby’s
friends, Martin Gimpel and Martin Shargol, were also associated in
this venture. The group had no fixed addresses, living in hotels.<a id="FNanchor_A16-165" href="#Footnote_A16-165" class="fnanchor">A16-165</a></p>

<p>Late in 1941, Jack Ruby returned to Chicago, where he continued
his punchboard business through the mails.<a id="FNanchor_A16-166" href="#Footnote_A16-166" class="fnanchor">A16-166</a> Following the December
7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, he and several friends decided
to design and sell plaques commemorating the Day of Infamy. However,
the venture was impeded by Ruby’s perfectionistic approach to
details of design which resulted in numerous production delays.<a id="FNanchor_A16-167" href="#Footnote_A16-167" class="fnanchor">A16-167</a>
By the time Ruby’s copyrighted plaque <a id="FNanchor_A16-168" href="#Footnote_A16-168" class="fnanchor">A16-168</a> was finally ready for sale,
the market was flooded with similar items.<a id="FNanchor_A16-169" href="#Footnote_A16-169" class="fnanchor">A16-169</a> At about this time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_789">789</span>
Ruby also sold busts of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.<a id="FNanchor_A16-170" href="#Footnote_A16-170" class="fnanchor">A16-170</a> In late 1942
and 1943, Ruby was employed by the Globe Auto Glass Co.<a id="FNanchor_A16-171" href="#Footnote_A16-171" class="fnanchor">A16-171</a> and
Universal Sales Co.<a id="FNanchor_A16-172" href="#Footnote_A16-172" class="fnanchor">A16-172</a></p>

<p>Although one of Ruby’s acquaintances at this time described him as
a cuckoo nut on the subject of patriotism,<a id="FNanchor_A16-173" href="#Footnote_A16-173" class="fnanchor">A16-173</a> the evidence does not
indicate that Ruby’s promotion of “Remember Pearl Harbor” plaques
and Roosevelt busts was motivated by patriotic or political considerations.
Rather, the sale of these items was, to Ruby, just another
commercial venture, but he might also have considered these sales
“a good thing.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-174" href="#Footnote_A16-174" class="fnanchor">A16-174</a> Numerous friends reported that Ruby had no
interest in political affairs during this period,<a id="FNanchor_A16-175" href="#Footnote_A16-175" class="fnanchor">A16-175</a> although he greatly
admired President Roosevelt.<a id="FNanchor_A16-176" href="#Footnote_A16-176" class="fnanchor">A16-176</a></p>

<p><i>Other activities.</i>—The evidence indicates that Ruby led a normal
social life during these years. Virginia Belasco stated that while
Ruby was selling punchboards in New York during November 1941,
he entertained her each weekend.<a id="FNanchor_A16-177" href="#Footnote_A16-177" class="fnanchor">A16-177</a> Other reports indicate that Ruby
fancied himself a “ladies’ man,” enjoyed dancing, almost always had
female accompaniment and was “very gentlemanly” with women.<a id="FNanchor_A16-178" href="#Footnote_A16-178" class="fnanchor">A16-178</a></p>

<p>Ruby, with several friends, frequently attempted to disrupt rallies
of the German-American Bund.<a id="FNanchor_A16-179" href="#Footnote_A16-179" class="fnanchor">A16-179</a> One acquaintance reported that
Ruby was responsible for “cracking a few heads” of Bund members.<a id="FNanchor_A16-180" href="#Footnote_A16-180" class="fnanchor">A16-180</a>
Apparently he joined in this activity for ethnic rather than political
reasons. The young men in the group were not organized adherents
of any particular political creed, but were poolhall and tavern companions
from Ruby’s Jewish neighborhood who gathered on the spur
of the moment to present opposition when they learned that the pro-Nazi
and anti-Semitic Bund movement was planning a meeting.<a id="FNanchor_A16-181" href="#Footnote_A16-181" class="fnanchor">A16-181</a>
Hyman Rubenstein testified that Ruby would fight with any person
making derogatory comments about his ethnic origins, and others
have stated that Ruby would fight with anyone he suspected of pro-Nazi
or anti-Semitic tendencies.<a id="FNanchor_A16-182" href="#Footnote_A16-182" class="fnanchor">A16-182</a></p>

<p>During this period Ruby, though temperamental, apparently engaged
in no unusual acts of violence. However, he did interfere on
several occasions when he thought someone was treated unfairly. A
friend who described Ruby as “somewhat overbearing regarding the
rights and feelings of others,” reported that Ruby fought two college
students who insulted a Negro piano player.<a id="FNanchor_A16-183" href="#Footnote_A16-183" class="fnanchor">A16-183</a> Another friend reported
that Ruby had a “bitter” fight with a man who was abusing
an older woman.<a id="FNanchor_A16-184" href="#Footnote_A16-184" class="fnanchor">A16-184</a></p>

<p>Maintaining his friendship with Barney Ross, and still an ardent
sports fan, Ruby associated with various figures in the boxing world
and regularly attended the fights at Marigold Gardens.<a id="FNanchor_A16-185" href="#Footnote_A16-185" class="fnanchor">A16-185</a> He frequented
the Lawndale Poolroom and Restaurant, a rallying point for
the anti-Bundists and chief “hangout” of many of Ruby’s friends.<a id="FNanchor_A16-186" href="#Footnote_A16-186" class="fnanchor">A16-186</a>
In addition, Ruby, described as a “health nut”<a id="FNanchor_A16-187" href="#Footnote_A16-187" class="fnanchor">A16-187</a> who earnestly contended
that he could hit harder than Joe Louis,<a id="FNanchor_A16-188" href="#Footnote_A16-188" class="fnanchor">A16-188</a> exercised at several
athletic clubs.<a id="FNanchor_A16-189" href="#Footnote_A16-189" class="fnanchor">A16-189</a></p>

<p>Despite Ruby’s participation in “shady” financial enterprises, his
association with a labor union subsequently disciplined by the AFL-CIO,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_790">790</span>
his participation in violent anti-Bund activities, and his connection
with a poolroom, the evidence falls short of demonstrating that
Ruby was significantly affiliated with organized crime in Chicago.
Virtually all of Ruby’s Chicago friends stated he had no close connection
with organized crime.<a id="FNanchor_A16-190" href="#Footnote_A16-190" class="fnanchor">A16-190</a> In addition, unreliable as their
reports may be, several known Chicago criminals have denied any
such liaison.<a id="FNanchor_A16-191" href="#Footnote_A16-191" class="fnanchor">A16-191</a> The Commission finds it difficult to attach credence
to a newspaper reporter’s contrary statement that his undisclosed
“syndicate sources” revealed Ruby was connected with organized
crime and confidence games.<a id="FNanchor_A16-192" href="#Footnote_A16-192" class="fnanchor">A16-192</a> Ruby was unquestionably familiar,
if not friendly, with some Chicago criminals,<a id="FNanchor_A16-193" href="#Footnote_A16-193" class="fnanchor">A16-193</a> but there is no evidence
that he ever participated in organized criminal activity.</p>

<h3 id="hdr278">MILITARY ACTIVITIES (1943-46)</h3>

<p>In September 1941, Jack Ruby was apparently classified 1-A<a id="FNanchor_A16-194" href="#Footnote_A16-194" class="fnanchor">A16-194</a>
and declared eligible for the draft. Subsequently he appeared before
a local board and was reclassified 1-H or 3-A.<a id="FNanchor_A16-195" href="#Footnote_A16-195" class="fnanchor">A16-195</a> Between August
31, 1941, and November 19, 1942, when it was abolished, the 1-H
classification applied to registrants who had reached their 28th birthday
and were, therefore, no longer liable for service.<a id="FNanchor_A16-196" href="#Footnote_A16-196" class="fnanchor">A16-196</a> The 3-A
deferment applies to persons whose entry into military service presents
financial hardship to dependents. Because of the length of time
involved and the destruction of local draft board records, Ruby’s
precise status or the reason for his deferment could not be ascertained.<a id="FNanchor_A16-197" href="#Footnote_A16-197" class="fnanchor">A16-197</a>
According to one somewhat unreliable report, Ruby, immediately
prior to his physical examination, feigned a hearing disability
and occasionally wore a hearing aid.<a id="FNanchor_A16-198" href="#Footnote_A16-198" class="fnanchor">A16-198</a> Hyman Rubenstein, who testified
that Jack was deferred because of economic hardship since he was
“the only one home,” specifically denied the truthfulness of this allegation.<a id="FNanchor_A16-199" href="#Footnote_A16-199" class="fnanchor">A16-199</a>
Early in 1943, Ruby was again classified 1-A, and, following
an unsuccessful appearance before his appeal board, he was
inducted into the U.S. Army Air Forces on May 21, 1943.<a id="FNanchor_A16-200" href="#Footnote_A16-200" class="fnanchor">A16-200</a> Jack was
the last of the Rubenstein brothers to enter the service. Previously,
Earl had enlisted in the Navy, Sam was in Army Air Force Intelligence
and Hyman was in the field artillery.<a id="FNanchor_A16-201" href="#Footnote_A16-201" class="fnanchor">A16-201</a></p>

<p>Except for 5 weeks in Farmingdale, N.Y., Ruby spent his military
days at various airbases in the South.<a id="FNanchor_A16-202" href="#Footnote_A16-202" class="fnanchor">A16-202</a> He received the basic training
given all recruits and advanced training as an aircraft mechanic.<a id="FNanchor_A16-203" href="#Footnote_A16-203" class="fnanchor">A16-203</a>
On August 2, 1943, he passed marksmanship tests with the .30 caliber
carbine and the .45 caliber submachinegun, but failed with the .30
caliber rifle. On February 10, 1944, he earned a sharpshooter’s rating
for his firing of an M1 .30 caliber carbine. His character and efficiency
ratings, when determined, were excellent.<a id="FNanchor_A16-204" href="#Footnote_A16-204" class="fnanchor">A16-204</a> After attaining
the rank of private first class and receiving the good conduct medal,
Ruby was honorably discharged on February 21, 1946.<a id="FNanchor_A16-205" href="#Footnote_A16-205" class="fnanchor">A16-205</a></p>

<p>Two persons who recalled Ruby while he was in the Army Air Forces
asserted that he was extremely sensitive to insulting remarks about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_791">791</span>
Jews.<a id="FNanchor_A16-206" href="#Footnote_A16-206" class="fnanchor">A16-206</a> When, during an argument, a sergeant called Ruby a “Jew
bastard,” Ruby reportedly attacked him and beat him with his fists.<a id="FNanchor_A16-207" href="#Footnote_A16-207" class="fnanchor">A16-207</a></p>

<p>There is conflicting evidence about the zeal with which Ruby performed
his military duties. One associate indicated that Ruby, who
at 34 was the oldest in his group, always worked harder than the
others to prove that he could keep up with them.<a id="FNanchor_A16-208" href="#Footnote_A16-208" class="fnanchor">A16-208</a> Another recalled,
by contrast, that Ruby had “no liking for work” and carefully avoided
situations requiring him to dirty his hands.<a id="FNanchor_A16-209" href="#Footnote_A16-209" class="fnanchor">A16-209</a> However, there is no
basis in the record for the inference that Ruby was in any way anti-American.</p>

<p>Ruby frequently expressed to some fellow soldiers his high regard
for Franklin Delano Roosevelt.<a id="FNanchor_A16-210" href="#Footnote_A16-210" class="fnanchor">A16-210</a> Two independent sources
reported that he cried openly when informed of Roosevelt’s death
in April 1945.<a id="FNanchor_A16-211" href="#Footnote_A16-211" class="fnanchor">A16-211</a> This did not indicate any sudden political interest,
however, since none of his known military associates reported such an
interest, and Ruby’s admiration for President Roosevelt anteceded his
military days.<a id="FNanchor_A16-212" href="#Footnote_A16-212" class="fnanchor">A16-212</a></p>

<p>While in service, Ruby is reported to have continued his promotional
ventures. One person recalled that in 1944, Jack received
punchboards and chocolates from someone in Chicago and peddled
these items through the base to make extra money. This person also
indicated that Ruby enjoyed card and dice games in or near the
barracks.<a id="FNanchor_A16-213" href="#Footnote_A16-213" class="fnanchor">A16-213</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr279">POSTWAR CHICAGO (1946-47)</h3>

<p>Following his discharge from the Army Air Forces in February
1946, Jack Ruby returned to Chicago. He joined his three brothers,
who had previously been discharged from the service,<a id="FNanchor_A16-214" href="#Footnote_A16-214" class="fnanchor">A16-214</a> in the Earl
Products Co. Earl Ruby testified that he was the sole investor in
the enterprise, but each brother received an equal ownership interest
on his return from the service.<a id="FNanchor_A16-215" href="#Footnote_A16-215" class="fnanchor">A16-215</a> The company manufactured and
sold small cedar chests and distributed punchboards.<a id="FNanchor_A16-216" href="#Footnote_A16-216" class="fnanchor">A16-216</a> In addition,
it made aluminum salt and pepper shakers, key chains, bottle openers,
screwdrivers, and small hammers.<a id="FNanchor_A16-217" href="#Footnote_A16-217" class="fnanchor">A16-217</a> Sam supervised the manufacturing
end of the business, while Earl managed the office and advertising.<a id="FNanchor_A16-218" href="#Footnote_A16-218" class="fnanchor">A16-218</a>
Jack was in charge of sales, but the company was small and
he had no subordinates.<a id="FNanchor_A16-219" href="#Footnote_A16-219" class="fnanchor">A16-219</a></p>

<p>Because insufficient profits led to frequent arguments, Hyman soon
left Earl Products.<a id="FNanchor_A16-220" href="#Footnote_A16-220" class="fnanchor">A16-220</a> Jack, who stayed with the company through
most of 1947, had many disputes with his brothers because he insisted
on selling the products of other companies, such as costume jewelry,
and he did not like traveling outside the Chicago area. Earl and
Sam finally purchased Jack’s interest, paying him more than $14,000
in cash.<a id="FNanchor_A16-221" href="#Footnote_A16-221" class="fnanchor">A16-221</a></p>

<p>Although there is some evidence to the contrary,<a id="FNanchor_A16-222" href="#Footnote_A16-222" class="fnanchor">A16-222</a> it is unlikely
that Ruby was in the nightclub business in Chicago during the postwar
period. Many who have reported this may have mistaken him
for Harry Rubenstein,<a id="FNanchor_A16-223" href="#Footnote_A16-223" class="fnanchor">A16-223</a> who was convicted of manslaughter and operated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_792">792</span>
several such establishments.<a id="FNanchor_A16-224" href="#Footnote_A16-224" class="fnanchor">A16-224</a> None of Jack Ruby’s close
friends or relatives indicated that he was in the nightclub business.</p>

<p>Following his return from the Army, Ruby was described as ready
to fight with any person who insulted Jews or the military.<a id="FNanchor_A16-225" href="#Footnote_A16-225" class="fnanchor">A16-225</a> Earl
Ruby testified that on one occasion in 1946, Jack returned from downtown
Chicago with his suit covered with blood. He explained at that
time that he had fought with a person who had called him a “dirty
Jew or something like that.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-226" href="#Footnote_A16-226" class="fnanchor">A16-226</a></p>

<p>Other evidence indicates that Ruby’s personality was not substantially
changed by his military experience. One person who met him in
1947, reported that Ruby was a “fashionable” dresser.<a id="FNanchor_A16-227" href="#Footnote_A16-227" class="fnanchor">A16-227</a> He continued
to be described as soft spoken,<a id="FNanchor_A16-228" href="#Footnote_A16-228" class="fnanchor">A16-228</a> although he was also known as
hot-tempered.<a id="FNanchor_A16-229" href="#Footnote_A16-229" class="fnanchor">A16-229</a> Ruby worked out regularly at an athletic club,<a id="FNanchor_A16-230" href="#Footnote_A16-230" class="fnanchor">A16-230</a>
and one friend regarded him as a “Romeo,” who was quite successful
in attracting young women.<a id="FNanchor_A16-231" href="#Footnote_A16-231" class="fnanchor">A16-231</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr280">DALLAS (1947-63)</h3>

<h4 id="hdr281">The Move to Dallas</h4>

<p>During World War II, Ruby’s sister, Eva Grant, visited Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_A16-232" href="#Footnote_A16-232" class="fnanchor">A16-232</a>
Having operated a restaurant on the west coast and considering it
a lucrative business, she arranged, near the end of 1945, to lease
a building under construction in Dallas, which she ran as a nightclub.<a id="FNanchor_A16-233" href="#Footnote_A16-233" class="fnanchor">A16-233</a>
Part of the financing for this establishment, the Singapore
Supper Club, was provided by her brothers. Jack Ruby, who apparently
obtained the money from Earl Products, sent $1,100 as a downpayment
on the lease, Earl contributed about $1,500, and Hyman paid
for more than $2,000 worth of equipment.<a id="FNanchor_A16-234" href="#Footnote_A16-234" class="fnanchor">A16-234</a></p>

<p>Before she opened the Singapore in 1947, Eva Grant engaged in the
sale of metal products.<a id="FNanchor_A16-235" href="#Footnote_A16-235" class="fnanchor">A16-235</a> In that year she met Paul Roland Jones,
who allegedly was seeking customers for iron pipe and whom she referred
to Hyman Rubenstein.<a id="FNanchor_A16-236" href="#Footnote_A16-236" class="fnanchor">A16-236</a> Jones had, at about that time, been
convicted of attempting to bribe the newly elected sheriff of Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_A16-237" href="#Footnote_A16-237" class="fnanchor">A16-237</a>
On October 24, 1947, he was arrested for violating Federal narcotics
statutes.<a id="FNanchor_A16-238" href="#Footnote_A16-238" class="fnanchor">A16-238</a> Jack Ruby had visited Dallas early in 1947 to help Eva
Grant manage the Singapore,<a id="FNanchor_A16-239" href="#Footnote_A16-239" class="fnanchor">A16-239</a> and 5 days after Jones’ arrest, Jack
and Hyman Rubenstein were interrogated in Chicago by agents of
the Bureau of Narcotics.<a id="FNanchor_A16-240" href="#Footnote_A16-240" class="fnanchor">A16-240</a> The brothers admitted knowing Jones but
denied awareness of his connection with narcotics. During the 2 years
in which Jones was appealing his conviction he and other criminals
frequented the Singapore Club, then operated by Jack Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_A16-241" href="#Footnote_A16-241" class="fnanchor">A16-241</a></p>

<p>Intensive investigation to determine whether Jack Ruby was criminally
or otherwise connected with Jones’ narcotics violation leads the
Commission to conclude Ruby probably was not involved.<a id="FNanchor_A16-242" href="#Footnote_A16-242" class="fnanchor">A16-242</a> A search
of the files of the Bureau of Narcotics disclosed no record that either
Hyman or Jack had been prosecuted by Federal authorities in 1947.<a id="FNanchor_A16-243" href="#Footnote_A16-243" class="fnanchor">A16-243</a>
Jack, Hyman, and Eva denied participating in any narcotics activities.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_793">793</span>
Jones and his coconspirators also denied that Jack was a participant.<a id="FNanchor_A16-244" href="#Footnote_A16-244" class="fnanchor">A16-244</a>
One of Jones’ confederates reported after the shooting of
Oswald that although Jones “propositioned” the two brothers concerning
narcotics, they refused to participate.<a id="FNanchor_A16-245" href="#Footnote_A16-245" class="fnanchor">A16-245</a> Moreover, when one
of the conspirators was arrested with 48 pounds of raw opium in his
possession, he implicated Jones and another person, both of whom were
convicted, but he did not implicate Jack Ruby or his brother.<a id="FNanchor_A16-246" href="#Footnote_A16-246" class="fnanchor">A16-246</a></p>

<p>Late in 1947, Ruby established permanent residence in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_A16-247" href="#Footnote_A16-247" class="fnanchor">A16-247</a>
Shortly after shooting Oswald, Ruby stated that he returned to Dallas
at Eva Grant’s request, to help her operate the Singapore Supper
Club.<a id="FNanchor_A16-248" href="#Footnote_A16-248" class="fnanchor">A16-248</a> However, on December 21, 1963, he reported that although association
with his sister had been the purpose of his initial visit to Dallas,
he returned there because of the failure of his “merchandising
deals” in Chicago.<a id="FNanchor_A16-249" href="#Footnote_A16-249" class="fnanchor">A16-249</a> These factors, in conjunction with his separation
from Earl Products,<a id="FNanchor_A16-250" href="#Footnote_A16-250" class="fnanchor">A16-250</a> probably motivated Ruby’s move to Dallas.</p>

<p>A different reason has been given by Steve Guthrie, former sheriff of
Dallas. Guthrie reported that shortly after his election as sheriff
in July 1946, Paul Roland Jones, representing other Chicago criminals,
offered him a substantial amount of money to permit them to
move in and manage illegal activities in Dallas. Although he never
met Ruby, Guthrie asserted that these criminals frequently mentioned
that Ruby would operate a “fabulous” restaurant as a front for
gambling activities.<a id="FNanchor_A16-251" href="#Footnote_A16-251" class="fnanchor">A16-251</a></p>

<p>Despite its source, the Commission finds it difficult to accept this
report. A member of the Dallas Police Department, Lt. George E.
Butler, who was present during virtually all the conversations between
Guthrie and Jones and who performed considerable investigative
work on the case, stated that Ruby was not involved in the
bribery attempt and that he had not heard of Ruby until the investigation
and trial of Jones had been completed. He explained that
Ruby’s connection with the case stemmed from the fact that, as mentioned
previously, Jones and other criminals frequented the Singapore
Supper Club.<a id="FNanchor_A16-252" href="#Footnote_A16-252" class="fnanchor">A16-252</a> And 22 recordings of the conversations between
Guthrie, Butler, and Jones not only fail to mention Ruby, but indicate
that Jones was to bring from outside the Dallas area only one confederate,
who was not to be Jewish.<a id="FNanchor_A16-253" href="#Footnote_A16-253" class="fnanchor">A16-253</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr282">The Change of Name</h4>

<p>Sometime in 1947, Jack Ruby’s brothers Earl and Sam, pursuant to
a joint understanding, legally changed their names from Rubenstein
to Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_A16-254" href="#Footnote_A16-254" class="fnanchor">A16-254</a> Earl testified that he changed his name because everyone
called him Ruby and because a former employer advised him that it
was preferable not to use a “Jewish name” on mail orders for Earl
Products.<a id="FNanchor_A16-255" href="#Footnote_A16-255" class="fnanchor">A16-255</a></p>

<p>On December 30, 1947, Jack changed his name to Jack L. Ruby
by securing a decree from the 68th Judicial District Court of Dallas.
His petition alleged that he sought the change because the name Rubenstein
was misunderstood and too long and because he was “well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_794">794</span>
known” as Jack L. Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_A16-256" href="#Footnote_A16-256" class="fnanchor">A16-256</a> The Bureau of Narcotics report of his
relationship with Paul Roland Jones indicates that as of October 29,
1947, Jack was known as Ruby;<a id="FNanchor_A16-257" href="#Footnote_A16-257" class="fnanchor">A16-257</a> however, several persons in Dallas
knew him as Rubenstein.<a id="FNanchor_A16-258" href="#Footnote_A16-258" class="fnanchor">A16-258</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr283">Nightclub Operations</h4>

<p>Except for a brief period in about 1953, when Ruby managed the
Ervay Theater, a motion picture house,<a id="FNanchor_A16-259" href="#Footnote_A16-259" class="fnanchor">A16-259</a> the operation of nightclubs
and dancehalls was his primary source of income, and his basic interest
in life during the 16 years he spent in Dallas prior to shooting Lee
Oswald. When Ruby first arrived in Dallas in 1947, he and Eva Grant
jointly managed the Singapore Supper Club.<a id="FNanchor_A16-260" href="#Footnote_A16-260" class="fnanchor">A16-260</a> Shortly thereafter, she
returned to the west coast. Except for sporadic trips to Dallas, she
remained there until 1959, leaving Ruby a power of attorney.<a id="FNanchor_A16-261" href="#Footnote_A16-261" class="fnanchor">A16-261</a> Ruby,
who had received $14,000 from the sale of his interest in Earl Products,<a id="FNanchor_A16-262" href="#Footnote_A16-262" class="fnanchor">A16-262</a>
invested a substantial amount in the club, which Mrs. Grant
described as “too nice a club for that part of town.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-263" href="#Footnote_A16-263" class="fnanchor">A16-263</a> Ruby changed
the Singapore’s name to the Silver Spur Club. It was operated primarily
as a dancehall, serving beer to its patrons.<a id="FNanchor_A16-264" href="#Footnote_A16-264" class="fnanchor">A16-264</a> In about 1952,
Ruby borrowed $3,700 from a friend, Ralph Paul, to purchase the Bob
Wills Ranch House<a id="FNanchor_A16-265" href="#Footnote_A16-265" class="fnanchor">A16-265</a> with Martin Gimpel, a former associate in the
Spartan Novelty Co.<a id="FNanchor_A16-266" href="#Footnote_A16-266" class="fnanchor">A16-266</a> The Ranch House was run as a western-type
nightclub.<a id="FNanchor_A16-267" href="#Footnote_A16-267" class="fnanchor">A16-267</a></p>

<p>With two establishments to run, Ruby experienced substantial
financial reversals in 1952. He abandoned his interest in the Ranch
House and, on July 1, 1952, transferred the Silver Spur to Gimpel and
Willie Epstein, who assumed some of its debts.<a id="FNanchor_A16-268" href="#Footnote_A16-268" class="fnanchor">A16-268</a> Disappointed by
these setbacks, Ruby stated that he had a “mental breakdown,” and
“hibernated” in the Cotton Bowl Hotel in Dallas for 3 or 4 months,
declining to see his friends.<a id="FNanchor_A16-269" href="#Footnote_A16-269" class="fnanchor">A16-269</a> Still depressed, he then returned to
Chicago, apparently intending to remain there permanently.<a id="FNanchor_A16-270" href="#Footnote_A16-270" class="fnanchor">A16-270</a> However,
he stayed only 6 weeks. Gimpel and Epstein were anxious to
be rid of the Silver Spur and Ruby once again became its owner.<a id="FNanchor_A16-271" href="#Footnote_A16-271" class="fnanchor">A16-271</a></p>

<p>In 1953, Ruby obtained an interest in the Vegas Club, which he
operated with Joe Bonds until September 1953.<a id="FNanchor_A16-272" href="#Footnote_A16-272" class="fnanchor">A16-272</a> At that time he
informed Irving Alkana, who had retained a prior ownership interest,
that he was unable to meet his obligations with respect to the
club. Alkana then assumed management of the Vegas until June 19,
1954, when, following numerous disagreements with him, he sold Ruby
his interest.<a id="FNanchor_A16-273" href="#Footnote_A16-273" class="fnanchor">A16-273</a></p>

<p>Ruby still owned the Vegas Club at the time of his arrest on November
24, 1963. However, when Eva Grant returned from San Francisco
in 1959, she assumed management of the club, receiving a salary
but no ownership interest.<a id="FNanchor_A16-274" href="#Footnote_A16-274" class="fnanchor">A16-274</a> The Vegas, which occasionally featured
striptease acts,<a id="FNanchor_A16-275" href="#Footnote_A16-275" class="fnanchor">A16-275</a> employed a dance band and served beer, wine, soft
drinks, and some prepared foods.<a id="FNanchor_A16-276" href="#Footnote_A16-276" class="fnanchor">A16-276</a></p>

<p>In 1954, Ruby’s Vegas associate, Joe Bonds, was convicted of sodomy
and sent to a Texas penitentiary to serve an 8-year sentence.<a id="FNanchor_A16-277" href="#Footnote_A16-277" class="fnanchor">A16-277</a> In 1955,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_795">795</span>
Ruby sold the Silver Spur to Roscoe “Rocky” Robinson; however,
Robinson could not obtain a license to operate the club and it was
subsequently closed.<a id="FNanchor_A16-278" href="#Footnote_A16-278" class="fnanchor">A16-278</a> For a few months during this period, Ruby
also operated Hernando’s Hideaway, but this venture proved
unsuccessful.<a id="FNanchor_A16-279" href="#Footnote_A16-279" class="fnanchor">A16-279</a></p>

<p>Sam Ruby testified that shortly after he sold his interest in Earl
Products in mid-1955 and moved to Dallas, he loaned Jack $5,500 to
enable him to pay Federal excise taxes on the Vegas. As security for
the loan, Sam required Jack to execute a bill of sale of the Vegas.
Upon Jack’s default in payment, Sam instituted suit, claiming that
he owned the Vegas and that Jack had breached his promise to repurchase
it. The case was ultimately settled, with Jack retaining his
ownership interest in the club.<a id="FNanchor_A16-280" href="#Footnote_A16-280" class="fnanchor">A16-280</a></p>

<p>In late 1959, Jack Ruby became a partner of Joe Slatin in establishing
the Sovereign Club, a private club that was apparently permitted
by Texas law to sell liquor to members.<a id="FNanchor_A16-281" href="#Footnote_A16-281" class="fnanchor">A16-281</a> Since Slatin was
troubled about Dallas news stories describing police raids on a private
club that permitted gambling, he felt he needed more capital.<a id="FNanchor_A16-282" href="#Footnote_A16-282" class="fnanchor">A16-282</a> Ruby
invested about $6,000 which he borrowed from his brother Earl and
perhaps some of his own money.<a id="FNanchor_A16-283" href="#Footnote_A16-283" class="fnanchor">A16-283</a></p>

<p>The Sovereign was described as a “plush” and exclusive club, and
Ruby was apparently very anxious to attract a wealthy “carriage”
trade.<a id="FNanchor_A16-284" href="#Footnote_A16-284" class="fnanchor">A16-284</a> The venture was not successful, however. The two men
could not work together, and Slatin withdrew in early 1960.<a id="FNanchor_A16-285" href="#Footnote_A16-285" class="fnanchor">A16-285</a> Ruby
turned for new capital to Ralph Paul,<a id="FNanchor_A16-286" href="#Footnote_A16-286" class="fnanchor">A16-286</a> who had operated a Dallas
club with Joe Bonds.<a id="FNanchor_A16-287" href="#Footnote_A16-287" class="fnanchor">A16-287</a> Ruby still owed Paul $1,200 of the $3,700 loan
made in connection with the Bob Wills Ranch House, but Paul advanced
him another $2,200, which allowed him to pay the Sovereign’s
rent for 4 months. Subsequently, Ruby spontaneously gave Paul a
stock certificate representing 50 percent of the equity of the corporation
owning the club. Ruby told Paul that if the venture failed, the
Sovereign’s fixtures and other physical property would belong to
Paul.<a id="FNanchor_A16-288" href="#Footnote_A16-288" class="fnanchor">A16-288</a></p>

<p>Experiencing difficulty in recruiting sufficient members, Ruby soon
found himself again unable to pay the Sovereign’s monthly rent of
$550. Again he turned to Paul, who loaned him $1,650 on the condition
that he change the club’s method of operation. Paul insisted that
Ruby discontinue club memberships, even though this would prevent
the sale of liquor, and offer striptease shows as a substitute attraction.
Ruby agreed, and the Sovereign’s name was changed to the Carousel
Club.<a id="FNanchor_A16-289" href="#Footnote_A16-289" class="fnanchor">A16-289</a> It became one of three downtown Dallas burlesque clubs<a id="FNanchor_A16-290" href="#Footnote_A16-290" class="fnanchor">A16-290</a>
and served champagne, beer, “setups” and pizza, its only food.<a id="FNanchor_A16-291" href="#Footnote_A16-291" class="fnanchor">A16-291</a> The
Carousel generally employed four strippers, a master of ceremonies,
an assistant manager, a band, three or four waitresses, and a porter or
handyman.<a id="FNanchor_A16-292" href="#Footnote_A16-292" class="fnanchor">A16-292</a> Net receipts averaged about $5,000 per month,<a id="FNanchor_A16-293" href="#Footnote_A16-293" class="fnanchor">A16-293</a> most
of which was allocated to the club’s payroll.<a id="FNanchor_A16-294" href="#Footnote_A16-294" class="fnanchor">A16-294</a> Late in 1963, Ruby
began to distribute “permanent passes” to the Carousel;<a id="FNanchor_A16-295" href="#Footnote_A16-295" class="fnanchor">A16-295</a> however,
the cards were apparently designed solely for publicity and did not
affect the club’s legal status.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_796">796</span></p>

<h4 id="hdr284">Employee Relationships</h4>

<p>Ruby’s employees displayed a wide range of personal reactions to
him. Those associated with Ruby long enough to grow accustomed to
his violent temper and constant threats of discharge generally portray
him sympathetically.<a id="FNanchor_A16-296" href="#Footnote_A16-296" class="fnanchor">A16-296</a> They reported he was genuinely interested in
their welfare and happiness. In addition, many former employees
stated that he was a pleasant or unobjectionable employer.<a id="FNanchor_A16-297" href="#Footnote_A16-297" class="fnanchor">A16-297</a></p>

<p>There is also considerable evidence that Ruby tended to dominate his
employees, frequently resorted to violence in dealing with them, publicly
embarrassed them,<a id="FNanchor_A16-298" href="#Footnote_A16-298" class="fnanchor">A16-298</a> sometimes attempted to cheat them of their
pay,<a id="FNanchor_A16-299" href="#Footnote_A16-299" class="fnanchor">A16-299</a> and delayed paying their salaries.<a id="FNanchor_A16-300" href="#Footnote_A16-300" class="fnanchor">A16-300</a> Other employees reported
Ruby continually harassed his help,<a id="FNanchor_A16-301" href="#Footnote_A16-301" class="fnanchor">A16-301</a> and used obscene language in
their presence.<a id="FNanchor_A16-302" href="#Footnote_A16-302" class="fnanchor">A16-302</a> However he frequently apologized, sought to atone
for his many temper tantrums,<a id="FNanchor_A16-303" href="#Footnote_A16-303" class="fnanchor">A16-303</a> and completely forgot others.<a id="FNanchor_A16-304" href="#Footnote_A16-304" class="fnanchor">A16-304</a></p>

<p>One of the many violent incidents that were reported took place in
1950, when Ruby struck an employee over the head with a blackjack.<a id="FNanchor_A16-305" href="#Footnote_A16-305" class="fnanchor">A16-305</a>
In 1951, after his guitarist, Willis Dickerson, told Ruby to “go to
hell,” Ruby knocked Dickerson to the ground, then pinned him to a
wall and kicked him in the groin. During the scuffle, Dickerson bit
Ruby’s finger so badly that the top half of Ruby’s left index finger
was amputated.<a id="FNanchor_A16-306" href="#Footnote_A16-306" class="fnanchor">A16-306</a> In approximately 1955, Ruby beat one of his
musicians with brass knuckles; the musician’s mouth required numerous
stitches.<a id="FNanchor_A16-307" href="#Footnote_A16-307" class="fnanchor">A16-307</a></p>

<p>During 1960, Ruby and two entertainers, Breck Wall and Joe Peterson,
entered into an agreement that the performers would produce and
star in a revue at the Sovereign in exchange for a 50-percent interest
in the club.<a id="FNanchor_A16-308" href="#Footnote_A16-308" class="fnanchor">A16-308</a> After performing for 2 months, the entertainers complained
that they had received neither a share of the profits nor
evidence of their proprietary interest. Ruby responded by hitting
Peterson in the mouth, knocking out a tooth. The two men left the
Sovereign’s employ, but they subsequently accepted Ruby’s apology
and resumed their friendship with him.<a id="FNanchor_A16-309" href="#Footnote_A16-309" class="fnanchor">A16-309</a></p>

<p>In September 1962, Frank Ferraro, the Carousel’s handyman, became
involved in a dispute at a nearby bar. Ruby told him not to get
into a fight, and Ferraro told Ruby to mind his own business. Ruby
then followed Ferraro to another club and beat him severely. Ferraro
required emergency hospital treatment for his eye, but he decided not
to press charges since Ruby paid for his hospital care.<a id="FNanchor_A16-310" href="#Footnote_A16-310" class="fnanchor">A16-310</a> In March
1963, during an argument about wages, Ruby threatened to throw a
cigarette girl down the stairs of the Carousel.<a id="FNanchor_A16-311" href="#Footnote_A16-311" class="fnanchor">A16-311</a></p>

<p>Ruby’s relationship with his employees commanded much of his
attention during the months preceding the assassination. The Carousel’s
comparatively high turnover rate<a id="FNanchor_A16-312" href="#Footnote_A16-312" class="fnanchor">A16-312</a> and Ruby’s intense desire to
succeed<a id="FNanchor_A16-313" href="#Footnote_A16-313" class="fnanchor">A16-313</a> required him to meet numerous prospective employees,
patrons, and other persons who might help improve his business.</p>

<p>Ruby frequently encountered difficulties with the American Guild of
Variety Artists (AGVA), the union which represented Carousel entertainers.<a id="FNanchor_A16-314" href="#Footnote_A16-314" class="fnanchor">A16-314</a>
For several years, starting in about 1961, he unsuccessfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_797">797</span>
sought modification of AGVA’s policy permitting “amateur”
strippers,<a id="FNanchor_A16-315" href="#Footnote_A16-315" class="fnanchor">A16-315</a> inexperienced girls paid less than union-scale wages,<a id="FNanchor_A16-316" href="#Footnote_A16-316" class="fnanchor">A16-316</a>
to perform at union houses. Ruby apparently believed his two competitors,
the Weinstein brothers, were scheduling amateur shows in a
manner calculated to destroy his business.<a id="FNanchor_A16-317" href="#Footnote_A16-317" class="fnanchor">A16-317</a> Ruby’s discontent with
AGVA grew particularly acute during the late summer and early fall
of 1963 when, in addition to meeting with AGVA officials,<a id="FNanchor_A16-318" href="#Footnote_A16-318" class="fnanchor">A16-318</a> he called
upon several acquaintances, including known criminals, who, he
thought, could influence AGVA on his behalf.<a id="FNanchor_A16-319" href="#Footnote_A16-319" class="fnanchor">A16-319</a> Other problems with
AGVA arose because of his policy of continuous shows, which did not
give masters of ceremonies enough time off,<a id="FNanchor_A16-320" href="#Footnote_A16-320" class="fnanchor">A16-320</a> and his alleged use of
AGVA members to mingle with patrons to promote the consumption
of liquor.<a id="FNanchor_A16-321" href="#Footnote_A16-321" class="fnanchor">A16-321</a></p>

<p>In June 1963, Ruby visited New Orleans, where he obtained the
services of a stripper known as “Jada,”<a id="FNanchor_A16-322" href="#Footnote_A16-322" class="fnanchor">A16-322</a> who became his featured
performer.<a id="FNanchor_A16-323" href="#Footnote_A16-323" class="fnanchor">A16-323</a> Jada and Ruby had numerous contract disputes and
he was concerned about her high salary, recurrent absenteeism, and
diminishing drawing power.<a id="FNanchor_A16-324" href="#Footnote_A16-324" class="fnanchor">A16-324</a> Moreover, he thought that Jada had
deliberately exceeded even the Carousel’s liberal standards of decency
in order to cause him to lose his license or to obtain publicity for herself.<a id="FNanchor_A16-325" href="#Footnote_A16-325" class="fnanchor">A16-325</a>
On several occasions Ruby excitedly turned off the spotlights
during her act, and at the end of October 1963, he fired her.<a id="FNanchor_A16-326" href="#Footnote_A16-326" class="fnanchor">A16-326</a> However,
after Jada sued out a peace bond, she apparently recovered a
week’s salary from Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_A16-327" href="#Footnote_A16-327" class="fnanchor">A16-327</a></p>

<p>In addition to problems with its star stripper, the Carousel was
required to employ three masters of ceremonies in rapid succession
following the departure in about September 1963, of Wally Weston,
who worked there about 15 months.<a id="FNanchor_A16-328" href="#Footnote_A16-328" class="fnanchor">A16-328</a> And in early November, the
band that had played at the Vegas Club for about 8 years left the
Vegas to accept the offer of another Dallas club.<a id="FNanchor_A16-329" href="#Footnote_A16-329" class="fnanchor">A16-329</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr285">Financial Data and Tax Problems</h4>

<p>Jack Ruby’s pockets and the trunk of his car served as his bank.
With a few exceptions, Ruby and his clubs rarely employed bank
accounts.<a id="FNanchor_A16-330" href="#Footnote_A16-330" class="fnanchor">A16-330</a> Instead, Ruby carried his cash with him, paying the
bulk of his expenses and debts directly out of club receipts.<a id="FNanchor_A16-331" href="#Footnote_A16-331" class="fnanchor">A16-331</a></p>

<p>During the latter half of 1963, the Carousel, the Vegas, and Ruby
each maintained checking accounts at the Merchants State Bank in
Dallas. Balances of the latter two accounts never exceeded $275. In
July 1963, the Carousel’s account had more than $500; after August 8,
its maximum balance was less than $300. Between May 31 and November 24, 1963,
53 checks were drawn on the three accounts; with the
exception of one check for $129.47, all were for less than $100.<a id="FNanchor_A16-332" href="#Footnote_A16-332" class="fnanchor">A16-332</a> He
generally purchased cashier’s checks at the Merchants State Bank to
pay his monthly rental of $550 for the Carousel and $500 for the
Vegas.<a id="FNanchor_A16-333" href="#Footnote_A16-333" class="fnanchor">A16-333</a> He also purchased cashier’s checks during the 3 months prior
to the assassination to pay about $1,500 to the Texas State treasurer,
$110 to Temple Shearith Israel, apparently for Jewish high holy day
tickets, and $60 to the American Society of Authors and Publishers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_798">798</span><a id="FNanchor_A16-334" href="#Footnote_A16-334" class="fnanchor">A16-334</a></p>

<p>Records of the more than 50 banking institutions checked during
the investigation of Ruby’s financial affairs<a id="FNanchor_A16-335" href="#Footnote_A16-335" class="fnanchor">A16-335</a> revealed that he had
three other dormant accounts, all with small balances.<a id="FNanchor_A16-336" href="#Footnote_A16-336" class="fnanchor">A16-336</a> Two safety
deposit boxes belonging to Ruby, opened by Texas officials pursuant
to search warrants, were empty and unused for more than a year prior
to the assassination.<a id="FNanchor_A16-337" href="#Footnote_A16-337" class="fnanchor">A16-337</a> Although Ruby negotiated several loans at
the Merchants State Bank,<a id="FNanchor_A16-338" href="#Footnote_A16-338" class="fnanchor">A16-338</a> there is no evidence that he was the
maker or co-maker of other loans,<a id="FNanchor_A16-339" href="#Footnote_A16-339" class="fnanchor">A16-339</a> and, after investigation, the
Dallas Police Department found no record that Ruby cosigned the
note of any policeman at any time.<a id="FNanchor_A16-340" href="#Footnote_A16-340" class="fnanchor">A16-340</a></p>

<p>Ruby’s financial records were chaotic. One accountant abandoned
efforts to prepare income tax returns and other financial statements
because of the hopeless disarray of Ruby’s data.<a id="FNanchor_A16-341" href="#Footnote_A16-341" class="fnanchor">A16-341</a> The
record indicates that Ruby was frequently weeks, if not months, late
in filing Federal tax forms and that he held numerous conferences
with Internal Revenue agents who attempted to obtain the delinquent
statements.<a id="FNanchor_A16-342" href="#Footnote_A16-342" class="fnanchor">A16-342</a></p>

<p>Ruby encountered serious difficulties with respect to State franchise
and Federal excise and income taxes. The Texas charter of the corporation
controlling the Sovereign and Carousel clubs was canceled
in 1961, because Ruby failed to pay Texas franchise taxes.<a id="FNanchor_A16-343" href="#Footnote_A16-343" class="fnanchor">A16-343</a> And,
only after numerous conferences, did Ruby and representatives of
the Internal Revenue Service reach agreements on installment payments
of various Federal tax liabilities, to which Ruby more or less
adhered.<a id="FNanchor_A16-344" href="#Footnote_A16-344" class="fnanchor">A16-344</a></p>

<p>Ruby’s primary difficulty concerned Federal excise taxes. Advised
by an attorney that the Vegas Club, a dance hall providing food, was
not subject to Federal excise taxes because it was not a “cabaret,”
Ruby charged Vegas patrons on the assumption that no excise taxes
were due. However, his attorney reported, when Federal courts ruled
that dance halls providing “incidental” food were subject to excise
taxes as “cabarets,”<a id="FNanchor_A16-345" href="#Footnote_A16-345" class="fnanchor">A16-345</a> Ruby became liable to the Federal Government
for more than 6 years of taxes, amounting, with interest, to almost
exactly $40,000.<a id="FNanchor_A16-346" href="#Footnote_A16-346" class="fnanchor">A16-346</a></p>

<p>Ruby also fell behind on his personal income tax payments. At the
time of his arrest he owed more than $4,400 for 1959 and 1960.<a id="FNanchor_A16-347" href="#Footnote_A16-347" class="fnanchor">A16-347</a>
Remittances accompanied his 1961 and 1962 tax forms, the latter
received by the office of the Dallas District Director on September 18,
1963.<a id="FNanchor_A16-348" href="#Footnote_A16-348" class="fnanchor">A16-348</a> The following table summarizes amounts which Ruby reported
as gross and net income from the Vegas Club from 1956 to
1962; and the taxes due:<a id="FNanchor_A16-349" href="#Footnote_A16-349" class="fnanchor">A16-349</a></p>

<p>On his income tax forms, Ruby did not itemize personal deductions
and claimed only his own exemption. For 1962, Ruby reported salary
income of $650 from the corporation controlling the Carousel, and
$900 for 1961.<a id="FNanchor_A16-350" href="#Footnote_A16-350" class="fnanchor">A16-350</a></p>

<p>Ruby and officers of the Internal Revenue Service frequently discussed
methods of satisfying his large excise and income tax liability.<a id="FNanchor_A16-351" href="#Footnote_A16-351" class="fnanchor">A16-351</a>
In 1960, the Government filed tax liens for more than $20,000.<a id="FNanchor_A16-352" href="#Footnote_A16-352" class="fnanchor">A16-352</a>
In November 1962, the Government rejected Ruby’s offer
to pay $8,000 to compromise the assessed taxes of more than $20,000
because he had not filed returns for other Federal taxes and had not
paid these taxes as they became due. These other taxes, for the
period September 1959 through June 1962, amounted to an additional
$20,000.<a id="FNanchor_A16-353" href="#Footnote_A16-353" class="fnanchor">A16-353</a> In June 1963, Ruby submitted an offer of $3,000 to
compromise all past assessments; the offer was not acted upon prior to November
24, 1963.<a id="FNanchor_A16-354" href="#Footnote_A16-354" class="fnanchor">A16-354</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr286">Other Business Ventures</h4>

<p>In addition to nightclub management and ownership, Ruby participated
in numerous other commercial ventures. He was able to do so
primarily because work at the clubs consumed few of his daytime
hours. Many of Ruby’s ventures related to show business, others were
somewhat speculative promotions; almost all ended unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>While operating the Silver Spur Club, Ruby sold costume jewelry
at discount rates,<a id="FNanchor_A16-355" href="#Footnote_A16-355" class="fnanchor">A16-355</a> and, in about 1951, he sold sewing machine attachments
at the Texas State Fair.<a id="FNanchor_A16-356" href="#Footnote_A16-356" class="fnanchor">A16-356</a> Approximately a year later, he
managed a talented young Negro boy, “Little Daddy” Nelson. The
boy appeared at the Silver Spur, the Vegas Club, and the Bob Wills
Ranch House. In about 1953 or 1954, Ruby took “Little Daddy” and
his parents to Chicago to obtain a television appearance for him. However,
shortly after their arrival, Ruby was confronted by a second
woman claiming to be “Little Daddy’s” mother. Upon advice of
counsel, Ruby decided to abandon the venture.<a id="FNanchor_A16-357" href="#Footnote_A16-357" class="fnanchor">A16-357</a></p>

<p>In 1954, Ruby became interested in the sale of pizza crusts to Dallas
restaurants.<a id="FNanchor_A16-358" href="#Footnote_A16-358" class="fnanchor">A16-358</a> He is also reported to have sold an arthritic preparation<a id="FNanchor_A16-359" href="#Footnote_A16-359" class="fnanchor">A16-359</a>
and to have manufactured and sold “Miniron,” a liquid vitamin
formula.<a id="FNanchor_A16-360" href="#Footnote_A16-360" class="fnanchor">A16-360</a> In about 1958 or 1959, Ruby attempted to build and sell
log cabins at a Texas lake resort.<a id="FNanchor_A16-361" href="#Footnote_A16-361" class="fnanchor">A16-361</a> In early 1959, he investigated the
possibility of selling jeeps to Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_A16-362" href="#Footnote_A16-362" class="fnanchor">A16-362</a> He is also reported to have furnished
entertainment for a Dallas hotel,<a id="FNanchor_A16-363" href="#Footnote_A16-363" class="fnanchor">A16-363</a> to have promoted records
for musicians<a id="FNanchor_A16-364" href="#Footnote_A16-364" class="fnanchor">A16-364</a> and to have sold English stainless steel razor blades.<a id="FNanchor_A16-365" href="#Footnote_A16-365" class="fnanchor">A16-365</a></p>

<p>In October 1963 Ruby assisted the producers of a carnival show,
“How Hollywood Makes Movies,” appearing at the Texas State
Fair.<a id="FNanchor_A16-366" href="#Footnote_A16-366" class="fnanchor">A16-366</a> At about this time Ruby also sought to open a new club in
Dallas. He conferred with numerous persons and placed advertisements
in Dallas newspapers in an attempt to obtain financial backing.<a id="FNanchor_A16-367" href="#Footnote_A16-367" class="fnanchor">A16-367</a>
Assuming that he would be occupied by the new club, Ruby offered
his oldest brother, Hyman, a managerial post at the Carousel.
However, Hyman, who had recently lost his sales territory, declined
the offer because he felt he was too old for the nightclub business.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_800">800</span><a id="FNanchor_A16-368" href="#Footnote_A16-368" class="fnanchor">A16-368</a></p>

<p>Ruby unsuccessfully attempted to sell “twistboards,” an exercising
device consisting of two square fiberboards separated by ball bearings.
Despite the contrary advice of his brother Earl,<a id="FNanchor_A16-369" href="#Footnote_A16-369" class="fnanchor">A16-369</a> Jack ordered several
dozen twistboards and had 2,000 promotional flyers published.<a id="FNanchor_A16-370" href="#Footnote_A16-370" class="fnanchor">A16-370</a> He
had one of his strippers demonstrate the twistboards at the Texas
Products Show during the first week of November 1963.<a id="FNanchor_A16-371" href="#Footnote_A16-371" class="fnanchor">A16-371</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr287">Arrests and Violations</h4>

<p>Between 1949 and November 24, 1963, Ruby was arrested eight times
by the Dallas Police Department. The dates, charges, and dispositions
of these arrests are as follows:<a id="FNanchor_A16-372" href="#Footnote_A16-372" class="fnanchor">A16-372</a> February 4, 1949, Ruby paid
a $10 fine for disturbing the peace. July 26, 1953, Ruby was suspected
of carrying a concealed weapon; however, no charges were filed and
Ruby was released on the same day. May 1, 1954, Ruby was arrested
for allegedly carrying a concealed weapon and violating a peace bond;
again no charges were filed and Ruby was released on the same day.
December 5, 1954, Ruby was arrested for allegedly violating State
liquor laws by selling liquor after hours; the complaint was dismissed
on February 8, 1955.<a id="FNanchor_A16-373" href="#Footnote_A16-373" class="fnanchor">A16-373</a> June 21, 1959, Ruby was arrested for allegedly
permitting dancing after hours; the complaint was dismissed on July
8, 1959. August 21, 1960, Ruby was again arrested for allegedly
permitting dancing after hours; Ruby posted $25 bond and was released
on that date. February 12, 1963, Ruby was arrested on a charge
of simple assault; he was found not guilty February 27, 1963. Finally,
on March 14, 1963, Ruby was arrested for allegedly ignoring traffic
summonses: a $35 bond was posted.</p>

<p>When Ruby applied for a beer license in March 1961, he reported
that he had been arrested “about four or five times” between 1947 and
1953.<a id="FNanchor_A16-374" href="#Footnote_A16-374" class="fnanchor">A16-374</a> Between 1950 and 1963, he received 20 tickets for motor
vehicle violations, paying four $10 fines and three of $3.<a id="FNanchor_A16-375" href="#Footnote_A16-375" class="fnanchor">A16-375</a> In 1956
and 1959, Ruby was placed on 6 months’ probation as a traffic violator.</p>

<p>Ruby was also frequently suspended by the Texas Liquor Control
Board. In August 1949, when he was operating the Silver Spur, he
was suspended for 5 days on a charge of “Agents—Moral Turpitude.”
In 1953 Ruby received a 5-day suspension because of an obscene show,
and, in 1954, a 10-day suspension for allowing a drunkard on his
premises.<a id="FNanchor_A16-376" href="#Footnote_A16-376" class="fnanchor">A16-376</a> On February 18, 1954, he was suspended for 5 days because
of an obscene striptease act at the Silver Spur and for the
consumption of alcoholic beverages during prohibited hours.<a id="FNanchor_A16-377" href="#Footnote_A16-377" class="fnanchor">A16-377</a> On
March 26, 1956, Ruby was suspended by the liquor board for 3 days
because several of his checks were dishonored.<a id="FNanchor_A16-378" href="#Footnote_A16-378" class="fnanchor">A16-378</a> On October 23, 1961,
he received another 3-day suspension because an agent solicited the
sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on licensed premises.<a id="FNanchor_A16-379" href="#Footnote_A16-379" class="fnanchor">A16-379</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr288">Police Associations</h4>

<p>Although the precise nature of his relationship to members of the
Dallas Police Department is not susceptible of conclusive evaluation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_801">801</span>
the evidence indicates that Ruby was keenly interested in policemen
and their work.<a id="FNanchor_A16-380" href="#Footnote_A16-380" class="fnanchor">A16-380</a> Jesse Curry, chief of the Dallas Police Department,
testified that no more than 25 to 50 of Dallas’ almost 1,200
policemen were acquainted with Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_A16-381" href="#Footnote_A16-381" class="fnanchor">A16-381</a> However, the reports of
present and past members of the Dallas Police Department as well as
Ruby’s employees and acquaintances indicate that Ruby’s police
friendships were far more widespread than those of the average
citizen.<a id="FNanchor_A16-382" href="#Footnote_A16-382" class="fnanchor">A16-382</a></p>

<p>There is no credible evidence that Ruby sought special favors from
police officers or attempted to bribe them.<a id="FNanchor_A16-383" href="#Footnote_A16-383" class="fnanchor">A16-383</a> Although there is considerable
evidence that Ruby gave policemen reduced rates,<a id="FNanchor_A16-384" href="#Footnote_A16-384" class="fnanchor">A16-384</a> declined
to exact any cover charge from them,<a id="FNanchor_A16-385" href="#Footnote_A16-385" class="fnanchor">A16-385</a> and gave them free coffee
and soft drinks,<a id="FNanchor_A16-386" href="#Footnote_A16-386" class="fnanchor">A16-386</a> this hospitality was not unusual for a Dallas nightclub
operator.<a id="FNanchor_A16-387" href="#Footnote_A16-387" class="fnanchor">A16-387</a> Ruby’s personal attachment to police officers
is demonstrated by reports that he attended the funeral of at least
one policeman killed in action and staged a benefit performance for the
widow of another.<a id="FNanchor_A16-388" href="#Footnote_A16-388" class="fnanchor">A16-388</a> Ruby regarded several officers as personal
friends, and others had worked for him.<a id="FNanchor_A16-389" href="#Footnote_A16-389" class="fnanchor">A16-389</a> Finally, at least one policeman
regularly dated, and eventually married, one of the Carousel’s
strippers.<a id="FNanchor_A16-390" href="#Footnote_A16-390" class="fnanchor">A16-390</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr289">Underworld Ties</h4>

<p>From the time that Ruby arrived in Dallas in 1947, he was friendly
with numerous underworld figures. One of his earliest Dallas acquaintances
was Paul Roland Jones, who was convicted of attempting
to bribe the sheriff of Dallas and engaging in the sale of narcotics.<a id="FNanchor_A16-391" href="#Footnote_A16-391" class="fnanchor">A16-391</a>
Joe Bonds, one of Ruby’s partners in the Vegas Club, had a criminal
record.<a id="FNanchor_A16-392" href="#Footnote_A16-392" class="fnanchor">A16-392</a></p>

<p>Ruby, who enjoyed card playing<a id="FNanchor_A16-393" href="#Footnote_A16-393" class="fnanchor">A16-393</a> and horse racing,<a id="FNanchor_A16-394" href="#Footnote_A16-394" class="fnanchor">A16-394</a> was friendly
with several professional gamblers. In 1959, he visited Cuba at the invitation
and expense of Lewis McWillie, a professional gambler.<a id="FNanchor_A16-395" href="#Footnote_A16-395" class="fnanchor">A16-395</a>
Alice Nichols reported that Ruby’s refusal to give up gambling was
one reason why she never seriously considered marrying him.<a id="FNanchor_A16-396" href="#Footnote_A16-396" class="fnanchor">A16-396</a> When
Sidney Seidband, a Dallas gambler, was arrested in Oklahoma City, his
list of gambling acquaintances included Jack Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_A16-397" href="#Footnote_A16-397" class="fnanchor">A16-397</a> And other
friends of Ruby have been identified as gamblers.<a id="FNanchor_A16-398" href="#Footnote_A16-398" class="fnanchor">A16-398</a> Finally, two persons
of questionable reliability have reported that Ruby’s consent was
necessary before gambling or narcotics operations could be launched
in Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_A16-399" href="#Footnote_A16-399" class="fnanchor">A16-399</a></p>

<p>Based on its evaluation of the record, however, the Commission
believes that the evidence does not establish a significant link between
Ruby and organized crime. Both State and Federal officials have
indicated that Ruby was not affiliated with organized criminal activity.<a id="FNanchor_A16-400" href="#Footnote_A16-400" class="fnanchor">A16-400</a>
And numerous persons have reported that Ruby was not connected
with such activity.<a id="FNanchor_A16-401" href="#Footnote_A16-401" class="fnanchor">A16-401</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr290">Travels</h4>

<p>Despite reports that Ruby visited Havana, Las Vegas, New York,
Chicago, Honolulu, and Mexican border towns, most of his time subsequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_802">802</span>
to 1947 was spent in Dallas. Some of his travels, including his
efforts in behalf of “Little Daddy” Nelson and his visit to New Orleans
in June 1963 have been discussed.<a id="FNanchor_A16-402" href="#Footnote_A16-402" class="fnanchor">A16-402</a> Ruby stated that he went to Chicago
in 1952, in 1958 when his father died, and in August 1963 when he
met members of his family at O’Hare International Airport while en route
from New York to Dallas.<a id="FNanchor_A16-403" href="#Footnote_A16-403" class="fnanchor">A16-403</a> His August trip to New York
motivated by his difficulties with the American Guild of Variety
Artists and his desire to obtain talent, has been completely established
by hotel records.<a id="FNanchor_A16-404" href="#Footnote_A16-404" class="fnanchor">A16-404</a> Early in 1963 Ruby also traveled to Wichita,
Kans., because of his interest in stripper Gail Raven,<a id="FNanchor_A16-405" href="#Footnote_A16-405" class="fnanchor">A16-405</a> and on May 25,
1963, he apparently registered in an Oklahoma motel.<a id="FNanchor_A16-406" href="#Footnote_A16-406" class="fnanchor">A16-406</a></p>

<p>Although Ruby denies being in Las Vegas after 1937,<a id="FNanchor_A16-407" href="#Footnote_A16-407" class="fnanchor">A16-407</a> there are
unsupported rumors that he was in that city in late 1962,<a id="FNanchor_A16-408" href="#Footnote_A16-408" class="fnanchor">A16-408</a> and the
early part of November 1963.<a id="FNanchor_A16-409" href="#Footnote_A16-409" class="fnanchor">A16-409</a> Reports that he was in Las Vegas
during the weekend prior to the assassination<a id="FNanchor_A16-410" href="#Footnote_A16-410" class="fnanchor">A16-410</a> appear similarly
unfounded.<a id="FNanchor_A16-411" href="#Footnote_A16-411" class="fnanchor">A16-411</a></p>

<p>There is some uncertainty about Ruby’s trip to Havana, Cuba, in
1959. The evidence indicates that he accepted an invitation from
gambler Lewis J. McWillie, who subsequently became a violent anti-Castroite,
to visit Havana at McWillie’s expense.<a id="FNanchor_A16-412" href="#Footnote_A16-412" class="fnanchor">A16-412</a> Ruby apparently
met McWillie in about 1950, when McWillie operated a Dallas nightclub.<a id="FNanchor_A16-413" href="#Footnote_A16-413" class="fnanchor">A16-413</a>
McWillie, whom Ruby said he idolized,<a id="FNanchor_A16-414" href="#Footnote_A16-414" class="fnanchor">A16-414</a> supervised gambling
activities at Havana’s Tropicana Hotel in 1959 and later was employed
in a managerial capacity in a Las Vegas gambling establishment.<a id="FNanchor_A16-415" href="#Footnote_A16-415" class="fnanchor">A16-415</a>
Ruby testified that he went to Havana for 8 days in August
1959 and left because he was not interested in its gambling activities.<a id="FNanchor_A16-416" href="#Footnote_A16-416" class="fnanchor">A16-416</a>
McWillie corroborated this story except that he stated only that Ruby
visited Havana “sometime in 1959.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-417" href="#Footnote_A16-417" class="fnanchor">A16-417</a> Three Chicagoans reported
seeing Ruby in Havana during the Labor Day weekend in 1959.<a id="FNanchor_A16-418" href="#Footnote_A16-418" class="fnanchor">A16-418</a>
Meyer Panitz, an acquaintance of McWillie, reported that when he
met Ruby in Miami during the “summer of 1959” Ruby stated that he
was returning from a pleasure trip to Cuba.<a id="FNanchor_A16-419" href="#Footnote_A16-419" class="fnanchor">A16-419</a> The theory that the
trip to Havana had conspiratorial implications is discussed in chapter
VI. There is no reliable evidence that Ruby went to Havana subsequent
to September 1959.<a id="FNanchor_A16-420" href="#Footnote_A16-420" class="fnanchor">A16-420</a></p>

<p>Although Ruby denied ever being in Hawaii,<a id="FNanchor_A16-421" href="#Footnote_A16-421" class="fnanchor">A16-421</a> there is some evidence
that during the summer of 1961 he was in Honolulu seeking
dancing talent.<a id="FNanchor_A16-422" href="#Footnote_A16-422" class="fnanchor">A16-422</a> While it is unlikely that Ruby would forget a trip
to Honolulu in 1961, there is no other indication that such a trip, if
it occurred, had any sinister motives.</p>

<h3 id="hdr291">CHARACTER AND INTERESTS</h3>

<h4 id="hdr292">Family Relationships</h4>

<p>As mentioned previously,<a id="FNanchor_A16-423" href="#Footnote_A16-423" class="fnanchor">A16-423</a> Eva Grant was the only member of the
family living in Dallas when Ruby returned to that city in late 1947.
In 1948, she returned to the west coast, visiting Dallas sporadically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_803">803</span>
until 1959, when she assumed management of the Vegas.<a id="FNanchor_A16-424" href="#Footnote_A16-424" class="fnanchor">A16-424</a> Despite
their recurring arguments, during which they sometimes came to
blows,<a id="FNanchor_A16-425" href="#Footnote_A16-425" class="fnanchor">A16-425</a> Ruby was closer to Eva than any of his brothers or sisters.
In the summer of 1963, Eva complained bitterly to Ruby because he
gave a friend about $800 instead of paying Vegas Club bills. Eva,
citing her poor health, stated that she should be hospitalized. Ruby
rejoined that he had provided her money to enter a hospital. He
then shoved her, causing her to fall back about 8 feet and hurt her
arm and shoulder. At this point Ruby insisted he wanted her to
leave the Vegas Club.<a id="FNanchor_A16-426" href="#Footnote_A16-426" class="fnanchor">A16-426</a></p>

<p>Ruby frequently told Eva to submit to an operation and in early
November 1963 she consented. She was hospitalized for a week, leaving
about November 13.<a id="FNanchor_A16-427" href="#Footnote_A16-427" class="fnanchor">A16-427</a> While she was in the hospital, Jack called
Earl and Sam, requesting them to convey their concern to Eva.<a id="FNanchor_A16-428" href="#Footnote_A16-428" class="fnanchor">A16-428</a> According
to Eva, Jack visited her at the hospital two or three times a
day. He kept in constant touch with her throughout the weekend of
November 22.<a id="FNanchor_A16-429" href="#Footnote_A16-429" class="fnanchor">A16-429</a></p>

<p>Sam Ruby moved to Dallas from Chicago in July 1955, after selling his
interest in the Earl Products Co.<a id="FNanchor_A16-430" href="#Footnote_A16-430" class="fnanchor">A16-430</a> His son’s asthma and
Eva’s suggestion that he work as a builder in Dallas prompted the
move.<a id="FNanchor_A16-431" href="#Footnote_A16-431" class="fnanchor">A16-431</a> Apparently as a result of difficulties in collecting the $5,500
Sam loaned Jack in 1955 to pay Federal excise taxes,<a id="FNanchor_A16-432" href="#Footnote_A16-432" class="fnanchor">A16-432</a> Jack and Sam
were never particularly close to each other. However, Sam entered
into a partnership in an unsuccessful ice cream business with Jack’s
close friend, Ralph Paul.<a id="FNanchor_A16-433" href="#Footnote_A16-433" class="fnanchor">A16-433</a> Jack visited Sam and his family occasionally,
especially on Jewish holidays, and from time to time they
spoke to each other by telephone.<a id="FNanchor_A16-434" href="#Footnote_A16-434" class="fnanchor">A16-434</a></p>

<p>Jack had sporadic contacts with his brother Earl, who remained in
Chicago until about 1960, when he moved to Detroit.<a id="FNanchor_A16-435" href="#Footnote_A16-435" class="fnanchor">A16-435</a> The most
successful of the brothers, Earl often gave Jack business advice and
capital.<a id="FNanchor_A16-436" href="#Footnote_A16-436" class="fnanchor">A16-436</a> He estimated, perhaps conservatively, that, when arrested,
Jack owed him $15,000.<a id="FNanchor_A16-437" href="#Footnote_A16-437" class="fnanchor">A16-437</a> The evidence also indicates that Jack borrowed
at least $1,000, and probably more, from his sister Marion in
Chicago.<a id="FNanchor_A16-438" href="#Footnote_A16-438" class="fnanchor">A16-438</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr293">Social Relationships</h4>

<p>There have been statements that Ruby was a homosexual. The
available evidence does not support the allegation. There is no
evidence of homosexuality on his part; Ruby did not frequent
known gathering places for homosexuals,<a id="FNanchor_A16-439" href="#Footnote_A16-439" class="fnanchor">A16-439</a> many of the reports were
inherently suspect or based upon questionable or inaccurate premises,<a id="FNanchor_A16-440" href="#Footnote_A16-440" class="fnanchor">A16-440</a>
and Ruby and most of his associates and employees denied
the charge.<a id="FNanchor_A16-441" href="#Footnote_A16-441" class="fnanchor">A16-441</a> All the allegations were based on hearsay or derive
from Ruby’s lisp or a “feeling” that Ruby was a “sissy,” seemed
“weird,” acted effeminately, and sometimes spoke in a high-pitched
voice when angry.<a id="FNanchor_A16-442" href="#Footnote_A16-442" class="fnanchor">A16-442</a> Some proceeded upon the erroneous theory that
Ruby did not date women.<a id="FNanchor_A16-443" href="#Footnote_A16-443" class="fnanchor">A16-443</a></p>

<p>For the better part of 11 years, Ruby dated Mrs. Alice Reaves
Nichols, a blonde divorcee, 4 years younger than he. Mrs. Nichols,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_804">804</span>
secretary to a Dallas life insurance company executive,<a id="FNanchor_A16-444" href="#Footnote_A16-444" class="fnanchor">A16-444</a> testified
that she saw Ruby twice a week between 1948 and 1956, and once a
week from then until about 1959.<a id="FNanchor_A16-445" href="#Footnote_A16-445" class="fnanchor">A16-445</a> Ruby discussed marriage with
Mrs. Nichols,<a id="FNanchor_A16-446" href="#Footnote_A16-446" class="fnanchor">A16-446</a> but Mrs. Nichols stated that while dating Ruby she
was seeing other men and he was taking out other women.<a id="FNanchor_A16-447" href="#Footnote_A16-447" class="fnanchor">A16-447</a> Although
there are sharply conflicting reports about whether Ruby
dated women who worked for him,<a id="FNanchor_A16-448" href="#Footnote_A16-448" class="fnanchor">A16-448</a> the record indicates that Ruby
sought and enjoyed feminine company.<a id="FNanchor_A16-449" href="#Footnote_A16-449" class="fnanchor">A16-449</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr294">Affection for Dogs</h4>

<p>Ruby was extremely fond of dogs. Numerous persons stated that
he was constantly accompanied by several of the dogs he owned.<a id="FNanchor_A16-450" href="#Footnote_A16-450" class="fnanchor">A16-450</a>
Testimony at Ruby’s trial in March 1964 indicated that he referred to
his dogs as his “children.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-451" href="#Footnote_A16-451" class="fnanchor">A16-451</a> He also became extremely incensed
when he witnessed the maltreatment of any of his dogs.<a id="FNanchor_A16-452" href="#Footnote_A16-452" class="fnanchor">A16-452</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr295">Religious Interests</h4>

<p>Reared in the Jewish faith, Jack Ruby was not especially devout.
Rabbi Hillel Silverman, whose conservative temple Ruby favored, reported
that when Ruby’s father died in 1958, Ruby came to services
twice daily for the prescribed period of 11 months to recite the traditional
memorial prayer.<a id="FNanchor_A16-453" href="#Footnote_A16-453" class="fnanchor">A16-453</a> Ruby normally attended services only on
the Jewish high holy days and he was quite unfamiliar with the
Hebrew language.<a id="FNanchor_A16-454" href="#Footnote_A16-454" class="fnanchor">A16-454</a></p>

<p>Ruby was apparently somewhat sensitive to his identity as a Jew.
He forbade his comedians to tell stories directed at Jews or Jewish
practices<a id="FNanchor_A16-455" href="#Footnote_A16-455" class="fnanchor">A16-455</a> and, on several occasions after 1947, he fought with persons
making derogatory remarks about his ethnic origins.<a id="FNanchor_A16-456" href="#Footnote_A16-456" class="fnanchor">A16-456</a> The evidence
also indicates that he was deeply upset that an advertisement insulting
President Kennedy appeared above a Jewish-sounding name.<a id="FNanchor_A16-457" href="#Footnote_A16-457" class="fnanchor">A16-457</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr296">Physical Activities and Violence</h4>

<p>While in Dallas, Ruby continued attempts to keep in excellent
physical condition. He frequently exercised at the YMCA, the
Carousel, and his apartment, where he maintained a set of weights.<a id="FNanchor_A16-458" href="#Footnote_A16-458" class="fnanchor">A16-458</a>
Ruby was extremely concerned about his weight and health, including
his baldness,<a id="FNanchor_A16-459" href="#Footnote_A16-459" class="fnanchor">A16-459</a> and about his appearance in general.<a id="FNanchor_A16-460" href="#Footnote_A16-460" class="fnanchor">A16-460</a></p>

<p>Ruby’s concern for his physical well-being was partially motivated
by practical considerations, for he was his own unofficial club bouncer.
On about 15 occasions since 1950, he beat with his fists, pistol whipped,
or blackjacked patrons who became unruly.<a id="FNanchor_A16-461" href="#Footnote_A16-461" class="fnanchor">A16-461</a> At other times, he
ejected troublesome customers without a beating,<a id="FNanchor_A16-462" href="#Footnote_A16-462" class="fnanchor">A16-462</a> in many instances,
justifiably.<a id="FNanchor_A16-463" href="#Footnote_A16-463" class="fnanchor">A16-463</a> However, many people stated that he employed
more force than necessary, particularly because he often ended a fracas
by throwing his victim down the stairs of the Carousel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_805">805</span><a id="FNanchor_A16-464" href="#Footnote_A16-464" class="fnanchor">A16-464</a></p>

<p>Besides acting as a bouncer, Ruby on numerous other occasions
severely beat people who were not club patrons, usually employing
only his fists. Several of these episodes have been discussed in connection
with Ruby’s relationship with his employees.<a id="FNanchor_A16-465" href="#Footnote_A16-465" class="fnanchor">A16-465</a> In 1951, Ruby
attacked a man who had called him a “kike Jew” and knocked
out a tooth.<a id="FNanchor_A16-466" href="#Footnote_A16-466" class="fnanchor">A16-466</a> At about that time Ruby is also reported to have
knocked a man down from behind and then to have kicked him in the
face.<a id="FNanchor_A16-467" href="#Footnote_A16-467" class="fnanchor">A16-467</a> In about 1958, Ruby disarmed a man who had drawn a gun
on him at the Vegas, beat him almost to death, put the gun back in the
man’s pocket, and threw him down the stairs.<a id="FNanchor_A16-468" href="#Footnote_A16-468" class="fnanchor">A16-468</a> In 1958, Ruby reportedly
knocked down a man at the Vegas who was 6’3” tall
and weighed 230 pounds. Ruby was approximately 5’9” tall and
weighed about 175 pounds.<a id="FNanchor_A16-469" href="#Footnote_A16-469" class="fnanchor">A16-469</a> Ruby then made the man, who had
slapped his date, crawl out of the club.<a id="FNanchor_A16-470" href="#Footnote_A16-470" class="fnanchor">A16-470</a> In a fight at the Vegas,
reportedly witnessed by policemen, Ruby severely beat a heavyweight
boxer who had threatened him.<a id="FNanchor_A16-471" href="#Footnote_A16-471" class="fnanchor">A16-471</a></p>

<p>During 1962, several violent episodes occurred. Ruby beat a man
who refused to pay admission or leave and then shoved him down the
stairs.<a id="FNanchor_A16-472" href="#Footnote_A16-472" class="fnanchor">A16-472</a> He “jostled” a woman down the stairs of the Carousel and
struck her escort, who was “much smaller” than he.<a id="FNanchor_A16-473" href="#Footnote_A16-473" class="fnanchor">A16-473</a> On one occasion,
Ruby picked up a man who was arguing with his date, knocked him to
the floor, cursed him, and then removed him from the Vegas.<a id="FNanchor_A16-474" href="#Footnote_A16-474" class="fnanchor">A16-474</a> When
a cabdriver entered the Carousel and inquired about a patron who
had neglected to pay his fare, Ruby struck the cabdriver.<a id="FNanchor_A16-475" href="#Footnote_A16-475" class="fnanchor">A16-475</a></p>

<p>In February 1963, Ruby badly beat Don Tabon, who had made
some remarks about Ruby’s lady companion, injuring Tabon’s eye.<a id="FNanchor_A16-476" href="#Footnote_A16-476" class="fnanchor">A16-476</a>
Ruby was acquitted of a charge of assault and Tabon sought no monetary
relief because he believed Ruby financially incapable of satisfying
any resulting judgment. A doctor who went to the Carousel
several times between August and November 1963, stated that on
each occasion Ruby ejected someone from the club.<a id="FNanchor_A16-477" href="#Footnote_A16-477" class="fnanchor">A16-477</a></p>

<p>Buddy Turman, a prizefighter and Ruby’s friend, stated that Ruby
“picked his shots.”<a id="FNanchor_A16-478" href="#Footnote_A16-478" class="fnanchor">A16-478</a> According to Turman, a bouncer at the Vegas
for about a year, Ruby’s victim was frequently drunk, female, or otherwise
incapable of successfully resisting Ruby’s attack. The evidence
indicates that, unlike his youthful escapades, Ruby was often malicious.
He frequently felt contrite, however, when his anger had
passed or when his victim was an old acquaintance, and he would seek
to make amends for his violent temper.<a id="FNanchor_A16-479" href="#Footnote_A16-479" class="fnanchor">A16-479</a></p>

<p>With two exceptions, there is no evidence that Ruby settled disputes
with firearms. Shortly before Joe Bonds’ conviction in 1954, Ruby
is reported to have chased Bonds with a pistol.<a id="FNanchor_A16-480" href="#Footnote_A16-480" class="fnanchor">A16-480</a> And, Larry Crafard
reported that about a week before the assassination, Ruby told him
to get Ruby’s gun so that an AGVA official and former employee,
Earl Norman, could be ejected.<a id="FNanchor_A16-481" href="#Footnote_A16-481" class="fnanchor">A16-481</a> Although Ruby did not often use
his gun, it was frequently accessible when he was carrying large
amounts of money.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_806">806</span><a id="FNanchor_A16-482" href="#Footnote_A16-482" class="fnanchor">A16-482</a></p>

<h4 id="hdr297">Generosity to Friends and the Need for Recognition</h4>

<p>While Ruby often flared up and acted aggressively, he seemed to
calm down or forget his anger quickly, and there is also a great deal
of evidence that he was extremely generous to his friends. He loaned
money to them and apparently cared little whether the loans would
be repaid.<a id="FNanchor_A16-483" href="#Footnote_A16-483" class="fnanchor">A16-483</a> He was quick to offer employment to persons desperately
in need of a job<a id="FNanchor_A16-484" href="#Footnote_A16-484" class="fnanchor">A16-484</a> and he lent considerable aid to persons seeking work
elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_A16-485" href="#Footnote_A16-485" class="fnanchor">A16-485</a> Moreover, when friends or new acquaintances had no
roof over their heads, Ruby’s apartment was frequently theirs to
share.<a id="FNanchor_A16-486" href="#Footnote_A16-486" class="fnanchor">A16-486</a></p>

<p>Ruby’s unusual generosity may be explained in part by his extremely
emotional reaction to persons in distress, which may have resulted
from his firsthand familiarity with poverty, and by his unusual craving
to be recognized and relied upon.<a id="FNanchor_A16-487" href="#Footnote_A16-487" class="fnanchor">A16-487</a> Many of Ruby’s acquaintances
described him as a “publicity hound,” “glad hander,” and “name
dropper,” one always seeking to be the center of attention.<a id="FNanchor_A16-488" href="#Footnote_A16-488" class="fnanchor">A16-488</a>
Apparently the “egocentrism” of his youth<a id="FNanchor_A16-489" href="#Footnote_A16-489" class="fnanchor">A16-489</a> never left Ruby. Yet,
frequently he sought reassurance from persons he admired.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_807">807</span><a id="FNanchor_A16-490" href="#Footnote_A16-490" class="fnanchor">A16-490</a></p>

<span class="subhead">Polygraph Examination of Jack Ruby</span></h2>

<h3 id="hdr299">PRELIMINARY ARRANGEMENTS</h3>

<p>As early as December of 1963, Jack Ruby expressed his desire to
be examined with a polygraph, truth serum, or any other scientific
device which would test his veracity.<a id="FNanchor_A17-1" href="#Footnote_A17-1" class="fnanchor">A17-1</a> The attorneys who defended
Ruby in the State criminal proceedings in Texas agreed that he should
take a polygraph examination to test any conspiratorial connection
between Ruby and Oswald.<a id="FNanchor_A17-2" href="#Footnote_A17-2" class="fnanchor">A17-2</a> To obtain such a test, Ruby’s defense
counsel filed motions in court and also requested that the FBI administer
such an examination to Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_A17-3" href="#Footnote_A17-3" class="fnanchor">A17-3</a> During the course of a
psychiatric examination on May 11, 1964, Ruby is quoted as saying:
“I want to tell the truth. I want a polygraph * * *.”<a id="FNanchor_A17-4" href="#Footnote_A17-4" class="fnanchor">A17-4</a> In addition,
numerous letters were written to the President’s Commission on behalf
of Ruby requesting a polygraph examination.<a id="FNanchor_A17-5" href="#Footnote_A17-5" class="fnanchor">A17-5</a></p>

<p>When Ruby testified before the Commission in Dallas County Jail
on June 7, 1964, his first words were a request for a lie detector test.
The Commission hearing commenced with the following exchanges:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jack Ruby</span>. Without a lie detector test on my testimony,
my verbal statements to you, how do you know if I am telling
the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span> [Defense Counsel]. Don’t worry about that,
Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Just a minute, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Chief Justice <span class="smcap">Warren</span>. You wanted to ask something, did you,
Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I would like to be able to get a lie detector test or
truth serum of what motivated me to do what I did at that particular
time, and it seems as you get further into something, even
though you know what you did, it operates against you somehow,
brain washes you, that you are weak in what you want to tell the
truth about and what you want to say which is the truth.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Warren, I don’t know if you got any confidence in
the lie detector test and the truth serum, and so on.</p>

<p>Chief Justice <span class="smcap">Warren</span>. I can’t tell you just how much confidence
I have in it, because it depends so much on who is taking
it, and so forth.</p>

<p>But I will say this to you, that if you and your counsel want
any kind of test, I will arrange it for you. I would be glad to
do that, if you want it. I wouldn’t suggest a lie detector test to
testify the truth.</p>

<p>We will treat you just the same as we do any other witness, but
if you want such a test, I will arrange for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_808">808</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I do want it. Will you agree to that, Joe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. I sure do, Jack.<a id="FNanchor_A17-6" href="#Footnote_A17-6" class="fnanchor">A17-6</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Throughout Ruby’s testimony before the Commission, he repeated his
request on numerous occasions that he be given an opportunity to take
a lie detector test.<a id="FNanchor_A17-7" href="#Footnote_A17-7" class="fnanchor">A17-7</a> Ruby’s insistence on taking a polygraph examination
is reflected right to the end of the proceedings where in the very
last portion of the transcribed hearings Ruby states:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All I want to do is to tell the truth, and the only way
you can know it is by the polygraph, as that is the only way you
can know it.</p>

<p>Chief Justice <span class="smcap">Warren</span>. That we will do for you.<a id="FNanchor_A17-8" href="#Footnote_A17-8" class="fnanchor">A17-8</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Following Ruby’s insistence on a polygraph test, the Commission
initiated arrangements to have the FBI conduct such an examination.<a id="FNanchor_A17-9" href="#Footnote_A17-9" class="fnanchor">A17-9</a>
A detailed set of questions was prepared for the polygraph examination,
which was set for July 16, 1964.<a id="FNanchor_A17-10" href="#Footnote_A17-10" class="fnanchor">A17-10</a> A few days before the scheduled test,
the Commission was informed that Ruby’s sister, Eva Grant,
and his counsel, Joe H. Tonahill, opposed the polygraph on the ground
that psychiatric examinations showed that his mental state was such
that the test would be meaningless.<a id="FNanchor_A17-11" href="#Footnote_A17-11" class="fnanchor">A17-11</a></p>

<p>The Commission was advised that Sol Dann, a Detroit attorney representing
the Ruby family, had informed the Dallas office of the FBI
on July 15, 1964, that a polygraph examination would affect Ruby’s
health and would be of questionable value according to Dr. Emanuel
Tanay, a Detroit psychiatrist.<a id="FNanchor_A17-12" href="#Footnote_A17-12" class="fnanchor">A17-12</a> On that same date, Assistant Counsel
Arlen Specter discussed by telephone the polygraph examination with
Defense Counsel Joe H. Tonahill, who expressed his personal opinion
that a polygraph examination should be administered to Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_A17-13" href="#Footnote_A17-13" class="fnanchor">A17-13</a> By
letter dated July 15, 1964, Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade requested
that the polygraph examination cover the issue of premeditation
as well as the defensive theories in the case.<a id="FNanchor_A17-14" href="#Footnote_A17-14" class="fnanchor">A17-14</a></p>

<p>Against this background, it was decided that a representative of the
Commission would travel to Dallas to determine whether Jack Ruby
wanted to take the polygraph test. Since Ruby had had frequent
changes in attorneys and because he was presumed to be sane, the final
decision on the examination was his, especially in view of his prior
personal insistence on the test.<a id="FNanchor_A17-15" href="#Footnote_A17-15" class="fnanchor">A17-15</a> In the jury conference room at the
Dallas jail on July 18, Assistant Counsel Arlen Specter, representing
the Commission, informed Chief Defense Counsel Clayton Fowler, co-Counsel
Tonahill and Assistant District Attorney William F.
Alexander that the Commission was not insisting on or even requesting
that the test be taken, but was merely fulfilling its commitment to make
the examination available.<a id="FNanchor_A17-16" href="#Footnote_A17-16" class="fnanchor">A17-16</a> In the event Ruby had changed his mind
and would so state for the record, that would conclude the issue as far
as the Commission was concerned.<a id="FNanchor_A17-17" href="#Footnote_A17-17" class="fnanchor">A17-17</a></p>

<p>Chief Defense Counsel Fowler had objected to the test. He conferred
with Jack Ruby in his cell and then returned stating that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_809">809</span>
Ruby insisted on taking the examination.<a id="FNanchor_A17-18" href="#Footnote_A17-18" class="fnanchor">A17-18</a> Mr. Fowler requested
that (1) Dr. Tanay, the Detroit psychiatrist, be present; (2) the
results of the test not be disclosed other than to the Commission;
(3) the questions to be asked not be disclosed to the District Attorney’s
office; and (4) the results of the test be made available to defense
counsel.<a id="FNanchor_A17-19" href="#Footnote_A17-19" class="fnanchor">A17-19</a> Sheriff William Decker announced his intention to have
Allan L. Sweatt, his chief criminal deputy who was also a polygraph
operator, present to maintain custody of Jack Ruby while the examination
was being administered.<a id="FNanchor_A17-20" href="#Footnote_A17-20" class="fnanchor">A17-20</a> Assistant District Attorney Alexander
requested a list of questions, a copy of the recording made by the
polygraph machine and a copy of the report interpreting the test.<a id="FNanchor_A17-21" href="#Footnote_A17-21" class="fnanchor">A17-21</a>
In response to the numerous requests, the procedure was determined
that the questions to be asked of Ruby would be discussed in a preliminary
session in the presence of defense counsel, the assistant district
attorney and Chief Jailer E. L. Holman, who was to replace Sweatt.<a id="FNanchor_A17-22" href="#Footnote_A17-22" class="fnanchor">A17-22</a>
The assistant district attorney would not be present when Ruby answered
the questions, but Jailer Holman was allowed to remain to
retain custody of Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_A17-23" href="#Footnote_A17-23" class="fnanchor">A17-23</a> No commitment was made on behalf of
the Commission as to what disclosure would be made of the results
of the examination.<a id="FNanchor_A17-24" href="#Footnote_A17-24" class="fnanchor">A17-24</a> Since Dr. Tanay was not in Dallas and therefore
could not be present,<a id="FNanchor_A17-25" href="#Footnote_A17-25" class="fnanchor">A17-25</a> arrangements were made to have in attendance
Dr. William R. Beavers, a psychiatrist who had previously
examined and evaluated Ruby’s mental state.<a id="FNanchor_A17-26" href="#Footnote_A17-26" class="fnanchor">A17-26</a></p>

<p>At the conclusion of the lengthy preliminary proceedings, Ruby
entered the jury conference room at 2:23 p.m. and was informed
that the Commission was prepared to fulfill its commitment to offer
him a polygraph examination, but was not requesting the test.<a id="FNanchor_A17-27" href="#Footnote_A17-27" class="fnanchor">A17-27</a> On
behalf of the Commission, Assistant Counsel Specter warned Ruby
that anything he said could be used against him.<a id="FNanchor_A17-28" href="#Footnote_A17-28" class="fnanchor">A17-28</a> Chief Defense
Counsel Fowler advised Ruby of his objections to the examination.<a id="FNanchor_A17-29" href="#Footnote_A17-29" class="fnanchor">A17-29</a>
Ruby then stated that he wanted the polygraph examination conducted
and that he wanted the results released to the public as
promptly as possible.<a id="FNanchor_A17-30" href="#Footnote_A17-30" class="fnanchor">A17-30</a> Special Agent Bell P. Herndon, polygraph
operator of the FBI, obtained a written “consent to interview with
polygraph” signed by Jack Ruby.<a id="FNanchor_A17-31" href="#Footnote_A17-31" class="fnanchor">A17-31</a> Herndon then proceeded to
administer the polygraph examination by breaking the questions up
into series which were ordinarily nine questions in length and consisted
of relevant interrogatories and control questions.<a id="FNanchor_A17-32" href="#Footnote_A17-32" class="fnanchor">A17-32</a></p>

<h3 id="hdr301">INTERPRETATION OF THE TEST</h3>

<p>A polygraph examination is designed to detect physiological responses
to stimuli in a carefully controlled interrogation. Such responses
may accompany and indicate deception.<a id="FNanchor_A17-89" href="#Footnote_A17-89" class="fnanchor">A17-89</a> The polygraph
instrument derives its name from the Greek derivative “poly” meaning
many and the word “graph” meaning writings.<a id="FNanchor_A17-90" href="#Footnote_A17-90" class="fnanchor">A17-90</a> The polygraph
chart writings consist of three separate markings placed on a graph
reflecting three separate physiological reactions.<a id="FNanchor_A17-91" href="#Footnote_A17-91" class="fnanchor">A17-91</a> A rubber tube is
placed around the subject’s chest to record his breathing pattern on a
pneumograph.<a id="FNanchor_A17-92" href="#Footnote_A17-92" class="fnanchor">A17-92</a> That device records the respiratory ratio of inhalation
and exhalation strokes.<a id="FNanchor_A17-93" href="#Footnote_A17-93" class="fnanchor">A17-93</a> The second component is called a galvanic
skin response which consists of electrodes placed on the examinee’s
fingers, through which a small amount of electrical current is
passed to the skin.<a id="FNanchor_A17-94" href="#Footnote_A17-94" class="fnanchor">A17-94</a> The galvanometer records the minute changes in
electrical skin response.<a id="FNanchor_A17-95" href="#Footnote_A17-95" class="fnanchor">A17-95</a> The third component consists of a cardiograph
which is a tracing obtained by attaching a pneumatic cuff
around the left arm in a manner very similar to an apparatus which
takes blood pressure.<a id="FNanchor_A17-96" href="#Footnote_A17-96" class="fnanchor">A17-96</a> When the cuff is inflated, that device records
relative blood pressures or change in the heart rate.<a id="FNanchor_A17-97" href="#Footnote_A17-97" class="fnanchor">A17-97</a></p>

<p>From those testing devices, it is possible to measure psychological or
emotional stress.<a id="FNanchor_A17-98" href="#Footnote_A17-98" class="fnanchor">A17-98</a> This testing device is the product of observation
by psychologists and physiologists who noted certain physiological
responses when people lie.<a id="FNanchor_A17-99" href="#Footnote_A17-99" class="fnanchor">A17-99</a> In about 1920 law enforcement officials
with psychological and physiological training initiated the development
of the instrument to serve as an investigative aid.<a id="FNanchor_A17-100" href="#Footnote_A17-100" class="fnanchor">A17-100</a></p>

<p>The polygraph may record responses indicative of deception, but it
must be carefully interpreted.<a id="FNanchor_A17-101" href="#Footnote_A17-101" class="fnanchor">A17-101</a> The relevant questions, as to which
the interrogator is seeking to determine whether the subject is falsifying,
are compared with control questions where the examiner obtains a
known indication of deception or some expected emotional response.<a id="FNanchor_A17-102" href="#Footnote_A17-102" class="fnanchor">A17-102</a>
In evaluating the polygraph, due consideration must be given to the
fact that a physiological response may be caused by factors other than
deception, such as fear, anxiety, nervousness, dislike, and other emotions.<a id="FNanchor_A17-103" href="#Footnote_A17-103" class="fnanchor">A17-103</a>
There are no valid statistics as to the reliability of the polygraph.<a id="FNanchor_A17-104" href="#Footnote_A17-104" class="fnanchor">A17-104</a>
FBI Agent Herndon testified that, notwithstanding the
absence of percentage indicators of reliability, an informed judgment
may be obtained from a well-qualified examiner on the indications of
deception in a normal person under appropriate standards of
administration.<a id="FNanchor_A17-105" href="#Footnote_A17-105" class="fnanchor">A17-105</a></p>

<p>Ordinarily during a polygraph examination only the examiner and
the examinee are present.<a id="FNanchor_A17-106" href="#Footnote_A17-106" class="fnanchor">A17-106</a> It is the practice of the FBI, however,
to have a second agent present to take notes.<a id="FNanchor_A17-107" href="#Footnote_A17-107" class="fnanchor">A17-107</a> It is normally undesirable
to have other people present during the polygraph examination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_814">814</span>
because the examinee may react emotionally to them.<a id="FNanchor_A17-108" href="#Footnote_A17-108" class="fnanchor">A17-108</a> Because
of the numerous interested parties involved in Ruby’s polygraph examination,
there were present individuals representing the Commission
and the Dallas district attorney, as well as two defense counsel, two
FBI agents, the chief jailer, the psychiatrist, and the court reporter,
although the assistant district attorney and one defense counsel left
when Ruby was actually responding to questions while the instrument
was activated.<a id="FNanchor_A17-109" href="#Footnote_A17-109" class="fnanchor">A17-109</a> Ruby was placed in a position where there was a
minimum of distraction for him during the test.<a id="FNanchor_A17-110" href="#Footnote_A17-110" class="fnanchor">A17-110</a> He faced a wall
and could not see anyone except possibly through secondary vision
from the side.<a id="FNanchor_A17-111" href="#Footnote_A17-111" class="fnanchor">A17-111</a> Agent Herndon expressed the opinion that Ruby
was not affected by the presence of the people in the room.<a id="FNanchor_A17-112" href="#Footnote_A17-112" class="fnanchor">A17-112</a></p>

<p>Answer by Ruby to certain irrelevant control questions suggested an
attempt to deceive on those questions. For example, Ruby answered
“No” to the question “While in the service did you receive any disciplinary
action?”<a id="FNanchor_A17-113" href="#Footnote_A17-113" class="fnanchor">A17-113</a> His reaction suggested deception in his answer.<a id="FNanchor_A17-114" href="#Footnote_A17-114" class="fnanchor">A17-114</a>
Similarly, Ruby’s negative answer to the query “Did you ever over-charge
a customer?” was suggestive of deception.<a id="FNanchor_A17-115" href="#Footnote_A17-115" class="fnanchor">A17-115</a> Ruby further
showed an emotional response to other control questions such as “Have
you ever been known by another name”<a id="FNanchor_A17-116" href="#Footnote_A17-116" class="fnanchor">A17-116</a> “Are you married?”<a id="FNanchor_A17-117" href="#Footnote_A17-117" class="fnanchor">A17-117</a>
“Have you ever served time in jail?” <a id="FNanchor_A17-118" href="#Footnote_A17-118" class="fnanchor">A17-118</a> “Are your parents alive?”<a id="FNanchor_A17-119" href="#Footnote_A17-119" class="fnanchor">A17-119</a>
“Other than what you told me, did you ever hit anyone with any kind
of a weapon?”<a id="FNanchor_A17-120" href="#Footnote_A17-120" class="fnanchor">A17-120</a> Herndon concluded that the absence of any physiological
response on the relevant questions indicated that there was no
deception.<a id="FNanchor_A17-121" href="#Footnote_A17-121" class="fnanchor">A17-121</a></p>

<p>An accurate evaluation of Ruby’s polygraph examination depends
on whether he was psychotic. Since a psychotic is divorced
from reality, the polygraph tracings could not be logically interpreted
on such an individual. A psychotic person might believe a
false answer was true so he would not register an emotional response
characteristic of deception as a normal person would.<a id="FNanchor_A17-122" href="#Footnote_A17-122" class="fnanchor">A17-122</a> If a person
is so mentally disturbed that he does not understand the nature of the
questions or the substance of his answers, then no validity can be
attached to the polygraph examination.<a id="FNanchor_A17-123" href="#Footnote_A17-123" class="fnanchor">A17-123</a> Herndon stated that if
a person, on the other hand, was in touch with reality, then the polygraph
examination could be interpreted like any other such test.<a id="FNanchor_A17-124" href="#Footnote_A17-124" class="fnanchor">A17-124</a></p>

<p>Based on his previous contacts with Ruby and from observing him
during the entire polygraph proceeding, Dr. William R. Beavers testified
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the greater proportion of the time that he answered the
questions, I felt that he was aware of the questions and that he
understood them, and that he was giving answers based on an
appreciation of reality.<a id="FNanchor_A17-125" href="#Footnote_A17-125" class="fnanchor">A17-125</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Dr. Beavers further stated that he had previously diagnosed Ruby as
a “psychotic depressive.” <span class="pagenum" id="Page_815">815</span><a id="FNanchor_A17-126" href="#Footnote_A17-126" class="fnanchor">A17-126</a></p>

<p>Based on the assumption that Ruby was a “psychotic depressive,”
Herndon testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There would be no validity to the polygraph examination, and
no significance should be placed upon the polygraph charts.<a id="FNanchor_A17-127" href="#Footnote_A17-127" class="fnanchor">A17-127</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Considering other phases of Dr. Beavers’ testimony, Herndon stated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, based on the hypothesis that Ruby was mentally competent
and sound, the charts could be interpreted, and if those
conditions are fact, the charts could be interpreted to indicate
that there was no area of deception present with regard to his
response to the relevant questions during the polygraph examination.<a id="FNanchor_A17-128" href="#Footnote_A17-128" class="fnanchor">A17-128</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In stating his opinion that Ruby was in touch with reality and understood
the questions and answers, Dr. Beavers excepted two questions
where he concluded that Ruby’s underlying delusional state took
hold.<a id="FNanchor_A17-129" href="#Footnote_A17-129" class="fnanchor">A17-129</a> Those questions related to the safety of Ruby’s family and
his defense counsel.<a id="FNanchor_A17-130" href="#Footnote_A17-130" class="fnanchor">A17-130</a> While in the preliminary session Ruby had
answered those questions by stating that he felt his family and defense
counsel were in danger, he did not answer either question when the
polygraph was activated.<a id="FNanchor_A17-131" href="#Footnote_A17-131" class="fnanchor">A17-131</a> Dr. Beavers interpreted Ruby’s failure
to answer as a reflection of “internal struggle as to just what was
reality.”<a id="FNanchor_A17-132" href="#Footnote_A17-132" class="fnanchor">A17-132</a> In addition, Dr. Beavers testified that the test was not
injurious to Ruby’s mental or physical condition.<a id="FNanchor_A17-133" href="#Footnote_A17-133" class="fnanchor">A17-133</a></p>

<p>Because Ruby not only volunteered but insisted upon taking a polygraph
examination, the Commission agreed to the examination. FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover commented on the examination as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It should be pointed out that the polygraph, often referred to
as “lie detector” is not in fact such a device. The instrument is
designed to record under proper stimuli emotional responses in
the form of physiological variations which may indicate and accompany
deception. The FBI feels that the polygraph technique
is not sufficiently precise to permit absolute judgements of deception
or truth without qualifications. The polygraph technique
has a number of limitations, one of which relates to the mental
fitness and condition of the examinee to be tested.</p>

<p>During the proceedings at Dallas, Texas, on July 18, 1964,
Dr. William R. Beavers, a psychiatrist, testified that he would
generally describe Jack Ruby as a “psychotic depressive.” In
view of the serious question raised as to Ruby’s mental condition,
no significance should be placed on the polygraph examination
and it should be considered nonconclusive as the charts cannot
be relied upon.<a id="FNanchor_A17-134" href="#Footnote_A17-134" class="fnanchor">A17-134</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_816">816</span>
Having granted Ruby’s request for the examination, the Commission
is publishing the transcript of the hearing at which the test was
conducted<a id="FNanchor_A17-135" href="#Footnote_A17-135" class="fnanchor">A17-135</a> and the transcript of the deposition of the FBI polygraph
operator who administered the test.<a id="FNanchor_A17-136" href="#Footnote_A17-136" class="fnanchor">A17-136</a> The Commission did not rely
on the results of this examination in reaching the conclusions stated
in this report.</p>

evidence discussed in text, it is to be noted
that on Feb. 24, 1964, Mr. Bogard was interviewed
by the FBI in regard to his allegation
with the use of a polygraph. No
significant emotional responses were recorded
by the polygraph when Bogard was
asked relevant questions concerning his
report. The responses recorded were those
normally expected of a person telling the
truth. CE 3031. However, because of the
uncertain reliability of the results of polygraph
tests, see app. XVII, <a href="#Page_813">pp. 813-816</a>,
infra, the Commission has placed no reliance
upon these results.</p></div>

"external links", which were not supported by most eReaders when this
eBook was prepared in 2018. When using a Browser, the first time an
external link to a specific page is clicked, it may lead only to the
eBook's main page at Project Gutenberg, rather than to the selected
page within the book. Subsequent clicks of external links should lead
directly to the selected pages. If you are using an eReader that

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
